*** Neutrino Oscillation Joint fit workshop
</h1> <p>
At a satellite workshop to the 2024 NuFact Meeting, Multi-
experiment oscillation measurements and joint fits were discussed.

</a>
Results and lessons from the T2K/NOvA and T2K/Super-K analyses
were covered and possibilities for DUNE/Hyper-K and JUNO/IceCube
were discussed.  The experience of the ATLAS/CMS Higgs Combination
was also covered.

</p><h1>
*** NEUT
</h1> <p>
NEUT is a nu-nucleus interaction generator for 100 MeV to TeV nus.
It is maintained for T2K &amp; Super-K.  The source has historically
not been public, but is available upon request.  NEUT 6 is under
development for Hyper-K with the aim to release it as open source
before the end of 2024.

</p><h1>
*** GENIE
</h1> <p>
GENIE is a universal, self-consistent nu generator from MeV to PeV
energy scales from a group of active core member which maintains a
user group.  The latest release is 3.04.02 and 3.06.00 is in
development.  See
<a href="http://releases.genie-mc.org/
">
http://releases.genie-mc.org/
</a>.
GENIE covers
physics from low-energy CEvNS to ultra-high energy DIS with large
coverage in GeV region.  There are some BSM processes as well.

*** NuWro
</h1> <p>
NuWro is an event simulation based on a factorization scheme.
Nuclear effects are treated in the impulse approximation.  The
current version is 21.09.2.  Version 24 is under development.
eWro is a similar version for electrons.

</p><h1>
*** NuHEPMC </h1> (See
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13211"> arXiv:2310.13211 </a>
)
<p>
To better compare results using different nu generators, NuHEPMC
is a proposed set of agreed-upon minimal metadata beyond the true
vector of particles involved in the event.  Generator
implementations are expected to store additional metadata.  A
draft will be put on the arXiv to solicit feedback.  There are
implementations for NEUT, GENIE, NuWro, Achilles, and NUISANCE.

*** Muon Collider (MuC)
</h1> <p>
<a href="https://indico.fnal.gov/event/63406/contributions/297172/attachments/181771/249372/NUFACT_talk.pdf">
https://indico.fnal.gov/event/63406/contributions/297172/attachments/181771/249372/NUFACT_talk.pdf
</a>
A muon collider, which would be a prolific source of both muon and
electron neutrinos, was an original motivation for the NuFact
series.  In 2023, the P5 panel recommended that the US should work
on a collider with 10 TeV parton collision E, “In particular, a mu
collider presents an attractive option..."  The MuC community
plans to self-organize.  Join the mailing list at

*** Boyarsky test
</h1> <p>
In a talk on neutrinos at CERN at NuFact 2024, Alexey Boyarsky
said, "If you build an experiment, you're interested in any theory
that can be tested at your experiment and you're not interested in
any theory that can't be tested."  A likely corollary is that
theorists care most about results that can test their theories.

</p><h1>
*** IceCube has a movable detector
</h1> <p>
The IceCube detector, which measures an atmospheric neutrino every
six minutes, is sitting in antarctic ice which moves at the glacial
speed of 10 m/y.
The KM3NeT/ORCA detector with an energy threshold of
few GeV is 20% complete and will be finished in 2028.
KM3NeT/ARCA has measured the highest energy neutrino
in the 10s of PeV which triggered 3672 PMTs.  It was
a degree above the horizon, as
expected since the Earth is opaque to neutrinos above a PeV.

</p><h1>
*** Mean Excitation Energy of Liquid Argon
</h1> <p>
If you use GEANT4, the mean excitation energy is 188 eV.  This
affects the stopping power of charged particles, and hence their
energy determination in argon.  After reviewing the history of
previous measurements, Matt Strait remeasured it and found
201+-3 eV.  Many older measurements don't quote any uncertainties.
