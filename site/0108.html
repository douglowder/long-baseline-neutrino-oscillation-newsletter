*** Long-Baseline Working group at underground lab meeting
</h1>There will be a working group on long-baseline neutrino
oscillations at the conference on underground science, Lead South
Dakota October 4-7.  Milind Diwan and Panagiotis Spentzouris are
leading that working group.

*** Links for neutrino meetings

meetings page

including the Tamura School on Neutrino Physics 23-25 Nov 01,
NuINT01 at Tsukuba 13-16 Dec 01 to focus on low energy neutrino
cross sections, and a workshop to focus on large detector proton
decay and neutrinos at CERN 16-18 Jan 02.  Cooling workshop next.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Muon Cooling Workshop at CERN 25-27 October.
</h1>A neutrino factory based on a muon storage ring will study
neutrino oscillations, including leptonic CP violation.  It is
also the first step towards muon colliders, but relies on muon
cooling.  The aim of the workshop is to explore at least 2 versions of
an experiment based on existing cooling channel designs.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Off angle beams
</h1>Brookhaven proposal 889 was the first proposal for an off-axis neutrino
beam.   Today's beam designer finds that high energy proton
beams make more low energy neutrinos than low energy proton
beams, but the "high-energy tail" of the neutrino distribution
can compromise the physics.   Off angle beams greatly reduce
these high energy tails, and are being intensively studied.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Wrestling with SUMO
</h1>The bottom of Lake Superior is off-angle to the upcoming NuMI
beam line, and the fine Cerenkov properties of water are
well-known.  Larry Wai is developing an outline of a shallow
underwater Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Experiment (SUMO).
6250 pmt's would cover 5 sides of a 156 kt cube, 568m^2 sides and
could push Ue3^2 down to .003 at 5 10^-3 eV^2.

<p> </p><h1>
*** MINOS first light, first muons
</h1>With eight planes up, MINOS is now measuring cosmic muons tracks.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Is Super-Kamiokande's atmospheric neutrino analysis wrong?
</h1>An impromptu session at the Hamburg ICRC for "Comprehensive
Discussion Around the Super-Kamiokande (Atmospheric Neutrino)"
focused on complaints that e/mu separation was inadequate and
calculations of angular distributions were not "exact".  Of the
30 who came, there were no Super-Kamiokande members present to
defend the experiment, but none were needed.  Criticism was based
on inappropriate cross sections and oscillation calculations were
wrong.  Meanwhile, new Super-K results exclude nu decay at 99% CL.

<p> </p><h1>
*** The Lessons of the SSC
</h1>As the HEP community deals with how and whether to ask for the
NLC, it is important to keep in mind the lessons of the SSC, but
we don't seem to agree what they were.  Unanimity is one request
of us.  A member of the B&amp;B panel asked me why the neutrino
community didn't get together and say what we wanted.  335 of us
signed a letter asking for new experiments after MINOS and
MiniBooNE, and the Snowmass group agreed to focus on a proton
driver for a superbeam.  Other new ideas will continue to come
forward.  Do we just need a marketing strategy?

<p> </p><h1>
*** The Value of the SSC
</h1>In evaluating increased costs for the NuMI project, the DOE
recommended that "additional input should be sought from
personnel knowledgeable in the processing of claims from
underground construction projects."  A person involved in
shutting down the SSC is now of great value.  A "good"
California lawyer is also on board.

<p> </p><h1>
*** The Theory of the SSC
</h1>Are there astrophysical sources of TeV or greater E neutrinos?
Models for such sources do exist.  TeV photons are being seen
from an increasing number of nearby AGN's (new is 1426+428)
but it is unknown if protons or electrons are being accelerated
there.  Protons would create pions and yield neutrinos, but the
synchrotron self compton (SSC) model of electron acceleration is
the increasingly accepted explanation of the visible photons.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrino Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence?
</h1>This was reviewed by Pakvasa in
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0105127"> hep-ph/0105127.  </a>
The idea is that
an advanced galactically dispersed civilization needs to
accurately synchronize its clocks, and it would use Z decays, the
fastest known process.  This provides a source of 45.6 GeV nus.
