*** First KATRIN result on tritium beta decay
</h1> <p>
The long-in-development KATRIN direct mass experiment has given an
upper limit on the effective nu_e mass from tritium beta decay of
1.1 eV at 90% CL based on the first four week science run.  See
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06048"> arXiv:1909.06048 </a>.
Note that this is not the mass of any particle
but a mixture of the 3 nu masses and angles in the 3-nu paradigm.
The expected ultimate sensitivity is 0.2 eV as described in the
companion paper on KATRIN operation in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06069"> arXiv:1909.06069 </a>.

*** Neutrino 2020 registration opens
</h1> <p>
The International Conference on Neutrino Physics and Astrophysics
(Neutrino 2020), will be held 21-27 June 2020. It will take place
at the Hyatt Regency Chicago (downtown).  Poster abstracts open
1 January.
Registration is open at

*** New results from T2K
</h1> <p>
A new result on CP violation from T2K appears in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03887"> arXiv:1910.03887. </a>
This September issue is late.  More about this T2K result in October's
newsletter.

*** DUNE near detector workshop 20-23 October 2019 at DESY
</h1> <p>
This is an open workshop concentrating on the international
contributions to the DUNE Multi-Purpose (Near) Detector.

*** DUNE Module of Opportunity Workshop  12-13 Nov at Brookhaven
</h1> <p>
A preliminary technology choice has been made for 3 of the 4 10-kT
modules for the 40-kT DUNE detector.  This workshop will be a unique
opportunity to shape the technology used for the 4th DUNE module.
The Collaboration invites the broader particle physics community to
participate.

*** Neutrinos at the Fermilab art gallery
</h1> <p>
The current exhibit in the Fermilab art gallery is Cosmic Design
by Shanthi Chandrasekar through the end of October.  She wrote,
" I would sometimes imagine myself as a neutrino, racing through
the cosmos at speeds close to that of light, wondering where I
came from and where I am headed."  She made ink drawings of
neutrino pathways, appropriately three of them.

*** Rant about name badges at workshops and conferences
</h1> <p>
Most large physics meetings use name badges, with either lanyards
around the neck or clips to attach to clothing.  I don't like
lanyards, but I realize that many others don't like what clips do
to their clothes.  A very common problem with lanyards is that 50%
of the time, the name-tag is turned around and you can't see any
name.  A very few clever conferences print the name on both sides.

*** New NOvA t-shirt
</h1> <p>
An online vote chose between 4 designs for a new t-shirt honoring
neutrino oscillations for the NOvA collaboration.  Unfortunately,
the ordering closed before this newsletter issue, but you can see
the winner at

*** LBNF funding status
</h1> <p>
FY19 funding for LBNF was $130M.  The president's request for FY20
was $100M, but the House and Senate bills were $171M.  But no bill
is yet signed and the U.S. government is operating on a continuing
resolution through 21 November 2019.
