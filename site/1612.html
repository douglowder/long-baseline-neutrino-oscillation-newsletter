*** Updated two detector results from Double Chooz
</h1>
Before 2016, Double Chooz results relied on  Gd selection and
Bugey4 to provide effective near-detector-like normalization.
The latest DC two-detector results rely on IBD neutron capture in
all detector isotopes (H,C and Gd), thus expanding the FD target
volume from 8 to 30 tons.  The resulting FD IBD rate is 0.150 per
day.  The new best fit sin^2(2 theta-13) is 0.119 +/- 0.016 which
is a 2.2 sigma effect compared to Daya Bay's latest result.  A
statistical fluctuation is ruled out &gt;5 sigma, hence it is
dominated by systematics.  The DC systematic error is dominated by
a conservative estimate of the proton number (0.012). A dedicated
campaign for improved proton number estimation (including high
redundancy) is envisaged during DC decommissioning (2018).

*** Reactor directionality, Combining reactor results for theta-13
</h1>
DC has also reported the best IBD directionality results and the
most precise rate+shape reactor spectral characterization,
superseding, respectively, the previous best results from CHOOZ
and Bugey3+Bugey4; DC provides now the most precise mean-cross-
section per fission (0.564x10-42 cm^2/fission with a uncertainty:
+/-1.1%) in good agreement (&lt;1 sigma) with Bugey4. Discussion on
the compatibility and eventual combining of results from Daya Bay,
Double Chooz and RENO are ongoing.  The 1st workshop took place in
Oct 2016 (Seoul) and the next will be in mid-2017 (Paris).

*** Funding for LBNF/DUNE in 2017?
</h1>
In November, our favorite congressman told me that a funding start
for LBNF/DUNE this year looked promising.  But Congress passed a
"Continuing Resolution" through 28 April 17 which put "Science
Funding in Limbo" according to the American Institute of Physics.
In particular, it wrote, "the DOE Office of Science's request for
funds to construct the new Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility at FNAL
received support in both the House and Senate Energy-Water
appropriations bills. Without full congressional approval of this
appropriations legislation, the new construction project (won't)
be able to proceed as planned during the course of the CR."

*** NUISANCE package for studying nu cross section issues
</h1>
Current and future nu oscillation experiments have stringent
systematic error budgets which are considerably smaller than are
currently acheivable.  NUISANCE is a framework allowing detailed
studies of nu interaction cross-section models implemented in MC
nu event generators. It provides automated methods to perform
comparisons of multiple generators to published data &amp; each other.
It allows the user to easily evaluate the impact of model
parameter variations in the generators with data, or to tune the
generator predictions to arbitrary dataset combinations.

*** New Institutional Board chairs for NOvA and DUNE
</h1>
In two recent elections, Jeff Hartnell from Sussex was elected
chair of the NOvA IB, and Bob Wilson from Colorado State was
elected chair of the DUNE IB.  Both collaborations have a
co-spokesperson election in early 2017.

*** "Generations: The Story of Women in Neutrino Research"
</h1>
Actually, it is "a" story of many women in neutrino research.
It is well worth a read.

Follow the orange arrows.  Knowing Japanese is helpful but not
required.

*** 2016 Review of Particle Physics from the Particle Data Group
</h1>
Printing of the RPP by the PDG is performed by the lowest bidder.
A few years ago, one company bid zero dollars.  This sounds like a
good price (attractive to the publisher because of the high impact
factor), this leaves the PDG with no recourse if printing is late
or out-of-spec.  This year it is funding cuts which have delayed
mailing of the 2016 books till around Feb. 2017.  The entire book
is available at
<a href="http://pdg.lbl.gov">
http://pdg.lbl.gov.  </a>
For many years I carried
around the PDG pocket booklet, but with pdglive so easy to access,
I no longer do.  Similarly, schools have stopped teaching cursive.

*** European Nuclear Physics Long Range Planning
</h1>
A draft report on the future of nuclear physics in Europe is a
bit light on neutrinos.  A town hall 11-13 Jan 17 will discuss.
