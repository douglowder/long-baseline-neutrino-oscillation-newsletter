<H1>Long-Baseline news, February 2007 </H1>

<P> <H1>
*** NuMI reaches 4.05 e13 protons on Target
</H1>
This occurred during 11-batch slip-stacking studies.

*** JPARC Neutrino Beamline tunnel completed
</H1>
The 200-m long extraction beam tunnel has recently been completed.
This tunnel, with a nearly 90-degree arc, will be equipped with 
magnets and deliver a fast inward extracted proton beam from the 
synchrotron to the target. The civil construction of the target 
station has been started.   This is the beam for T2K.

*** New unit for costing neutrino experiments - milliBarish
</H1>
The International Linear Collider (ILC) global design effort has 
come up with a cost of $4.9B for a machine, $1.8B for facilities, 
+ 13000FTE years, not including the detectors, contingency or 
escalation.  This can then be described as a cost with numbers 
varying from $6.7B by the Chicago Tribune ("Cost of solving 
mysteries of universe: $6.7 billion" in the Feb 9 edition
<A href="http://www.neutrinooscillation.org/ilccost.html">
http://www.neutrinooscillation.org/ilccost.html) </A>
to $16B when 
crude estimates of detectors, contingency, manpower and escalation 
are included.  Earlier banter estimates for the ILC peaked near 
$10B, with a cluster of guesses at $9.99B.   Until a Lehman cost 
estimate is reviewed, this round number ($10B) will serve as a 
convenient unit of physics cost, or "Barish", with the more 
appropriate unit for neutrino experiments being $10M or mBarish.  
The milliBarishness of past, present and future neutrino 
experiments will be explored in this newsletter through the year.

*** Enhanced Research on Neutrino Physics at Fermilab in 08
</H1>
The 2008 DOE Budget message says "Fermilab will focus on 
investigating particles and forces at the current energy frontier, 
including enhanced research on neutrino physics."  NOvA is in the 
budget for a TPC of 26 mBarish.  3.6 mBarish in FY08

*** DUSEL Soudan proposes Institute for Underground Science (IUS)
</H1>
NSF received proposals from S. Dakota, Colorado, the U-Minnesota 
& U-Washington Jan 9 for a Deep Underground Science & Engineering 
Laboratory (DUSEL). Minnesota 
<A href="http://www.soudan.umn.edu/">
(http://www.soudan.umn.edu/) </A>
is 
proposing a multi-site DUSEL, The IUS will work with existing 
sites, including SNOLab, Soudan, Kimballton, WIPP & Homestake 4850. 
This approach is less risky & more cost-effective than a single-
site. It exploits unique features:  sedimentary rock at Kimballton, 
the NuMI beam to Soudan, infrastructure & low U-Th backgrounds at 
WIPP. It proposes to use the majority of the 1.5 mBarish available 
for DUSEL over the next three years to fund science and technology.

*** Burt Richter asks 4 Neutrino Questions at AAAS meeting
</H1>
In "Charting the course for Particle Physics" he asks 1.  Is there 
a sterile neutrino?, 2. theta-13=? 3.  Neutrino is Dirac or 
Majorana?  4.  Mass hierarchy?   He spent the most time on #1, and 
he is not a fan of blind analyses.  "We should consider the 
possibility that (MiniBooNE) will not have a conclusive result."
He likes the idea of a new neutrino experiment at Oak Ridge.
Referring to Double Chooz, Daya Bay and JPARC, he says "It would be
wise to get the new results on theta-13 before embarking on other
large and costly accelerator based neutrino experiments."

*** How to explode a Supernova 20 years after SN1987a
</H1>
<A href="http://sn1987a-20th.physics.uci.edu/Program1.htm">

SN models now 
actually explode.  It takes 3-d.  These 3-d models get asymmetric 
sloshing that make SN blow asymmetrically, even if there was no 
initial rotation.  Good news for gravity wave guys and for making 
neutron stars jet around.  The optical stuff on the remnant shows 
not only the triple-ring (which people are saying could come from 
the wind of a stellar merger, which would also explain the blue 
progenitor) but an asymmetric proto-crablike SNR forming.  Still 
no compact object seen.  There is a strong desire to build 4.4Mton
detectors to catch ~dozens of events from (<10 Mpc) galaxies.

*** The "Wispy" Neutrino on Google
</H1>
Long-Baseline News relies on physicists and non-physicists around 
the world to share information sources about neutrinos.  A
comment based on an article in this month's Science magazine
<A href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/315/5808/56?etoc">
http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/315/5808/56?etoc
</A>
was that there was a new adjective for neutrinos, "wispy".  Alas, 
typing "wispy" and "neutrinos" into Google brought 900 hits.
