*** ESSnu Design study funded
</H1> <P>
The Design Study of the project ESSnuSB, to employ the ESS linear
accelerator for an intense neutrino beam for leptonic CP violation
was granted 3 MEUR by the EU H2020 program for 4 yr; 4.7 MEUR
total cost.   15 groups are contributing. The plan is to measure a
leptonic CP-violation signal with a Megaton Water Cherenkov
detector located at the 2nd neutrino oscillation maximum where the
signal is almost 3 times stronger compared to the 1st max, making
it less sensitive to systematic uncertainties.  One study goal
is to demonstrate feasibility so ESSnu can be included in the
project priority list of the European Strategy Forum on Research
Infrastructures (ESFRI) when its updated in 2020.

*** Tau neutrino cross section proposal at SPS
</H1> <P>
NuTau appearance experiments rely on a calculated cross section
that hasn't been measured.  It is needed for lepton universality
tests in new generations of nu experiments.  A proposal to study
NuTau production at the CERN SPS can be found in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08700"> arXiv:1708.08700 </A>.

<H1>
*** LIDINE Meeting
</H1> <P>
The next meeting on LIght Detection in Noble Elements will be at
SLAC 22-24 September.

*** More meetings
</H1> <P>
Lots more neutrino meetings can be found on the Neutrino Meetings
page

*** Are there too many neutrino meetings?
</H1> <P>
No, the field is growing (as is DUNE) and nobody can or should want
to go to them all.  Many meetings gives more collaborators
opportunities for networking with  colleagues & presenting ideas.

<H1>
*** Fermilab is the mother of CERN
</H1> <P>
Someone who is mad about something made a video claiming that
DUNE is part of the antimatter agenda, whatever that means.
Is this a joke?

*** Daughter of INO, Underground Lab in India inaugurated
</H1> <P>
It is uncertain whether the India-based Neutrino Observatory's
environmental permit will happen on the needed time scale, so
there is a move to find an alternate site.  Meanwhile, the Saha
Institute of Nuclear Physics is conducting background model tests
for a dark matter experiment in the Jaduguda mine in Jharkhand.

*** PDG issue with quoting theta_23
</H1> <P>
The PDG does not do global fits for nu parameters; it averages
published values.  Since the octant is unknown but matters, it
switched a few years ago from quoting sin^2(2 theta_23) to
sin^2(theta_23).  But most experiments still quote two values.
Averaging them will always lead to sin^2(theta_23) = 0.51, for
any true value.  Till this is fixed, use the PDG value of
0.51 +- 0.04 with care.

<H1>
*** Global fit for theta_23
</H1> <P>
Several groups do perform global fits, and a recent one comes from
de Salas et al. in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01186"> arXiv:1708.01186 </A>.
  They prefer the normal order
with delta chi squared (dcsq) = 2.7 and the lower octant with
dcsq = 2.1.  Maximal mixing disfavored dcsq = 6.0.  They get
theta_23 = 41.0 +- 1.1 deg, corresponding to sin^2(theta_23)
= 0.43 +- 0.02  Other parameters in Table I.

<H1>
*** Decoherence excuse for bad neutrino grammar
</H1> <P>
Most neutrino physicists know that if long-baseline or 
short-baseline are used as adjectives, there should be a hyphen, but
mistakes do happen.  An author of 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05495"> arXiv:1708.05495 </A>
 admitted that
they missed the hyphen in "Decoherence, matter effect, neutrino
hierarchy signature in long-baseline experiments" when submitted
to the arXiv because "that's a decoherence effect you see; hits
people over 70 pretty hard .."  On the way they have an idea for
why T2K and NOvA see different apparent values of theta-23.

<H1>
*** 800 mile tunnel?
</H1> <P>
In describing long-baseline neutrino experiments to the public,
the 2nd sentence usually mentions that nu interactions are weak,
so you don't need a long tunnel.  But someone from Air & Space
magazine wasn't listening at the DUNE/LBNF groundbreaking.  In the
September issue, they wrote, "800K; The number of tons of rock
that will be excavated to build an 800-mile tunnel stretching from
South Dakota to Illinois.  Engineers broke ground in July on
(DUNE) which will study the origins of matter in the universe."
