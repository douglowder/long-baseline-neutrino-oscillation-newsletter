*** APS multidivisional Neutrino Study status
</h1>
The draft report of the APS multidivisional neutrino study is
called "The Neutrino Matrix":  matrix n:
1.  something within or from which something else originates,
develops or takes form
2.  the natural material in which something is embedded
3.  womb
4.  a rectangular array of mathematical elements.
The current goal is to finish by an October 25 DOE/NSF briefing.

*** Proton driver Workshop at Fermilab October 6-9
</h1>
There is a physics study for a 2 MW,  8 GeV proton driver with a
new Linac and 2 MW at 150 GeV.  Motivated by neutrino oscillation,
but a group is formulating an ambitious neutrino scattering
program.  They will address the specific facility design
challenges of a high-purity anti-neutrino beam, a narrow-band beam
and fine-grained detectors incorporating LH2 and LD2 targets for
both 8 GeV and 150 GeV protons on target.  A report is due in
December.  Oct 6-9 Workshop of all working groups at Fermilab:

*** Neutrino email barrage
</h1>
Usually the announcement of a workshop doesn't generate
controversy, but an email cc'd to several email lists announcing
this workshop was followed by an animated exchange started by
Burt Richter and Peter Rosen about the right next accelerator.

*** Who saw see-saws when (II)
</h1>
Professor T. Yanagida's historic paper on a natural explanation
of light neutrino masses as a consequence of the existence of a
large mass scale is now available in a recently reprinted 25th
anniversary volume:  Proceedings of the Workshop on Unified
Theories and Baryon Number in the Universe, [National Lab for HEP
(KEK), February 13-14, 2979, O. Sawada &amp; A. Sugamato (eds),
2004.]  The reprint of the Gell-Mann, Ramond and Slansky paper is
linked in 8/03 newsletter

*** Do neutrinos oscillate in air?
</h1>
MaVaNs are mass varying neutrinos as suggested by nelson
<a href="http://133.1.141.120/%7enufact04_talks/talks/28_ple_nelson.pdf">
http://133.1.141.120/%7enufact04_talks/talks/28_ple_nelson.pdf </a>
She suggests the neutrino oscillations might be matter dependent,
so Super-K, Soudan and MACRO should reanalyze their atmospheric
data not including the path lengths in the air.  New reactor
searches should be done with pathlength both in air and rock.

*** Its always good to get a phone call from Sweden

Lively discussions about neutrinos took place at a Nobel Symposium

*** Applications of Nubar Detector Technology to Counterterrorism
</h1>
VLAND (a Very Large Area Neutron Detector) is an idea to use
liquid scintillation counters for a variety of counter-terrorism
applications.

*** Auger event near 10^20
</h1>
An event near 10^20 eV was observed on May 21, 2004 at 20:59:07
near 59 degrees.  No more to be shown till ICRC in Pune.

*** A cold linear collider is the hot choice for neutrinos.

This could be a
boost for the proton driver, and hence for future nu experiments.

*** KamLAND polonium
</h1>
Bi214-&gt;Po214 make double coincidences from the Q=3.27 MeV beta
decay of Bi followed 164 usec later by a 7.7 MeV alpha from Po.
The alphas are highly-quenched (factor of 13) so they appear as
0.6 MeV events, far below the 1.8 MeV cutoff for neutrons.  Po210
gives a 5.4 MeV single alpha (quenched to 0.4 MeV) and goes almost
100% to Pb206 (small 10**-5 branching ratio to Pb206* at 0.8 MeV).

*** Unification Day Workshop, Keystone, Colorado, Oct. 15, 2004
</h1>
A 1-day workshop dedicated to Proton Decays in Unification Theories
is being organized as part of the UNO Collaboration meeting
Keystone, Colorado, Oct. 14-16. The meeting will be held at
Keystone Resorts &amp; Conference Center, Keystone, Colorado.
Tour the Henderson mine Oct. 16. The workshop is open to all.
