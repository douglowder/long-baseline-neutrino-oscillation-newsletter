*** ICARUS (at Fermilab) sees first neutrinos
</h1> <p>
The first real ICARUS nu events from the Booster proton extraction
inside a 100 microsecond window were recorded, centered around the
beam spill gate. The PMT light signal is defined by at least 10
of the 180 PMT’s of each module with at least 50 phe each, which
corresponds to an energy loss of about 3 MeV/PMT. At the nominal
drift field of 500 V/cm, the longest time for collected e's is
about 1 ms.  The anode to cathode drift distance is 1.5 m.

*** Can anyone see neutrinos?
</h1> <p>
Kirsty Duffy says no in her Bananas04 video series.  But to
paraphrase Bill Clinton, "It depends upon what the meaning of
the word 'see' is."

*** Three leading technologies for neutrinoless double beta decay
</h1> <p>
DOE-NP has identified 3 leading technologies for a ton-scale
0nu2beta detector:  1. scintillating bolomotry, 2. enriched Ge, &amp;
3. liquid xenon TPC.  1.  CUORE has operated since March 2019 at
11 mK, which indicates readiness for a ton-scale bolometer.  CUPID
is making a technical design.  2.  LEGEND is a combination of
experimenters from GERDA and Majorana.  One plan is for five
200-kg groupings of 76Ge.  3.  nEXO is a design for a liquid Xenon
cryostat submerged in an active water shield.  All 3 plan have
exceptionally challenging background constrains, &lt; 1 count/ton-y.
The DOE has monthly technical updates of LEGEND-100, nEXO &amp; CUPID.

*** Two upcoming meetings for neutrinoless double beta decay
</h1> <p>
A "Portfolio Review" (aka downselect panel) will be 13-16 Jul 2021
to inform the U.S. investment strategy for 0nu2beta experiments.
Then there will be a North American–European Summit 27-29 Sep. to
see if common ground exists for an international approach to DBD
investment.  A reasonable goal is that there be two complementary
ton-scale experiments worldwide to find DBD.

</p><h1>
*** Three leading sites for neutrinoless double beta decay
</h1> <p>
Possible locations for a ton-scale 0nu2beta project are the
Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota, SNOlab
in Sudbury, Canada, and the Gran Sasso Lab in Italy.

</p><h1>
*** Fermilab's #1 Strategic Priority
</h1> <p>
To lead the world in neutrino science with particle accelerators.

</p><h1>
*** ECFA Detector R&amp;D Roadmap
</h1> <p>
The ECFA Detector R&amp;D Roadmap Process is a follow-up of the 2020
Update of European Strategy for Particle Physics.  This will take
place 9 April to 7 May.  Nine task forces on R&amp;D issues have been
established.

*** DUNE near detector (ND) Conceptual Design Report (CDR)
</h1> <p>
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13910">
http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13910.
</a>
The DUNE ND CDR was approved by
the Long-baseline Neutrino Committee and is available.  Components
include a liquid Ar TPC (ND-LAr), a magnetized argon target system
(ND-GAr), A Precision Reaction-Independent Spectrum Measurement
near detector (DUNE-PRISM) and a System for on-Axis Neutrino
Detection (SAND).  Other sections cover neutrino cross-section,
BSM physics, SM physics, Facilities and Computing teams.

*** Neutrino is the word of the day
</h1> <p>
The biweekly DOE Science Update made neutrino the word of the
week.

But what is the word of the other week?

</p><h1>
*** Define a neutrino
</h1> <p>
I tell people neutrinos are fundamental particles not in atoms.
At a garage sale, I saw a set of World Book Encyclopedias with a
dictionary, so I looked up "neutrino".  It said, "A stable atomic
particle having no electric charge and a mass too close to zero
to be measured."  I looked up "atomic" and it was "having to do
with atoms".

</p><h1>
*** Physics, why is it plural?  (or why are physics plural?)
</h1> <p>
In "The professor &amp; the madman" the 1721 1st comprehensive English
dictionary's cover page mentions "terms of art related to botany,
anatomy, physick".  Chemistry and biology appear to be singular.
Why now "plural in form but singular or plural in construction"?
