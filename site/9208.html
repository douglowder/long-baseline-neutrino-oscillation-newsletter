</p><h1>Fermilab Users Meeting</h1>
July's message was sent out during the middle of the Fermilab
Users Meeting.  During the last talk at that meeting,
John Peoples was very upbeat in describing the plans
for the possible long baseline neutrino program.  He
offered the opinion that 10 ktons was the minimum
necessary long baseline detector.

<h1>Main injector funding</h1>
The main injector got $25 Million in the Senate, after
getting $15 Million in the house.  A reasonable
expectation for the conference committee is $20 Million
for 1992-93.  Meanwhile the environmental approval for
the Main Injector was made official on July 6 when
DOE issued a FONSI, or finding of no significant
impact.   Construction actually started on July 24th, in
the form of wetlands mitigation work.

<h1>SAGE and Gallex at the Dallas meeting: Solar nus</h1>
Earlier SAGE data from 1990 was 20 SNU + 15 - 20 (stat)
+- 32 (syst).  For 1991 they reported 85 +22 -32 +-20,
or a total of 58 +17 -24 +-14.  This compares to 83 +-19
+-8 from GALLEX and 132 for the standard solar model.
It is my opinion that an eventual answer of 72 (the
average of the two) would be good motivation for P822.

<h1>Newsletter subscribers</h1>
71 subscribers signed up for this newsletter in its
first 3 months.   If you know of anyone who might be
interested and/or doesn't mind this sort of thing
cluttering their mail files, tell them to let me know.
40 people who got the first 3 issues failed to respond
for a subscription, including 17 P822 collaborators.

<h1>CERN experiment?</h1>
Dave Cline was visiting the ANL accelerator group on
August 26th, and told Tom Fields and myself that
Gran Sasso experiments were seriously considering 80GeV
long baseline neutrino beams from CERN to Gran Sasso,
and that ICARUS in particular was scheduling an internal
workshop on the subject in the next month or so.

<h1>Brookhaven experiment?</h1>
At the September 24th HENP Program Advisory Committee
meeting at Brookhaven, there is a presentation by Al
Mann on P889, ``Long Baseline Neutrino Oscillation
Search".
