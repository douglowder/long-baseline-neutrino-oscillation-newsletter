<p> </p><h1>
*** New analysis of SuperKamiokande atmospheric neutrino data
</h1>A neutrino oscillation analysis/announcement regarding SuperK
data is expected during Neutrino '98.  A special edition of
long-baseline news will probably be sent out next week.

<p> </p><h1>
*** NOW98-Neutrino Oscillation Workshop in Amsterdam in September
</h1>A 2.5 day workshop at NIKHEF will be 7-9 September.  Information
can be obtained at

*** wet SNO
</h1>There is about eight feet of water in the cavity, but the fill was
stopped to assess how many tubes are likely to be dead (not many).
The serious fill started May 19 and there should to be heavy water
in by the end of the month. There are more than 7000 phototubes
cabled in to the electronics, the last 1000 are just about ready
to go. It will probably be another six weeks before all channels
are connected.  The fill will take two and a half months.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Baltay panel reviews MINOS
</h1>A subpanel of the Fermilab PAC reported that the physics case for
MINOS is stronger now than 3 years ago.  A small region of
allowed parameter space may not be covered, but we should proceed
and continue to be flexible.  Emulsion R&amp;D should be encouraged.

<p> </p><h1>
*** French neutrinos met
</h1>80 people attended the "Journees Neutrino" workshop to discuss
where French neutrino physics should be going.  Topics included
solar neutrinos, reactor neutrinos, astrophysics, Fermilab 's
BOONE, DONUT and MINOS, the short-baseline proposals at CERN, and
the entire Gran-Sasso program including 5 long-baseline proposals
(ICARUS, NOE, NICE, OPERA and AQUARICH).  If CERN approves the
long-baseline at the end of '98 and civil engineering tenders
went out in Spring '99, they would have a beam in 2003.  All 5
are in the range of 50M sf, and the beam is around 70M sf; sans
near detector hall.

*** Evidence for oscillations in IMB up mu data?
</h1>When an experiment stops taking data, analysis does not stop, but
it may slow down.  There was an oscillation limit from a
comparison of the upward muons (from nus) in IMB with the Volkova
flux.  But an unofficial and rough re-analysis of the shape of
the zenith  angle distribution of those up mu's agrees with
oscillations  (dmsq ~ 0.005) and disagrees with
no-oscillations at the 5 sigma  level.  See
www.phys.hawaii.edu/~jgl/post/imb_upmu_osc.html.   If true, this
might imply that the flux calculations were low by 20-40%.  But
improved cross section calculations, (Lipari et al Phys. Rev.
Let. 74,4384, 1995)  have made this inconsistency disappear.

<p> </p><h1>
*** First long-baseline neutrino Ph.D?
</h1>David Petyt successfully passed the viva-voce examination for his
D. Phil at Oxford University in May.  As far as long-baseline news
knows, this is the first D. Phil purely on an accelerator long-
baseline experiment. His next stop is the RAL Soudan/MINOS group.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Baikal Neutrino Telescope NT200 completed
</h1>On April 6, 1998, NT-200 in Lake Baikal was completed.   This is
the preliminary end of a long journey, starting in 1980 with first
site surveys at the Lake and getting a concrete form with a
192-PMT array called NT-200 in 1989/90. With a dozen
nu events identified (1994-1997), the goal is now to record
neutrinos with a 2000 m^2 detector and a 10-15 GeV threshold
(approximately 1 event/day induced by atmospheric neutrinos).  In
parallel, an upgrade towards a &gt;10 000 m^2 detector is envisaged.
The Baikal project is a Russian-German collaboration.

They point out observable effects of small nu_e admixture
(within Chooz limits) on top of nu_mu&lt;---&gt;nu_tau oscillations
of atmospheric neutrinos. A peculiar effect is studied, which is
present only for genuinely three-flavor mixing.
