<p> </p><h1>
***  K2K running in Y2K
</h1>The Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment in Japan, K2K, has
115 days of running scheduled during calendar 2000 (see
<a href="http://psux1.kek.jp/~kekps/beamtime/schedule.html">
http://psux1.kek.jp/~kekps/beamtime/schedule.html
</a>) Jan-July.

<p> </p><h1>
***  K2K results in Y1K
</h1>During last year's engineering run, there were 3 or 4 reported events,
expecting about 11-12 (with no oscillations).  Expected event rates (per
pot)
might or might not be lower than original estimates.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Homestake Cl experiment back, better
</h1>After being off for 2 years, the original solar nu experiment
has DOE/NSF funding for an automated extraction system with a
He driven refrigerator-cryostat system rather than N.  This will
permit more frequent/more complete extractions.  They are also
modifying the counters to eliminate both dead space and degraded
pulses due to end effects.  The combination should give an
increased rate and smaller systematic uncertainties.  The overall
goal is to reduce the total combined error from 8% to about 5%.
This reduction should have a significant effect on the 7Be limit after
subtraction of the 8B flux (using either the SK or SNO values).

***  Deadline close for Aspen Neutrino Workshop
</h1>The nominal deadline for applications for this outstanding
workshop Jun 26-Jul 17 is Feb 1.  Apply for 1, 2 or 3 weeks
at

***  KamLAND US approved
</h1>The US groups in the KamLAND reactor neutrino experiment
underwent a successful review in January.  The DOE will fund them
at a level of about $4M and they will continue to seek US/Japan
funds, etc.  Phototube installation starts May 8th, scintillator
fill starts in September and running on April 1, 2001.  They will
be sensitive to the Large Mixing Angle Solar neutrino solution.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Palo Verde Results
</h1>This reactor neutrino experiment has just submitted for
publication results on a search for nue disappearance about 800 m
from the three reactors at Palo Verde.  The measured flux agrees
with prediction.  This provides a second direct result that
disfavors numu to nue for the atmospheric neutrino channel.

<p> </p><h1>
*** MuMu 99
</h1>At the 5th meeting on Muon Colliders held Dec. 15-17, 1999 at San
Francisco, there were extensive discussion of possible Neutrino
Factories around the world (US, Europe, Japan).  About 110 people
were at the meeting which included talks by the US laboratory
directors about the future of their laboratories.  Proceedings
will be published by AIP press.

<p> </p><h1>
***  Neutrino Factory Working group
</h1>An interesting workshop at Fermilab on Feb 17 and 18 is taking
shape on neutrinos from a muon storage ring.  See
<a href="http://www.fnal.gov/projects/muon_collider/nu/study/two_day.html">

</a>.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Super-Kamiokande
</h1>The 825 day data, shown last summer went down to 5.5 MeV
threshold and the energy distribution (excluding where hep
neutrinos might contribute) was fairly flat.  This disfavors the
small mixing angle solution.  If the large mixing angle solution
is correct, the 2-sigma day/night effect will grow with time.

<p> </p><h1>
*** MSW is an effect, not a theory
</h1>The realization that charged current neutrino-electron scattering
introduces a term in the mass matrix that singles out e-nu's is
known as the Mikheyev, Smirnov and Wolfenstein or MSW effect.
This is currently associated with 3 of the 4 possible solar nu
solutions, and also with "regeneration" in the earth effects.
If the solar neutrino solution is "just-so" or vacuum
oscillations, the MSW effect is irrelevant.  Neutrino factories
have one design goal to go far enough to see matter effects.  It
will help in the measurement of U_e3.  It would be ironic to many
of us if it turns out the MSW effect is irrelevant for solar
neutrinos, but is then measured by accelerators.

*** Notable (twenty year-) old reference
</h1>In <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-ph/0001036">
hep-ph/0001036</a>,
P. Ramond "predicts" large numu to nutau
mixing and small numu to nue mixing.  The paper, written in 1981,
took awhile to make it to the Los Alamos archive, even though it
is based on a talk given at Los Alamos.  It's called "The case
for neutrino oscillations".

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrinos in Ferment
</h1>Burt Richter's insightful (and incite-ful?) summary talk from
Lepton-Photon makes a great read, both regarding neutrinos and
everything else.  It's "Assessment and Outlook",
