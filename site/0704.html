*** MiniBooNE refutes LSND result on oscillations
</h1>
<p>
The MiniBooNE collaboration reported first results of a search for
nu-e appearance in a numu beam. With 2 independent analyses, there
was no significant excess of events above background for energies
above 475MeV.  The data are consistent with no oscillations within
a 2 nu appearance-only oscillation model.  The result excludes 2
nu appearance-only oscillations as an explanation of LSND @ 98%CL.

*** MiniBooNE sees similar excess as LSND
</h1>
<p>
The LSND experiment had (in its final paper) a 3.9 sigma excess
which could be numubar-nuebar oscillations.  MiniBooNE has a
3.7 sigma excess in the energy range 300 MeV to
475 MeV.  If interpreted as oscillations, it is a different delta
msquared.  The cut was raised from 300 MeV to 475 MeV by a pre-
determined process of requiring good fits between the data and MC
for the presence or absence of an oscillation signature.  Reported

"The only way to reconcile the two results
(LSND &amp; MiniBooNE) would be to posit a 4th type of neutrino with
much different qualities than the currently known three."

*** Al Wattenberg's 90th Birthday
</h1>
<p>
This excellent particle physicist (who was my PhD adviser) hasn't
dabbled much in neutrinos.  But he did help build the 1st self-
sustaining neutrino source, the CP1 reactor at Stagg Field -
University of Chicago.  He marked on the floor of the squash court
with chalk where the lead bricks were to be placed.  At the time,
Lincoln Wolfenstein was a student at Chicago, and he walked by
every day, not knowing that neutrinos were pouring out.  He said
that if he had known, he probably would have walked on the other
side of the street.  Cards can be sent to Al at Meadowbrook Health
Ctr, 101 Windsor, Urbana IL 61801

*** MINOS meets in Greece, sets intensity record
</h1>
<p>
The MINOS experiment, synonymous with the ancient civilization of
Crete, met in April at the home of the collaborating institution,
University of Athens.  The Main Injector, during Slip-Stacking
studies, set a new record for the amount of beam in the machine,
at 4.6E13, with very good transport efficiency.  This beam did not
go to NuMI, as it is limited to 4.0E13 until there is a spare
target.  This intensity is what we can expect after the shutdown
in October.  NuMI has now passed 3E20 protons on target total.

*** KM3 meets in Greece, 50M Euro
</h1>
<p>
In April, the collaboration meeting of KM3NeT took place in Pylos
Greece.  It is the cubic kilometer underwater neutrino detector
to be sited in a deep spot of the Mediterranean Sea.   Prof Y.
Tsoucalas the Greek Secretary General for Science and Technology
addressed them and remarked on the recent decision/commitment of
the Greek Government (at the level of 'Kyvernitiki Epitropi'
which is chaired by the Prime Minister) to support the KM3NeT
efforts in Greece at a level of 50 million euros.

*** MINERvA gets triple play; CD 1-2-3a
</h1>
<p>
Last Month I received a multitude of explanations for 6 sixes in a
Cricket Over.  Last week, a Col. Rockie became the 13th baseball
player ever to get an unassisted triple play.  Also, the Fermilab
nu experiment Minerva simultaneously got CD-1, CD-2, and CD-3a
approval.

CD-1 is a statement that the experiment's conceptual design is the
best alternative to satisfy the "mission need".  CD-2 ratifies the
technical design for the experiment. CD-3a indicates that the
engineering designs &amp; vendor quotes are ready for the initial
purchases and fabrication required to start construction.  The DOE
has requested funding from Congress for construction of MINERvA in
its FY08 budget request.  The total construction project cost for
MINERvA is estimated 16.8M$.

*** LVD has detected the CERN CNGS beam
</h1>
<p>
LVD, a neutrino experiment in Gran Sasso, detected a CNGS neutrino
during the commissioning week - a very clear horizontal muons coming
from a numu cc interaction in the rock, in time with the beam spill.
During the first run LVD saw 582 events with 578 expected.
When regular running starts, they expect 160 events per day.

</h1>
<p>
As a followup to AAP 2006, there will be a workshop in 2007
on Applied Antineutrino Physics, focusing on issues such as
non-proliferation.  It will be December 13-14, 2007 at the
APC Laboratory, Paris, France

*** MODULAr Workshop 14-15 June at Gran Sasso
</h1>
<p>
INFN is organizing at workshop at LNGS, June 14-15, to launch the
"MODULAr" project: an improved CNGS off-axis beam fired on a 20 kt
liquid argon detector
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.1422"> (arXiv:0704.1422). </a>
You can find workshop details at
<a href="http://cryodet.lngs.infn.it/">
http://cryodet.lngs.infn.it/.  </a>
A 20 kt fiducial Liquid Argon TPC
following ICARUS-T600, an increased intensity for the 400 GeV CERN
beam, and a new experimental area 10 km off-axis CNGS are studied.
