*** Vision for long-baseline experiments at Brookhaven
</h1>
A Report from the BNL Neutrino Working Group is now available.
Informal Report BNL-69395
<a href="http://nwg.phy.bnl.gov/preprints.php">
http://nwg.phy.bnl.gov/preprints.php </a>
An intense wide band neutrino beam (.5-7GeV) from a 1MW AGS
proton source and 500 kT or larger water detector are envisaged.
The main conclusions of the report are that the bold program is
technically feasible and economically attractive.

*** Mining for MINOS
</h1>

http://vmsstreamer1.fnal.gov/VMS_Site_02/VMS/MINOS/MINOS.ram </a>
A movie on MINOS if you have real player.  ~13 minutes.
The last plane (488) is currently projected for 6/5/2003.

*** Reminder on Linking references in this newsletter
</h1>
There aren't full URL's in this email, but you can click on the
web link at the bottom of the newsletter, pick the issue,
and then direct links to the ArXiv are usually available.

*** NuMI goes from contractor to contractor
</h1>
S.A. Healy, contractor for the NuMI tunnel, is now finished, and
they have transferred the site to Ragnar Benson, contractor for
the Service Buildings and Outfitting.  The actual delivered
product is remarkably close to what was imagined and planned
for a decade.  D. Bogert commented the site "almost sparkled".

<p> </p><h1>
*** PDG reviews its reviews
</h1>
There are a number of useful reviews in the Particle Data Group's
RPP (available in the US by request, hard to get in Europe, also
on web at
<a href="http://pdg.lbl.gov/"> http://pdg.lbl.gov/) </a>
Reviews focus on neutrino flavors,
the number of nus, 0nu double beta decay, flavor change, 2 flavor
oscillation limits, 2-flavor plots, Solar nus.  Reviewing the PDG,
a committee suggested unifying the oscillation reviews and figures
and moving them into the Review section at the front of the book.

<p> </p><h1>
*** PDG neutrino parameter space plots
</h1>
Plots showing (two-neutrino) parameter space observations and
limits in the particle data book have been painstakingly put
together by Hitoshi Murayama.  They can be found at

<p> </p><h1>
*** Workshop on NuMI Off-axis at Stanford 24-26 January 03
</h1>
Proponents of different detector technologies will contribute
to the organization.  A desirable outcome of the workshop
would be convergence on a coherent plan of action towards
preparation of the proposal for the experiment.

*** Workshop NOON2002 10-14 Feb 03
</h1>
The 4th International Workshop on Neutrino Oscillations and their
Origin (NOON2003) will be held at Ishikawa Kousei-Nenkin Kaikan,
Kanazawa, Japan, from February 10th to February 14th of 2003.
Kanazawa,~50km from Kamioka, is called a small Kyoto.  Workshops
are linked from

*** Two neutrino superbeam experiments are better than one
</h1>
The issue is resolving parameter degeneracies, and these are the
kinds of issues facing future experimental proposals.  Barger et
al. have quantitatively addressed this in
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph//0210428"> hep-ph/0210428. </a>

<p> </p><h1>
*** Misusing quantum mechanics
</h1>
From time to time, people write down the 2-neutrino probability
of oscillation, improperly compound approximations, and get the
wrong answer by two.  This has been done again in "...The Gribov-
Pontecorvo phase for neutrino vacuum propagation is right"
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0211199"> hep-ph/0211199.  </a>
Similarly in
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0208086"> hep-ph/0208086.  </a>
But Okun et al.
show that Pontecorvo got the correct standard expression in late
publications, and in the earlier ones, based on the same
assumptions, there was either a simple math mistake or misprint.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Bi-Large Mixing
</h1>
Now that Bi-maximal mixing is fairly well ruled out, theory still
needs to explain why theta_23 and theta_12 are large.  One ansatz
which works is the Fritzsch texture (see
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0210276"> hep-ph/0210276).  </a>
Though
neutrinoless double beta decay would be too small to be observed,
CP violation could be measured in new long-baseline experiments,
and theta_23 should not be maximal.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Anarchy or Hierarchy?
</h1>
Which form for model of neutrino mass is more likely?  According
to Altarelli et al., (
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0210342"> hep-ph/0210342) </a>
hierarchy wins.  Small mass
squared differences among nearly degenerate nus are hard to get.
