*** New MINOS Delta msquared_32
</h1> <p>
The world's best value of Delta msquared_32 came from the MINOS
previous analysis of 3.4e20 pot comparing the E of charged
current events in the near and far detectors.  At Nu2010, Patricia
Vahle showed that with 7.2e20 pot, MINOS has 1986 events (expected
2451 if no oscillations).  The shape fit gives Dm^2_32= 2.35 +0.11
-0.08 10^-3 eV^2.  The previous value was 2.43 +- 0.14.  The new
best fit is maximal mixing, and sin^2(2-theta) &gt; 0.91 at 90%CL.

*** ICARUS sees first neutrino event
</h1> <p>
When Theseus left Crete, Minos got mad at Icarus, who then left.
The ICARUS liquid argon detector is being commissioned in the
Cern Neutrino to Gran Sasso (CNGS) beam.  On May 28 19:54 the
first long-baseline neutrino event in liquid argon was seen.
It has a leading muon, two charged tracks undergoing hadronic
interactions, and two photons converting 14 and 16 cm from the
vertex.  They showed three other CNGS neutrinos as well.

*** MiniBooNE antineutrinos seem a bit different
</h1> <p>
In my drive to "Knossos", the site of Minos' alleged Labyrinth,
I saw Greek signs spelling it with two sigmas and spelling it with
three sigmas.  They can't agree whether the site contains a two
sigma effect or a three sigma effect.  MiniBooNE, which previously
showed its neutrino data was inconsistent with a two-neutrino
oscillation interpretation of LSND, updated its antineutrino data
with 5.66e20 pot, and showed an LSND-like excess, E&gt;475 MeV.  The
match to  null is 3%.  It's consistent with LSND at 99.4% relative
to null.  In nus, a 2-nu fit is inconsistent with LSND at 90%CL.

*** MINOS antineutrinos seem a bit different
</h1> <p>
MINOS had previously shown an analysis of antineutrinos using
a neutrino beam.  At Athens, they showed an analysis of 1.71e20
antineutrino running (where negatives are focused in the horn
and positives in the detectors).  The no oscillation prediction
was 155 events and 97 were observed, disfavoring no oscillations
at 6.3 sigma.  Parameter space has poor overlap with neutrinos.
MINOS has requested 2.5e20 more running in antineutrino mode.

</p><h1>
*** MINOS neutral currents
</h1> <p>
In MINOS, the neutral current event rate should not change between
the near detector and far detector with 3-nu oscillations.  An FD
deficit could indicate mixing to sterile nus.  MINOS expects 757
events, observes 802 and sets a limit of 22% (40%) on oscillation
fraction to sterile nus at 90%CL without (with) nue appearance.

*** New MINOS paper on electron appearance
</h1> <p>
The Minoans left great sites for archaeologists, but documentation
was nil, Linear A being undeciphered.  MINOS has documented much,
from Lorentz invariance
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.4945"> arXiv:0806.4945 </a>, to nus
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.2237"> arXiv:0806.2237 </a>,
to seasonal
variations of cosmic rays
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.4012"> arXiv:0909.4012. </a>
A new paper has been
submitted on the search for electron appearance with a new
limit on theta13
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.0996"> arXiv:1006.0996. </a>
The observation is 54 candidate far
detector nu_es with a background of 49.1+/-7.0(stat.)+/-2.7(syst.)
leading to 2sin^2(2theta_{13})sin^2(theta_{23})&lt;0.12 (0.20) at
90% C.L. for the normal (inverted) mass hierarchy at delta_cp=0.

*** Neutrino name origin and destiny in Neutrino 2010 summary talk
</h1> <p>
The legends of Minos et al. arose not from Minoans but Greeks who
came later.  In Lisi's theoretical summary at Nu 2010, he traced the
origin of the word Neutrino.  Fermi's "little neutral one" came
from the Italian Neutro "neutral" from Latin ne-uter "not either"
and uter is from Ionic Greek Koteros (Sanskrit Kataras) "Which of 2"
from Indo-European Ka or Kwa.  Declining "Koteros", he asked:
Which of the two? -  (mass hierarchies)
Which of the three? - (see-saw types, if any)
Which of the many? - (scales of new physics)

*** Theta-13 in Athens
</h1> <p>
There is considerable graffiti on Greek roads, and the most popular
graffiti in Crete is "Theta-13".  Whether it was put there by gate
13 soccer fans or physics hooligans, it was mentioned by many
experimenters and all theorists at Neutrino 2010. Many theorists
showed tri-bimaximal mixing(TBM), and said that theta_13 was zero or
maybe more.  One theorist actually showed a prediction based on
corrections to TBM related to the Cabbibo angle, and said
Ue3 = 0.0583, the first prediction I remember good to 4 digits!

*** ArgoNeuT progress
</h1> <p>
When the Argonauts were going home and passed Crete, a bronze
giant threw rocks at them.  At Athens, Mitch Soderberg showed
the tremendous progress on Liquid Argon Activities in the
past few years at Fermilab, including results from ArgoNeuT
and plans for the Liquid Argon Purity Demonstrator, MicroBooNE
and LBNE.  ArgoNeuT acquired 1.4e20 pot in mostly antineutrino
mode, and saw 5110 CC numu, 5490 CC antinumu, 142 Nue and 4266
Neutral Current.  They'll use data to measure the effectiveness
of dE/dx particle ID and obtain cross section measurements.

*** Stan Wojcicki Fest 14 August 2010
</h1> <p>
Stan Wojcicki led the MINOS experiment for 15 years.  On August 14
there will be an all day symposium at Stanford for his transition
to Professor Emeritus.
