</p><h1>
*** HEPAP </h1>
At the HEPAP meeting on November 18th at SLAC, John O'Fallon
will lead a 15 minute discussion at which he will probably set
up the procedure for a HEPAP sub-panel to study long baseline
issues in the US, in particular a comparison of opportunities
at BNL and FNAL.  Opportunities at CERN and KEK may also be
considered.   HEPAP chairman and interim FNAL spokesman Stan
Wojcicki has asked to not run that part of the meeting, to avoid
the appearance of any conflict of interest.

<p>
</p><h1>*** DPF considers/plans ad-hoc panel on long baseline choices</h1>
In a letter to laboratory directors dated October 5th, DPF
chairman Mike Zeller suggested that the Division of Particles and
Fields of the American Physical Society appoint an ad-hoc panel
to discuss long baseline options in the US.   This was to be
discussed at their executive committee meeting October 14th (the
result of which is not known by me, but I did hear it was
"heated").  The FNAL steering committee sent the opinion that
DPF input was most welcome, but any process which delayed the
comparison beyond the spring would not be welcome.
<p>
</p><h1>*** Chorus/NOMAD extension</h1>
CHORUS ended their first run with about 7 e18 protons
on target on October 2st, which is about 80% of design
intensity.  (Their proposal called for 2.4 e19 pot in 2 years.)
NOMAD has had some broken wire problems in their
first modules, but expect the problem to be all fixed for the
2nd part of the run which will start in April.  "Unofficially",
the necessary moves for an extension to 1996/1997 have been
made; documents will be submitted soon and approval expected in
December.  They'll scan 1 stack of bulk emulsion starting Feb.
<p>

</p><h1>*** CERN to consider long baseline in April</h1>
At the Cogne meeting of the CERN PAC in April, there will be
presentations from two long baseline proponents; Leo Resvanis
from NESTOR will present their long baseline proposal, and Carlo
Rubbia will be presenting the ICARUS proposal.  "The present CERN
planning assumes that most likely the project will go ahead."
The US long baseline collaboration, many of whom were part of
the GENIUS EOI to Gran Sasso, has decided not to pursue a CERN
long baseline experiment as a collaboration.   One wild idea at
CERN is to built a horn aimed between Gran Sasso and Pylos and
bend +'s one way, -'s the other, and switch every so often.
One + note for NESTOR is that Pylos' mayor won re-election.

</p><h1>*** Long Baseline planning at kek in Japan</h1>
Considerable work on a possible long baseline plan for KEK to
Superkamiokande was presented at a workshop.  KEK would like a
proposal for a review panel December 14th to decide 1) whether to
upgrade the PS and 2) the relative merit of K physics/ heavy ion
physics/unstable nuclei/neutrinos.  With a neutrino beam pipe of
200 m, and the PS (upgraded from 4e12  ppp to e13 ppp), one could
expect 500 events at SuperK which is 220 km from KEK; in 4
months.   A detector (off axis) could also be put at 25 km and
see part of the beam.
The project cost was estimated at $40M

</p><h1>*** Panel to consider KEK beam December 14th.</h1>
KEK would like a proposal for a review panel December 14th.
The December review will be part of a
symposium on the "Role of KEK in medium energy physics", 12-15
December.  For information contact

</p><h1>*** FNAL collaboration chooses site;FNAL wants early new detector</h1>
In a letter to John Peoples, the LBC recommended the Soudan
site, subject to concern over the committment by the lab to
prompt construction of the new detector.   John Peoples
answered, "The Lab will forge ahead... and develop plans for the
Soudan site", and also, "Our goal should be to have an
operational beam and detector with a mass greater than 15
kilotons during the year 2000."
<p>

</p><h1>*** LBC developing detector R&amp;D proposals.</h1>
The collaboration has internally received eight R&amp;D funding
requests which are being reviewed by a committee of K. Heller,
D. Michael and D. Ayres, and will work their way through to FNAL.
<p>

</p><h1>*** BNL; DIAL 911 for long baseline</h1>
There was an internal long baseline comparison at BNL on October
24th.  The spark chamber option will be presented at BNL's HENP
PAC on November 3rd at 3:30 as P911 by Ted Kycia.   Rumors say
Cerenkov counters at 20 km remain the preferred option.
<p>

</p><h1>*** UK Long Baseline Meeting </h1>
A long baseline meeting in the UK was held October 19th, and new
individuals from 5 institutions attended and/or showed varying
degrees of interest.   Meanwhile the UK-PPESP gave the Soudan
group a modest increase in travel money, due to the increase in
long baseline meetings which are being held in the US.
<p>

</p><h1>*** Physics Today; Neutrino oscillation in Search &amp; Discovery</h1>
An article about the atmospheric neutrino anomaly and possible
long baseline experiments is in the October 1994 issue of
Physics Today (p22-24).   The article does a good job
summarizing the atmospheric neutrino anomaly, and focuses on the
new zenith angle plot from Kamioka.
