</p><h1>Fermilab neutrino oscillation review</h1>
A committee is prepared to hear neutrino oscillation
proposals on June 9th and 10th, at Fermilab.

<h1>1st 822 collaboration meeting was April 21 at ANL.</h1>
The meeting attracted 36 attendees for the day and
dinner afterwards for many.   Copies of transparencies
are available.  In the morning, discussion focused on
civil construction issues and motivation and politics.
In the afternoon, there was discussion of various
options for cavity filler detectors.   One major outcome
of the meeting is that which detector concept we choose
may be less important, while monte carlo calculations of
energy resolution as a function of plate thickness and
detector granularity may be more important, than we
thought earlier.

<h1>P822 makes front page of Minneapolis Star Tribune</h1>
After the new Scientist report last month, it was
realized that the first reports in the Minnesota press
about our project should be from our point of view.  At
the instigation of Marvin Marshak at the University of
Minnesota, a reporter named Jim Dawson wrote an article
which appeared on the front page of the April 12th, 1993
edition, and (mostly accurately) described the goals of
the experiment.  (One point off for describing a pion
target.)   The touchy issue of radiation effects from
neutrinos was addressed.  Although it's easy to dismiss
the issue as a serious concern, the issue will be often
asked about if the experiment happens.  With that in
mind, it was handled pretty well.

<h1> Visit to DOE in Washington</h1>
822 was part of an expedition to Washington which was
sponsored by the Fermilab Users Group to update the
funding agency on the importance of good support at
Fermilab due to the excellent physics program there.
Half hour talks were given on the beam (Gina Rameika),
the short baseline experiment (Bill Reay), the long
baseline experiment (Maury Goodman) and the muon storage
ring experiment for electron neutrinos (Wonyong Lee).
At the end O'Fallon commented that Fermilab will be
needed in the next century to do these experiments
because everyone won't be at the SSC.

<h1>SSC neutrino meeting at Baton Rouge cancelled</h1>
The meeting scheduled for early May was cancelled due to
a disappointing response.  It may be rescheduled later.

<h1>HEPAP meeting</h1>
At the April HEPAP meeting in Washington, Nick Samios
mentioned the approval of the long baseline project
there, and noted that something like a HEPAP committee
would have to decide between that one and Fermilab.

The answer is no, shooting down Rick Milburn's idea.
