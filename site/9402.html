</p><h1>Science Article on Long Baseline/Short Baseline Neutrinos</h1>
A discussion of various proposed and approved neutrino
oscillation experiments around the world can be found in the
Feb. 18th version of Science Magazine, pp 916-918.  A drawing of
the Soudan beam, and a map of Italy are included.

</p><h1>Snowmass Long Baseline Workshop</h1>
A focus at Snowmass on long baseline neutrino experiments is
being worked on, with Maury Goodman, Doug Michael and Al Mann on
the organizing committee.  One main focus is on long range
planning, which is what Snowmass can accomplish.  The present
plan calls for discussing motivation (i.e. atmospheric neutrinos
and theory) the first week, and experimental program ideas the
second week.  Please plan to come and forward ideas to us.

</p><h1>Solar deficit disfavored at Venice Workshop</h1>
At the Neutrino Telescopes meeting, cold water was put on the
solar nu deficit by Dar.  Theoretical talk by Dar on paper by
himself and Shaviv,submitted to PRL in January. Standard physics
solutions to the solar neutrino problem. An improved solar model
with a more accurate treatment of plasma physics predicts a nu
flux consistent with the 4 (3) experiments.  When atoms are
densely packed in a plasma the nuclear cross sections are
affected. Thus p+Be7--B8 + gamma extrapolations as done earlier
are wrong. Nu Oscillations are a nice idea which God didn't use,
he claims.  Data shown SAGE 74+-19+-10 SNU;
GALLEX 79+-10+7-5 SNU.(new)    All Homestake data and Kamioka
still disagree with each other and with any solar model, but the
later Homestake data agrees better.

</p><h1>KAON officially cancelled</h1>
The Canadian government has officially cancelled the KAON
project at Triumf, solely for cost and funding reasons.  There
is hope that Triumf will get some kind of consolation upgrade,
but this will probably await the appointment of a new director
later this year.   (See KAON paper below)

</p><h1>Long Baseline/822 meeting</h1>
At a meeting on February 20th, the 822 group discussed
calculations we have been working on related to systematic
effects for the March 8th document for the FNAL PAC.
<p>
</p><h1>HEPAP shootout (?)</h1>
In a letter from HEPAP to Martha Krebs, Stan Wojcicki, head of
HEPAP, wrote, "...some key questions in hep today--B physics and
neutrino oscillations are good examples--can be addressed at
several laboratory facilities in this country and also abroad...
(we urge that reviews take place) before major funds are
committed to such initiatives and we urge that this process
begin soon."   Brookhaven has urged that the review be held by
April.  Fermilab people have told me they prefer a review in
the fall.
<p>
</p><h1>Fermilab PAC</h1>
The 872 proposal to observe tau neutrinos in a beam dump with
the Tevatron was well received on February 11th.  Since the
proposal is for the next fixed target run, it is on a fast track
for approval/rejection, probably at the April meeting.   One
idea for a hadron calorimeter in 872 is to use Soudan modules.
