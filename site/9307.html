</p><h1>Soudan 2 data for 1 kt-year presented.</h1>
At Calgary ICRC, Marseilles EPS and Cornell Lepton
Photon Conference the 1 kiloton year atmospheric
neutrino flavor ratio was presented.  It is now
.69 +- .19 (combined) with .59 +- .28  (first 0.5) and
.76 +- .29 (2nd half kt-year).  The Calgary rapporteur,
Paolo Lipari, called the result a highlight of the
conference.  The Marseilles rapporteur, Okun, reported
that he believed the Solar neutrino deficit and not the
atmospheric deficit.  This might be because Baksan
claims to rule out the effect with the upward muon flux,
but that relies on the absolute value of the Butkevich
flux calculation, which Perkins has shown is more
uncertain than has been reported.

<h1>Calgary Workshop on Atmospheric Neutrinos.</h1>
About 80 people attended this workshop.  Besides our
data, it was most interesting that four calculations of
atmospheric neutrino fluxes had been beat against each
other quite a bit since the May Baton Rouge Conference
(Barr/Gaisser/Stanev, Lee and Koh, Bugaev, and Honda)
and that while all four calculations started agreeing on
the neutrino flavor ratio, now other differences were
largely understood.  Also a balloon measurement of the
upper atmosphere mu flux was reported by the MASS
collaboration and agreed (up to a point) with some BGS
calculations.   The absolute value of the flux was 12%
higher than BGS which disfavors the proton decay idea.
Honda suggested that flux calculations which previously
were good to 20% in abs value and 5% in the ratio were
now good to 10% in abs value and 2% in the ratio.  He
seemed to favor the neutrino oscillation hypothesis.
Ideas on attacking the neutrino anomaly were reported by
IMB, Soudan, Icarus, LVD, and Macro.  Baksan, NUSEX and
KGF were represented and Kamioka data was presented.

<h1>An ICARUS proposal was presented to a Gran Sasso </h1>
committee about two months ago.  The proposal called for
50 million swiss francs and scheduled data starting in
'97.  They would be sensitive to p decay to 5 10**33.

<h1>Higher solar neutrino flux reported by Gallex.</h1>
Gallex I which had 15 extractions saw a solar neutrino
flux of 81 +- 18 SNU.  With 6 extractions, Gallex II
gets 97 +- 23.   Some theoretical papers have noted that
independent of solar model, the Homestake and Kamioka
experiments disagreed.  Davis presented a paper SH10.0.2
claiming that Kamioka and Homestake agree well, but I
think the argument involves restricting Homestake to
87-92 data.  In another paper SH10.0.4 Nakatsuka argues
that the Kamioka analysis of the electron angular
distribution fails to take multiple scattering into
account properly, and that Kamioka overestimates their
solar neutrino flux by 12%.

<h1>Fermilab PAC meeting</h1>
At the June PAC meeting, rumour has it that the idea of
a long baseline neutrino experiment was endorsed by the
PAC, though not P822.  There is a document that includes
questions for 822 which we have not seen yet, and we
will try to get it/them this month.

<h1>Injector and Beam drilling progress</h1>
Gordon Koizumi reports that visual inspections of the
Main Injector construction progress are potentially very
valuable to NUMI.  For example, the lowest visible layer
was grey clay and temporary 6-7 foot high vertical walls
appeared very stable.  Meanwhile FESS (the Fermilab
engineering department) has given the green light for
the NUMI core drilling in the Soudan beam line locations,
and this could be done any week.  Byron Lundberg has been
asked by the Fermilab research division to "coordinate an
effort to provide the lab with a cost estimate for civil
construction for a combined long/short baseline experiment."
