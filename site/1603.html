<h1>Long-Baseline news, March 2016 </h1>

*** NOvA nue cross section
</h1> <p>

</a>
NOvA's first cross section measurement studied electron nus in
the near detector.  The small fraction of electron neutrinos in
the beam come from muons and kaons.  The integrated flux uses
external data from NA49 and MIPP to constrain hadron production
uncertainty.  The measured rate is noticeably higher than the
current expectation from GENIE2.8.0 on Carbon 12.

*** T2K resumes antineutrino running
</h1> <p>
T2K has shown numubar to nuebar candidate oscillation events in
antineutrino running from last year, &amp; as of Jan 2016 is  running
again in antineutrino mode.   They can tag the 2.2 MeV gamma from
IBD 20% of the time.  When they run with Gd starting in 2018, they
should be able to tag the IBD events with 100% efficiency,
reducing the substantial neutrino background.

*** First result from Double Chooz (DC) using Near Detector
</h1> <p>
DC has 150 days of Near Detector Livetime, together with 673 days
with the far detector and 7 days of reactor-off data.  Two detector
results suppress systematic errors below 0.4%.  Theta13 is non-
zero with 5.8 sigma confidence.  The best fit for sin^2(2q13) is
0.111 +- 0.018 (stat.+syst) with chi^2/dof=128.8/120.  This is
higher than Daya Bay's value by 30% or 1.4 sigma.  This is
interesting since T2K and NOvA see large appearance signals.

The newest result from Daya Bay using H gets sin^2(2q13) =
0.071 +- 0.011. Combined with Gd: 0.082 +- 0.004.

*** status of JUNO
</h1> <p>
JUNO has approved the use of a double calorimetry system using 36K
3"PMTs to enhance the 18K 20" PMTs.  Combined they will constitute
the largest photocathode density ever built.  The number of hits
in the small PMTs will provide complementary information to the
pulse heights measured in the large PMTs and improve the energy
resolution, a key design objective for JUNO.  As of Jan, 850 m of
the 1450 m of tunnels is complete in the JUNO complex.  Nuclear
reactors are under construction at Yangjiang and Taishan, but
there will be 2 fewer reactors than originally planned.

*** Video Short introduction to DUNE and LBNF on Youtube

is growing constantly, currently with 841 collaborators from 149
institutions in 28 countries.  This 2 minute video says that over
1000 are working on DUNE/LBNF, possibly true if non-collaborators
are included, and certainly true not too long from now.

Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz, testifying at the House Science
Hearing on the DOE 2017 budget, commented, "No bones about it,
LBNF is a high priority project, the highest priority project,
certainly in particle physics."  Subscribe to "FYI" bulletins

*** International Neutrino Summer School (INSS 2016)
</h1> <p>
The 9th INSS will be held in Quy Nhon, Vietnam 18-29 July 2016.
The program is aimed at both experimentalists and theoreticians,
graduate students and early postdocs, and will cover the full
range of topics in nu physics.
<a href="http://vietnam.in2p3.fr/2016/inss/">

The $900 registration fee covers local transportation, room, food.
Deadline 17 May.  Limited funds are available for support.

*** Fermilab 35 ton LAr prototype ends two weeks early
</h1> <p>
The Argon in this small DUNE prototype was contaminated when a
pipe that was transferring gaseous Ar broke near the pump and air
(N2@50ppm, O2@30ppm and H2O@150ppb) contaminated the liquid Argon,
beyond the ability of the filters to remove O2.  The gaseous Ar
was being drawn out of LAPD to raise the liquid Ar level in 35t.
Analysis continues.  Next protoDUNE gets built at CERN.

*** KM3NET chosen for European roadmap
</h1> <p>
The European Strategy Forum for Research Infrastructures announced
KM3NeT was selected for the 2016 ESFRI Roadmap.  KM3NeT's research
infrastructure is planned with deep-sea sites near Toulon, Sicily
and Pylos. The goals are the discovery of astrophysical sources
of cosmic nus, the mass ordering and synergistic research in marine
and environmental studies.  The Roadmap identifies new Research
Infrastructures of pan-European interest corresponding to the
long-term needs of the communities.
