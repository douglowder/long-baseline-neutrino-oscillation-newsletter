*** Neutrino Dedication
</h1>
U.S. speaker of the House Dennis Hastert, together with Minnesota
congressman Jim Oberstar, pushed a button and neutrinos went on
their way from Hastert's district in Illinois towards Oberstar's
at the Soudan mine.  Director of the Office of Science Orbach
used the occasion to say that Fermilab was the premier HEP lab in
the U.S., and he would do what he could to keep it that way.
1000 used the occasion for a big party.  Streaming video:

*** Neutrino events from Fermilab in the MINOS far detector
</h1>
On the last day of a MINOS meeting in mid-March, the first events
at the far detector in conjunction with the beam started to show
up.  The first find was a neutrino induced muon entering the
detector.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrino Pause
</h1>
In its first full month, MINOS has run near its anticipated
intensity and near its design repetition rate.  However, a
cooling water leak has been identified in the graphite target, so
the experiment will be down while it is fixed.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrino Scientific Advisory Group Charge
</h1>
DOE-Nuclear Physics, DOE High Energy and the NSF have asked HEPAP
and NSAC to establish NuSAG (Neutrino Scientific Assessment Group)
for 2 years to address 1.) U.S. participation in a reactor
neutrino experiment; 2.) phased sensitive searches for 0nu double
beta decay; and 3.) accelerator experiments for theta-13.
Mentioned were Diablo Canyon, Braidwood, Double Chooz, Daya Bay,
Majorana, EXO, Cuorcino, Moon, T2K and NOvA.  Alluded to were
KASKA and FLARE.  A report is requested by June 2005.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrino poll
</h1>
The citizens of San Louis Obispo California were asked by the
local newspaper if neutrino research should be allowed at the
Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power plant.  By a margin about 9 to 1,
they said yes.   This week's question is not about neutrinos.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrino mass hierarchy determination
</h1>
Roughly speaking, MINOS will measure delta msquared 32 and Double
Chooz will measure delta msquared 31.  If they could measure them
better, a determination of the mass hierarchy is possible, as
shown in Nunokawa et al.,

*** Neutrinos Main Injector Off-Axis nu Appearance (NOvA)
</h1>
A new version of the NOvA proposal was submitted to Fermilab.

high resolution, or

It calls for a 30 kiloton
detector at 810 km along the NuMI beam.  It would be 16m x 16m x
132m, or 1984 planes of extruded plastic &amp; liquid scintillator.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrino fest
</h1>
A NeutrinoFest will bring together scientists and science
writers to talk about neutrinos on April 18, 2005, at the APS
Tampa meeting.

*** Neutrino comment from new Argonne Director Rosner
</h1>
Neutrino enthusiast Bob Rosner has just been appointed the new
director of Argonne.  At his welcoming reception, he told
long-baseline news he thought that things looked good for a
reactor experiment and for Fermilab's proton driver.
For two weeks MINOS will be featured at

*** MICE funded
</h1>
The Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment at Rutherford, a step on
the way to a neutrino factory, has been funded almost 10 million
pounds.

Apparently monopoles could be used to
measure her brain waves.  But some of it is classified.
