*** First Underwater Neutrino seen by Baikal </h1>
The first clear deep underwater/ice neutrino has been reported by
Baikal with .25 years of operation of their NT-36.  NT-72 is now
installed and NT-200 proposed.  The one muon has four tube hits
and clearly goes up with an excellent fit.  55 million downward
muons have been recorded.  DUMAND has three strings ready for
deployment, but continues to negotiate with the DOE about
ship-time to fix a partial short at the junction box in the
ocean.  AMANDA may reach dust when they get below the bubbles.

*** Gran Sasso Long-Baseline Workshop </h1>
There was a large and enthusiastic turnout for this workshop to
study possible long-baseline experiments at Gran Sasso.  Three
new experiments (below) described what they could see, as well
as Borexino and Macro.  Director Monacelli described the two new
halls that are planned.  Experimental Letter's of Intent are due
December 31st.  Groups that are interested in the physics but
haven't picked a detector technology were invited to send EOI's.

*** ICARUS, NOE and RICH </h1>
The 600 ton first module of ICARUS (Rubbia et al.) is being
built, and should be installed and operating in 4 years.  The
presentation by Rubbia started out showing that the Higgs, though
important, wasn't everything.  He showed solar neutrino and
proton decay capabilities of ICARUS as well as long baseline
discovery limits.  He concluded that neutrino physics needs new
detectors, "Iarocci tubes and 2 cm steel won't tell us what we
want to know." The NOE experiment (Barbarino et al.) is a
calorimeter.  Each calorimeter module .3 x .3 x 8 m^3 is made of
300 fibers and an iron/concrete mix.  Between calorimeters would
be RPC's or streamer tubes.  Four kilotons is envisaged.  RICH
(Ypsilantis et al.) is now planned to be 14-18 kTons of water
(30m diameter x 20 m long) with phototubes followed by a 30 m
RICH filled with C5F12 at 1 bar with a gamma-threshold of 17.
This would give excellent (few percent) momentum resolution for
outgoing muons.  The water tank would identify electrons.

*** Gran Sasso Long Baseline Workshop;  CERN view </h1>
SPS Chairman D'Almagne represented CERN at the Gran Sasso Long
Baseline Workshop.  Although cautioning that resources were limited
and that things take time, he said that CERN engineering for the
transfer tunnel to the LHC was being done in a way to preserve
the option of a beam to Gran Sasso.  The possibility of near
detector cave with access near the airport has been preserved,
and there is no opposition from Switzerland.  The location is
from an industrial zone in Meyrin, and if put right under the
shaft would be 850 m from the dump assuming a 1 km decay pipe.

*** Near Detector for Cern to Gran Sasso? </h1>
When asked if they wanted a near detector, experiment proponents
said they didn't need one because they could see tau appearance.
None really showed that they could with no backgrounds and a full
analysis.   Dydak suggested that building a long baseline
experiment without a near detector was like buying a Porsche and
putting bicycle tires on it.

*** SuperKamiokande dedication </h1>
In early November SuperKamiokande was dedicated with the
appropriate amount of speeches and sake.  The tubes are almost
all in, a test run without water will be in December, and it
WILL turn on in April 96.  The outer US tubes are going well but
are behind the Japanese.  Things are moving swiftly for the
long-baseline experiment;  horns are under construction and the
detector design is essentially frozen.  Much will be used
material from Venus, muon counters and lead glass, with an
active target and the existing water tank.  The 50 GeV machine is
going ahead too, though the initial run will be on the PS in '98.

*** grammar of l-o-n-g-b-a-s-e-l-i-n-e </h1>
The vote favored "long baseline" but those with a reason all said
long-baseline.  When "long baseline" is used as an adjective
(e.g. long-baseline experiment) it should be hyphenated.  When it
is used as a noun, it is not hyphenated.  Baseline is a single
word (cf "baseball!") in this context.  The point, I have now
learned, is that long modifies baseline and not experiment.
Long-baseline News will now attempt to be consistent.
(High-energy physicists and high energy physicists watch out!)

*** MINOS described in Minnesota student newspaper </h1>
MINOS, though it is never named, made the front page of the
November 3, 1995 issue of the University of Minnesota student
daily, "Minnesota Daily".  Minnesota professors Earl Peterson and
Roger Russack describe the experiment.  The story is accompanied
by an incomprehensible graphic labeled "expected change in
signatures of neutrinos" which looks like Morse code.

<p> </p><h1>
*** MINOS meetings </h1>
The next MINOS meeting at Fermilab, December 8-10, will overlap
with the COSMOS meeting, December 8-9, and a joint session is
planned.  MINOS has set aside some time December 8th for new
groups "just looking".  A beam workshop at Nevis is December 4-5.
