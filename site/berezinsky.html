</head><body>Dear Dr. Goodman,
<p> I am afraid that in your quotations, taken out of context and being incomlete,
the meaning of the phrases from my lecture  at 25th ICRC is rather strongly
distorted.

</p><p> My joke about my age and the wish of good health to the young people
was clearly related to the neccessity to distinguish experimentally the three
elementary particle solutions, I discussed. In fact, this joke reflects my
belief that this problem cannot be {\em convincingly} solved at the
detectors of this generation, while construction of new detectors with
the statistics larger than in SuperK is problematic.

</p><p> The short citation about helioseismology is impossible to understand
correctly out of context of my long discussion of seismic data. I
demostrated very high accuracy of confirmation of SSM by seismic data inside
the sun including inner core (unreachable for present solar neutrino
experiments) and in this context I finished with the phrase you quote.
However, my  main message was in the second part of this phrase
"Instead, the solar neutrino experiments will provide us with unique
information about properties of neutrinos".

</p><p> Best regards, V.Berezinsky
