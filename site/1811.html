<H1>Long-Baseline news, November 2018 </H1>
<P> 
Who knew new nu?

<H1>
*** long-baseline pioneer, Ko Nishikawa 1949-2018
</H1> <P>
Koichiro Nishikawa, the founding spokesperson of the K2K and T2K
experiments, passed away on November 28th, 2018. Nishikawa-san was
the pioneer of the accelerator long-baseline neutrino experiments.
He proposed and carried out the world first long-baseline neutrino
oscillation experiment, K2K, that firmly confirmed nu oscillations
discovered in atmospheric neutrinos.  T2K found the first evidence
of nue appearance in the numu beam.  With these scientific
achievements, Nishikawa-san received several awards: Nishina
Memorial Prize,  Breakthrough Prize, and Bruno Pontecorvo Prize.
He was the professor emeritus in KEK, and served as the director
of Institute of Particle and Nuclear Studies, KEK.

*** Large Enriched Ge Experiment for Nu-less 2beta Decay (LEGEND)
</H1> <P>
Building on the successes of the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR and
GERDA, the LEGEND collaboration has been formed to pursue a
ton-scale 76Ge experiment, with discovery potential at a
half-life beyond 10^28 years. See 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00849"> arXiv:1810.00849 </A>

<H1>
*** STRings for Absorption length in Water (STRAW)
</H1> <P>
STRAW is a pathfinder for a deep ocean neutrino telescope in the
Pacific.  It was deployed in June 2018 at 2600 m in the Cascadia
Basin, a site operated by Ocean Networks Canada (ONC).  It will
measure the scattering length and ambient background to determine
suitability for a km^3 detector.

<H1>
*** Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND)
</H1> <P>
This is a planned large-scale observatory for high energy (E >
10^8 GeV) cosmic rays (CR).  It would study radio emission from
extensive air showers in the atmosphere.  It plans 10,000 radio
antennas over 10,000 km^2 in radio-quiet locations.  UHE CR's
have a GZK horizon at 100 Mpc, but nus don't.

<H1>
*** Tritium endpoint study of Cosmic Neutrino Background (CNB)
</H1> <P>
The concept of neutrino capture on beta-decay nuclei to detect the 
CNB was laid out by Weinberg in 1962 and refined by Cocco, Mangano
and Messina in 2007 in view of the finite neutrino mass discovered
by oscillation experiments.  A transverse drift electromagnetic
filter in PTOLEMY studying Tritium decay provides a step toward
the required energy resolution.

<H1>
*** Pyhasalmi mine
</H1> <P>
The Pyhasalmi mine had been chosen as the site for two projects,
LENA and LAGUNA-LBNO that did not go forward.  But it is an
available fresh air underground site at 4100 mwe.  There is the
Experiment with Multi-Muon Array (EMMA) studying the CR mass
composition in the knee region at 75 m depth.  See 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00909"> arXiv:1810.00909 </A>.

<H1>
*** Is a Monkee knee high to a muon neutrino?
</H1> <P>
Monkee singer and drummer Micky Dolenz says that he was once.

*** SBND Anode Plane Assembly (APA) Time lapse video
</H1> <P>
See 
<A href="https://youtu.be/pAAhEiXuS2c">https://youtu.be/pAAhEiXuS2c 
  </A>
to see a start-to-finish wiring
of an APA at Yale Wright Lab for the Short-Baseline Nu Detector.

<H1>
*** ProtoDUNE-SP finishes beam running
</H1> <P>
Beam running from 0.3-7.0 GeV with pi, proton, e+ & K events at
each momentum has concluded.  A proposal about further running of
ProtoDUNE-SP and -DP after CERN's long shutdown 2 has been
submitted to CERN.

<H1>
*** NOvA shifts chosen by Monte Carlo
</H1> <P>
Two years ago at NOvA shift sign up time, all shifts were taken
and some people didn't get any.  I never understood why this was a
problem,  A new system was put in place where everyone selects
preferences & a computer algorithm assigns shifts.  The algorithm
is chaotic in that it is sensitive to a random number seed.  It
is run for 10^6 random seeds and the best solution is based on a
“chi squared” using quotas and preferences.  This time there were
two best solutions, the 1st one being the 113947th seed.
