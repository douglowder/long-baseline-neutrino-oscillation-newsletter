*** Borexino deals with seals
</h1>
The Borexino detector at Gran Sasso is now installing the nested 
nylon scintillator containment vessels, and expects to begin the 
inflation and water filling process this summer. However, 
following a small (~50kg) accidental pseudocumene discharge last 
August, the experiment has since been prevented from performing 
needed scintillator purification tests.   Due to environmental
safety concerns with the laboratory's infrastructure, part of the
Borexino experiment is currently under police seals.  While the 
experiment has been able to finish ancillary construction, it will
not be able to fill with scintillator until operating 
authorizations have been received from local authorities, and the 
investigating tribunal has removed the seals.  Efforts to address 
the concerns of all parties and accomplish this are being 
vigorously pursued.  On May 29th, Hall C at Gran Sasso was
sealed by local authorities.  The implications are not clear.

*** Minerva
</h1>
or Main INjector ExpeRiment V-A.  This collaboration wants to
construct an off-axis near detector to measure neutrino cross 
sections on nuclear targets in the Few GeV Region with NuMI.

<p> <h1>
*** Finese
</h1>
Fermilab Intense Neutrino Scattering Experiment.  This is a 
proposal for a 10 ton detector 100 meters from the Booster source 
to measure the strange quark contribution to the nucleon spin.

<p> <h1>
*** MINOS at 99%
</h1>
The last MINOS plane will be/was installed June 2 or May 29.
The 2nd coil is scheduled to be powered for magnetized
operations in July.

<p> <h1>
*** MiniBooNE rates up
</h1>
MiniBooNE is up to half of its design intensity, a large recent 
improvement.  Further improvements are coming with a collimator 
project and large-aperture RF cavities for the Booster.  They
have a pizero peak with minimal cuts, and a 23 MeV fitted width.  
With .73 10^20 pot (7% of goal) they have 80355 nus.

*** JHF2K or JHFnu or JPARC2K or JPARCnu or ...
</h1>
On March 22, the first meeting of the Nuclear and Particle
Physics Facility Committee (NPFC) was held at KEK.  A detailed 
presentation of the neutrino LOI (whatever it will be called) was 
heard.  The committee evaluated its scientific significance as 
very high and endorsed its early realization.

*** Fitting KamLAND 
</h1>
Alexei Smirnov pointed out that many people were analyzing solar 
data with KamLAND for mixing angle and mass.  He noticed that 
even if you do something wrong, you get the same answer.

*** Experiments and transparencies
</h1>
Links to the experiments above can all be found at the neutrino 
oscillation industry web page 
<a href="http://www.neutrinooscillation.org/"> 
http://www.neutrinooscillation.org/ </a>
Many meetings post transparencies, and a direct link from the 
meetings page can be found to transparencies for 13 of the 17 
previous neutrino meetings listed for 2003.

*** A table top long-baseline experiment; NOSTROS
</h1>
In 
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0303045"> hep-ex/0303045 </a>
is an idea for NOSTROS (Neutrino OScillation Tritium 
Outgoing Source). Put 20 kgrams of Tritium in a 10 meter radius 
spherical gaseous Xenon detector with 1 bar pressure.  (ok, its a 
big table.)  Threshold neutrino energy of 200 eV for average 14 keV.  
There is sensitivity to theta_13 at the atmospheric delta m^2.

<p> <h1>
*** GADZOOKS
</h1>
Only Mark Vagins could think up "Gadolinium Antineutrino Detector 
Zealously Outperforming Old Kamiokande Super".  Add 100 tons of 
GdCl3 to Super-K and you can separate 16-O neutral current events
from nu_e 16O --> e- F; providing a measure of burst temperature 
and oscillation angle.  Some study is required first.

*** New Yorker profiles Columbia's Janet Conrad
</h1>
Skip "Gertrude Stein's War" in the June 2nd New Yorker Magazine 
to get to a profile by K.C. Cole of MiniBooNE Cospokesman Janet Conrad.  
"If Conrad's experiment confirms her suspicions, she will show that 
a particle that was barely believed to exist can carry enough 
weight to determine the drape of galaxies."

*** Neutrinos versus the bomb
</h1>
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0305062"> Hep-ph/0305062 </a>
by Sugawara et al. is called "Destruction of 
Nuclear Bombs Using Ultra-High Energy Neutrino Beam".  Aim a 1000 
TeV neutrino beam at nuclear weapons, and the neutrino radiation 
hot spot will induce enough fissions for the bomb to destroy 
itself.  More research on neutrino factories is needed first.
