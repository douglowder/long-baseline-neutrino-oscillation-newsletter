	<!-- START LEAD --> In the annals of congressional pork, the sweetheart deal engineered late last month by Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle for a mining company in his home state of South Dakota is relatively small--more like a pork chop. It's Daschle's hypocrisy and double-talk that ought to gall the taxpayers.<BR><BR> Hours before Congress adjourned on Dec. 20, it approved a defense appropriation bill for 2002 that included an unrelated amendment, crafted by Daschle, to protect South Dakota's Homestake Mining, which is shutting down, from any liability for environmental damage caused by its 125 years of operations.<BR><BR> <!-- END LEAD --> <!-- START REST --> Under current federal Superfund regulations, owners of toxic waste sites can be held liable for the costs of clean-up. But thanks to the Daschle amendment, the taxpayers will pick up Homestake's clean-up cost, as well as assume liability for any related lawsuits.<BR><BR> As The New York Times reported Thursday, the federal government is considering building an underground physics laboratory in one of the mine shafts, 7,400 feet inside the earth. Homestake said it would not turn over part of the shuttered mine site unless the feds assumed liability and the clean-up costs.<BR><BR> There are at least three problems with the Daschle amendment. Pork-barrel appropriations usually build something for local residents--a road, a school or a bridge--but in this case the taxpayers will merely get stuck with the cost of cleaning up someone's toxic mess.<BR><BR> Though one environmental group put the cost from $30 million to $40 million, no one really knows what the final tab will be. Exposed to rain and the elements, the earth in and around the mine's 500 miles of tunnels turns acidic, in addition to the cyanide contamination created during the extraction of the gold. The cost of pumping and treating this contaminated pool of water could well go on forever.<BR><BR> Third, Daschle's stealth amendment also pollutes the National Science Foundation's decision-making process for siting the laboratory. Whatever flexibility NSF had is now gone, in a case of science being overrun by politics.<BR><BR> On second thought, make that four problems: The last and most glaring one is his hypocrisy.<BR><BR> Daschle and the Democrats have argued strenuously in favor of environmental protections and against limitations on liability for private corporations. What's more, one of the partisan disagreements that stalled passage of an economic stimulus package stemmed from the objection by Daschle and the Democrats that Republicans were being overly generous to corporations. Apparently they had just picked the wrong corporations.<BR><BR> Daschle wants to shield a profitable mining company from tens of millions in potential liability, to pave the way for a science lab that will create an estimated 200 jobs in western South Dakota.<BR><BR> Economically hard-hit South Dakota needs help. But Daschle's way of providing it stinks as much as the mining site taxpayers will now have to clean up.<BR><BR> <!-- END REST -->
