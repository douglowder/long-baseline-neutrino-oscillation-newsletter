*** EOI for Neutrino Factory submitted to NSF
</h1>An Expression of Interest for a Neutrino Factory Based On a Muon
Storage Ring was submitted to the National Science Foundation by
the Neutrino Factory and Muon Collider Collaboration on 11/1/99.

*** Ultimate Neutrino Page moves across Finland
</h1>Juha Peltoniemi's popular "ultimate neutrino page" has moved with
him from Helsinki to Oulu.  It can now be found at
<a href="http://cupp.oulu.fi/neutrino/">

*** Nu Oscillation Industry, Long-Baseline News Web pages move
</h1>On 11/2 these web pages moved physically, but kept the same
addresses.  However, they have moved from a computer which is
case insensitive to one that is case sensitive.  All new URL's
are completely lower case!  I know that I have been sloppy about
this in the past.

*** MINOS growing
</h1>In the last year, MINOS has grown with groups from Wisconsin,
Pittsburgh, Northwestern, Elmhurst, BNL, Chicago, James Madison,
Athens and South Carolina.   Despite the large number of
neutrinos expected, the people will be limited to 6 Billion.

<p> </p><h1>
*** AquaRICH now for atmospheric nus and possibly pdk.
</h1>AquaRICH, once an NGS long-baseline proposal, is now concentrating on
a large water detector (about 1 Mt) either in a deep pit (for
atmospheric alone) or the sea (for atmospheric and proton decay).
They are building and instrumenting an 8 m diameter prototype with 50
HPD's of 10" diameter each with 2048 pixels. They already have made
5" and 10" HPDs (with 2048 pixels) and are embarking to make 20"
and 40" versions (with 512 pixels).

<p> </p><h1>
*** Oak Ridge's ORLanD project changes name, keeps acronym
</h1>Despite a cut, Oak Ridge's SNS got some funding.  The proposed
LSND-like neutrino oscillation experiment, ORLanD has changed its
focus from an experiment to a facility.  They changed their name
from Oak Ridge Large Neutrino Detector to Oak Ridge Lab for
Neutrino Detectors.  The plan calls for building a laboratory
which could house up to 4 200 ton detectors.  Frank Avignone is
the spokesman for this effort.  The 2 Megawatt source will create
1.4 10^16 neutrinos per second.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Solar "LOW" region can be addressed by day/night, seasonal
</h1>Fogli, Lisi, Montanino, Palazzo (below) show that the so-called
``LOW'' MSW  solution to the solar nu problem can not only be
tested through night-day rate variations in BOREXINO, but also
through seasonal variations in GNO. The net winter-summer
difference (6 months averages, eccentricity effects removed)
amounts to 4--6 SNU in GNO, within the LOW region.

<p> </p><h1>
*** NuMI to get hosed
</h1>The MINOS collaboration endorsed the idea of a "hadronic hose", a
current carrying wire down the center of the decay pipe to focus
more hadrons in the direction of the detectors.  The device,
proposed and designed by Jim Hylen, will increase the flux and
reduce possible systematic errors due to near/far differences.

<p> </p><h1>
*** NuMI might get plugged
</h1>The NuMI beam group is considering a 1.5 meter graphite plug just
after the 2nd horn.  Initial simulations show that this would
reduce the high energy tail by more than a factor of 3 on the low
energy beam without reducing the peak intensity much (10%).

<p> </p><h1>
*** NuMI costs and possible delay
</h1>The NuMI tunnels and Halls project received 6 proposals on 10/26.
Prices are confidential, but presumably above the engineer's
estimate of $24.9M.  The project will proceed after discussion on
scope and contingency utilitization, but the $25M figure
represents the threshold that kicks in yet another review, likely
to delay the project start at least 2 months from Jan 00.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrino lobby prevails in US Senate
</h1>The Senate rejected the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) so
that neutrino physicists could propose neutrino oscillation
experiments using nuclear weapons.  Physicists prefer to do these
experiments with a long-baseline than with a short-baseline.
Bombs are a prolific source of neutrinos, but the detection of
nus from nuclear weapons does not appear in the literature.
