*** LAGUNA Long-Baseline Neutrino Oscillation Proposal
</H1> <P>
Since 2008, LAGUNA has studied large underground labs in Europe.  
The next challenge is to understand the costs of the detectors, in 
order to make a choice.  This includes design work for 3 options, 
(scintillator, H20, Ar), the underground assembly, and operational 
costs.  The LAGUNA-LBNO proposal will be submitted to the next FP7 
infrastructure call DS 2011 (25 Nov 2010).  A tentative structure:
<br> - Management, Outreach, International relations
<br> - Detector Design - Costs including Underground Construction and 
Assessment of Large Detector Magnetization
<br> - Detector Operation, Safety and Risks - Costs including Lifetime 
Operation and Large Volume Liquid Processes
<br> - Long-Baseline Neutrino Beams to LAGUNA - Neutrino Beam Designs 
and Near Detector Concepts
<br> - Underground Science and Physics Potential
<br> At Neu2012 at CERN the idea to send a nu beam to a LAGUNA site was 
seen by the community as an "interesting possibility" (see

Participation in preparing the proposal is invited.  Next meeting
at CERN is Monday 22 Nov 14:30(CET).  contact Andre Rubbia

*** T2K chooses logo
</H1> <P>
At ICHEP, T2K reported 33 neutrino events observed by Super-K from
3.23e19 POT, in which 23 satisfy cuts.  Beam operation with higher
power than 100kW starts mid November.  A vote of all T2K members
chose a new logo:

*** Double Chooz filling
</H1> <P>

The liquid filling of the Double Chooz far detector is underway.
Concentric volumes are the outer veto with scintillator, the buffer
with mineral oil, the gamma catcher with scintillator, and the
target region with Gd loaded scintillator.  The filling has reached
the bottom of the target.  Target filling involves four liquids at
the same time.  

<H1>
*** NOvA filling
</H1> <P>
Filling of the NOvA Integration Prototype Near Detector (IPND) is 
now complete.  This was quickly followed by the readout of the 
first cosmic ray muon tracks from the detector.  The IPND provides 
an early deployment of the NOvA near detector at surface level, 
and a rehearsal for upcoming NOvA far detector integration.  Later
this Near Detector on the Surface (NDOS) will be moved underground
to the same off-axis angle as the NOvA far detector.

*** MicroBooNE won't use MiniBooNE's building
</H1> <P>
Fermilab decided to build a new building for the MicroBooNE
detector, allowing the possibility of continued running for
MiniBooNE.  Meanwhile, MiniBooNE's possible oscillation signal
with antineutrinos is available on the

*** The Indian Neutrino Observatory gets green approval
</H1> <P>
INO suffered a 2 year delay when the previous site at Singara was 
rejected.  An alternative site in the Bodi Hills of Tamil Nadu has 
now received approval from the Ministry of Environment and and 
Forests.  The project involves drilling a 2.1 km tunnel and 
building a lab for a 50 kton iron calorimeter with RPCs to study 
atmospheric, and possibly long-baseline neutrinos.

*** Bimagic baseline is 2540
</H1> <P>
The baseline 7500 km is considered "magic" because the effects of 
CP violation cancel for both hierarchies and effects of the mass 
hierarchy are maximized, for all neutrino energies.  In contrast,
at 2540 km, the oscillation is independent of CP in certain energy 
ranges, around 3.3 GeV for inverted hierarchy and 1.9 GeV for the 
normal hierarchy.  The implications are studied in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1011.1146"> arXiv:1011:1146 
</A>
for Superbeams and 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1009.1093"> arXiv:1009.1093 </A>
for Neutrino Factories.  This 
distance matches BNL-DUSEL or CERN-Pyhasalmi.  Since nobody knows 
what tri-bimaximal means, but it is now in our lexicon, "bimagic" 
works just as well.

*** Saclay Workshop "Le neutrino dans tous ses ï¿½tats" 19 Nov 
</H1> <P>
A one-day workshop dedicated to the memory of neutrino physicist 
Jacques Bouchez (Bugey, Nomad, T2K0 is being organized at the 
Claude Bloch auditorium, located in l'Orme des Merisiers, "easily" 
accessible for non-CEA participants.

*** MINOS/NuMI running antineutrinos again
</H1> <P>
Although the plan was to run neutrinos for the rest of the year,
the NuMI beam was off for the last few weeks to replace the 
target which had a water leak and a helium leak.  That was done
and the beam is back up on 1 November running antineutrinos
for MINOS and MINERvA.
