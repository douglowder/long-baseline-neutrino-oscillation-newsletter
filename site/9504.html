*** Fermilab Long-Baseline Experiment Stage 1 approval
</h1>
After Fermilab PAC presentations on April 28th, MINOS got a letter
from John Peoples saying "The Committee has recommended that I
grant Stage I approval to P-875, and I am pleased to accept that
recommendation".  Later on it says "Congratulations to you and the
MINOS collaboration for having passed this important milestone.
You should be pleased at this recognition of your group's efforts".
The first Letter of Intent for a neutrino beam from Fermilab to
Soudan was in October of 1990.  Main Injector beam is expected
around 2000 so there has been no real delay.

*** NuMI and MINOS budgets </h1>
The Fermilab neutrino beam group has taken the present beam design
and recosted it with a view towards "value engineering" and "value
physics".  Although a deeper beam profile is being used (akin
to Rev 0 which was $46M, rather than Rev 1 which was $35M),
service areas and shafts have been made considerably smaller.
This leads to a civil construction cost estimate of $30.0M,
including contingency, EDIA, and contractors OH&amp;P.  The cost
figures are being reviewed for the design report which will be
available May 15th.  The technical components of the beam have
been calculated at $5.5M, which includes about $1M for the narrow
band beam.  Using firmer estimates for steel costs, the MINOS
detector estimate has been reduced from $55.6M to $50.0M.

</p><h1>
*** G&amp;A/Overhead rules </h1>
New DOE rules say that national labs should include overhead in
construction projects.  Each lab must develop and defend its own
accounting rules.   Fermilab is developing rules that would
apply a range of 9% to 40% depending on the impact on the lab.
As a comparison, the Fermilab Main Injector is being built under
the old rules with only 0.7% overhead in its budget.

*** LSND preprints </h1>
Two preprints about LSND data have appeared.  The official version
is submitted to PRL. The oscillation probability went down from
the talks because they decided to eliminate 2 cuts (the "hot spot"
cut and the early charge cut). If the "hot spot" cut is applied,
P goes from 0.34% to 0.46%.  Bottom line is 9 events with an
expected background of 2.1+-0.3.  A report on a thesis in progress
by James Hill from Penn. yields 5 events with a background of 6.2
(same data, different analysis), and an upper limit on P of .3%.

</p><h1>
*** Fermilab short-baseline dubbed COSMOS </h1>
E-803 has adopted the name COSMOS with the acronym
COsmologically Significant Mass Oscillation Search.  This is the first
experiment which is significant before they have any data.
On their march towards stage 2 approval, there was a director's
review  including a cost review on April 17th.  They did very
well.

</p><h1>
*** Oscillations Subpanel concerned about atmospheric neutrinos </h1>
The Sciulli subpanel is reportedly concerned about the significance
or lack thereof for the reported atmospheric neutrino anomaly.  They
are meeting again May 4th to discuss this and other issues.  They
will meet at Fermilab on June 13-15 and Brookhaven June 20-22 to
hear about proposed programs.  They will also conduct a ``Lehman
Budget Review" in order to compare costs for Brookhaven and
FNAL Longbaseline using the same accounting rules.  The following
seemingly inconsistent statements are all true:
<h3> -Fermilab long baseline is cheaper </h3>
<h3>  -Fermilab and Brookhaven long baseline are the same price</h3>
<h3>  -Brookhaven long baseline is cheaper </h3>
Sorting out these three statements is a mixture of physics and
accounting, however.  (Write for details.)
