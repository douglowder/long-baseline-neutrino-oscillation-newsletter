*** Virtual Neutrino 2020 great success
</H1> <P>
Neutrino 2020, originally scheduled for downtown Chicago with an
estimate of 800 participants, took place online with (halfway
through) 4260 registrants.  That dwarfs the 2476 current
subscribers to this newsletter.  Registration was open to the
public.  Future meeting organizers will have to gauge the relative
value and costs of remote, in-person and hybrid meetings.  Popular 
features were the Slack channel for questions and comments, and
virtual reality rooms.  Slides and videos are available at

Thanks to organizers Sam Zeller, Marvin Marshak & Stephen Brice!

*** New at Nu2020 - Final three-flavor results from MINOS/MINOS+
</H1> <P>
Final results on neutrino mixing parameters from MINOS and
MINOS+ were presented at Nu2020 and in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15208"> arXiv:2006.15208 </A>.
 (It was
for MINOS that this newsletter started in May 1992.) With 21e20
protons on target and 61 kt-yr of atmospheric neutrinos, it
reports Dm^2_32 = 2.40+0.08-0.09 (2.45+0.07-0.08) 10^(-3) eV^2
and sin^2(2q_23) = 0.43+0.20-0.04 (0.42+0.07-0.03) at 68%CL for
the normal (inverted) neutrino mass order.

<H1>
*** New at Nu2020 - Solar cycle CNO neutrinos seen for first time
</H1> <P>
Borexino presented the first evidence for solar CNO neutrinos at
Nu2020 and in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15115"> arXiv:2006.15115 </A>.
This process, whose nus were previously
unmeasured, is expected to provide 1% of the sun's energy, with a
theoretical uncertainty of 28%.  The measured flux of CNO nus was
7.0 +3-2 e8 cm^-2 s^-1.  To establish the signal, control of
backgrounds from Bismuth were needed: best fit 7.2 cpd/100 ton.

<H1>
*** New at Nu2020 - supernova relic neutrino limit from Super-K
</H1> <P>
At Neutrino 2020, Super-K provided a new limit on the flux of
supernova neutrinos from the sum of all previous supernovae in the
universe of < 2.7 cm^-2/s (90%CL) for E > 16 MeV.  There were many
new limits presented, but this one is notable because the model
prediction of 1.7 cm^-2/s is within a factor of two.  It is also
called Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background, but we need a signal
before it can become a background.  See nu2020 poster 231.  This
result will improve when SK starts running with Gd.  The addition
of Gd to Super-K, which will tag neutrons, just started.

<H1>
*** Planning for U.S. particle physics strategy - neutrinos
</H1> <P>
The 2021 "Snowmass" process for defining the future of HEP in the
US includes a nu group - 
<A href="https://snowmass21.org/neutrino/start.">
https://snowmass21.org/neutrino/start.
</A>
A neutrino town hall will take place 9 to noon US Central time on
17 July.  Registration had a nominal deadline of 6 July.

<H1>
*** European particle physics strategy - neutrinos
</H1> <P>
An update to the European Strategy on particle physics says that
Europe should continue to support nu projects in Japan and the US. 
In particular, they should continue to collaborate with  partners
towards the successful implementation of LBNF and DUNE.

*** Underground construction of DUNE area begins
</H1> <P>
On 23 June, the first blast took place 3650 feet below the surface
at the Sanford Underground Research Facility.  3000 tons of rock
will be removed to place a drill, which will be used to remove the
800,000 tons of rock at the 4650 level.

<H1>
*** DUNE papers
</H1> <P>
The physics potential of DUNE, as detailed in the TDR, is being
provided in several publication-quality papers which are starting
to appear in the arXiv.  
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16043"> arXiv:2006.16043  </A>
covers the long-baseline
physics potential.  There's a paper on CVN in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15052"> arXiv:2006.15052.
 </A>
Papers will come soon on Supernova nus, nucleon decay/beyond-SM
physics, and ProtoDUNE.

*** Xenon1T observes excess of low-energy electrons
</H1> <P>
The Xenon1T dark matter experiment 
(<A href="http://www.xenon1t.org/">
http://www.xenon1t.org/</A>) sees
an excess of electrons below 5 keV in 227 days of data.  It might
be a background but more interesting hypotheses include solar
axions or nu magnetic moment.  They both give good fits, but with
parameters in tension with other observations.

*** Comments on Neutrino-4 reactor-based sterile nu "signal"
</H1> <P>
The results of Neutrino-4 in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05301"> arXiv:2005.05301 </A>
finding a 7 eV sterile nu
were the subject of skepticism in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13147"> arXiv:2006.13147 </A>
The authors
of that preprint describe aspects of both the data and analysis
method that might lead to an oscillation signature arising from a
null experiment.  Neutrino-4 answers in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13639"> arXiv:2006.13639 </A>.
