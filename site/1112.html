*** Intense Discussions at the Intensity Frontier Workshop
</H1> <P>
This high attendance meeting started out with a theorist who was 
less interested in neutrino CP violation than other things.  But 
most at the meeting disagreed, and a program for high intensity 
physics in the US centered on neutrinos was laid out.  It was 
capped by Andre De Gouvea.s talk on opportunities with neutrinos.

Jim Siegrist ended the meeting with the schedule for the report, 
and noting that we will implement the currently envisioned program, 
Mu2e, LBNE ..., and the words, "Go forth and do good!"

*** Does a 125 GeV Higgs couple to Neutrinos?
</H1> <P>
Maybe the Higgs has been discovered at about 125 GeV.  Could nus 
get their masses from the Higgs mechanism like all the charged 
fermions?   Neutrinos couple to some Higgs field, which may or may 
not be the same one that gives all charged fermions masses.  
Neutrinos could couple to the same Higgs field in the same way.  
It does imply the existence of right-handed neutrino fields, 
otherwise the left-handed neutrino fields cannot couple to the 
Higgs condensate.  This does not seem like a big change to the 
Standard Model particle content. But right-handed nus are gauge 
singlets, which means they are allowed to have masses independent 
from the left-handed neutrinos, and independent from the Higgs. 
"Anything that is allowed is mandatory." We expect these right-
handed neutrino Majorana masses to exist and, since they have 
nothing to do with the Higgs, we have no idea what their values 
are. By combining the neutrino-Higgs interaction with the right-
handed neutrino Majorana masses, we end up with all neutrinos as 
massive Majorana fermions.   

<H1>
*** The $\nu$ Standard Model
</H1> <P>
We have a new Standard model with Dirac or Majorana masses, but we 
don't know what it is yet.  Right-handed neutrinos may not have 
their own mass parameters. In this case the neutrinos end up as 
Dirac fermions. If these right-handed neutrino masses are not 
present, they must not be allowed. In order for that to be the 
case, there must be some new symmetry we either did not know about 
or that we thought was only accidental. One example of the latter 
is lepton number. If neutrinos turn out to be massive Dirac 
fermions, we will have learned something we do not know today.   
For the scenario where all the neutrinos are Majorana, a curious 
thing happens regarding couplings of neutrinos to the Higgs boson.  
All charged fermions couple diagonally to the Higgs boson (b-bar{b} 
or s-bar{s}, but not bbar{s}), and the coupling is proportional to 
the mass.  But for massive neutrinos, the Higgs can decay to nu_1 
nu_1, nu_1 nu_2, nu_3 nu_4, etc in all kinds of off-diagonal ways. 
The couplings are also proportional to elements of the PMNS matrix.

*** LBNE technology recommendation
</H1> <P>
The Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment, a proposed new beamline
from Fermilab to SURF in South Dakota, has done R&D on two possible
technology options, water Cherenkov and liquid Argon.  In December,
the executive committee recommended to the project manager that a
water Cherenkov detector be built for the far detector.  The 
Project will make a decision in consultation with Fermilab
management and the DOE.  Then on to a CDR and CD1 reviews.

*** Interim design report on a Neutrino Factory
</H1> <P>
The IDS-NF mandate is to deliver the Reference Design Report (RDR) 
for the facility on the timescale of 2012/13. In addition, the 
mandate for the study requires an Interim Design Report to be 
delivered midway through the project as a step on the way to the 
RDR. This document, the IDR, has two functions: it marks the point 
in the IDS-NF at which the emphasis turns to the engineering 
studies required to deliver the RDR and it documents baseline 
concepts for the accelerator complex, the neutrino detectors, and 
the instrumentation systems.

*** LSND backgrounds?
</H1> <P>
The LSND experiment, which either did or didn't see neutrino 
oscillations, and was or wasn't definitively tested by MiniBooNE,
is the subject of some papers calculating the backgrounds using
HARP data.  The backgrounds either are or aren't calculated
correctly.

*** Big Bang theory
</H1> <P>
If you google "Big Bang theory", the first link is to a TV show I 
had never seen, till I was told the 8 Dec show "The Speckerman
recurrence" had whiteboards with recent results from Double Chooz.
<A href="http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_bang_theory/"> 
http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_bang_theory/  </A>
Despite possibly
learning something new about neutrinos, I think I will skip
future episodes, since I can't stand TV shows with a laugh track.

*** Neutrino mass from cosmology
</H1> <P>
Cosmological measurements may soon have significant things to say
about the overall neutrino mass scale.  Careful readers of this
newsletter have probably noticed that this does not get the 
attention it deserves.  This is due to my incomplete understanding
of the issues, and not any lack of appreciation.
