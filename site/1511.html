*** 2016 "Breakthrough Prize" for 5 Neutrino Experiments
</h1> <p>
1300 Physicists from Daya Bay, K2K/T2K, KamLAND, SNO and Super-
Kamiokande won the Prize
<a href="https://breakthroughprize.org/News/29&quot;&quot;">  https://breakthroughprize.org/News/29
</a>
for collectively discovering &amp; measuring nu oscillations.  Naming
all members of the collaboration for a prize is a departure from
the way science prizes are traditionally awarded, and was done
rather deliberately by the committee.  Sergey Brin of Google, Anne
Wojcicki of the genetics company 23andme, Jack Ma of Alibaba and
his wife, Cathy Zhang, Yuri Milner, an entrepreneur and venture
capitalist who founded the awards, and his wife, Julia Milner, and
Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, oversee the awards.

*** LBNF/DUNE gets "Finding of No Significant Impact"
</h1> <p>
A DOE environmental study has determined that building &amp; operating
the proposed Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility and DUNE will not
have a significant impact on the environment.  DOE is following
the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, which requires that
the environmental impacts of any federal project must be studied.
DOE explored potential impacts in the Environmental Assessment
(EA), including impacts on people and the environment, from
building and operating the research machine. Impact to floodplains
&amp; wetlands were considered.

*** Who named the neutronino as the neutrino?
</h1> <p>
I once heard that Fermi had named the neutrino, so I repeated it
as fact in my last newsletter.  That's what underpaid journalists
do.  Luckily, readers correct me when the partial truth is
incomplete.  Pauli had called his particle a neutron.  But to
distinguish it from Chadwick's neutron, it needed a diminutive.
In Italian, that would have been neutronino.  The name was
pronounced for the first time by Edoardo Amaldi, as he wrote in
his 1984 very long and detailed Physics Report (Volume 111) in
note 277:  "The name neutrino, (a funny and grammatically
incorrect contraction of "little neutron" in Italian: neutronino)
entered the international terminology through Fermi, who
started to use it sometime between the conference in Paris in July
1932 and the Solvay Conference October 1933 where Pauli used it.
the word came out in a humorous conversation at the Instituto di
Via Panisperna.  Fermi, Amaldi and and few others were present and
Fermi was explaining Pauli's hypothesis about his "light neutron".
For distinguishing this particle from the Chadwick neutron, Amaldi
jokingly used this funny name, - says Occhialini, who recalls of
having shortly later told around this little story in Cambridge."

*** Can neutrinos justify psychics?
</h1> <p>
In a November episode of the TV show "Bones", a character tried to
use the existence of neutrinos to argue in favor of scientists
'keeping an open mind' about psychics.  She said "For generations,
physicists have believed that nothing could go as fast as light,
but now they've discovered neutrinos," and then she said "the
impossible becomes reality all the time."  I am reminded of Bob
Park's description about phone psychics being replaced by web
psychics; "They didn't see it coming."

*** Citing the GENIE manual and reference
</h1> <p>
The manual for the GENIE neutrino simulation is on the arXiv at
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05494"> arXiv:1510.05494 </a>.
The primary reference for GENIE is the Feb 2010 NIM
paper V614 p87. Only cite the user manual (in addition to NIM)
if work depends on a feature of GENIE that is only documented
there-in (reweighing/systematics, flux/geometry drivers and
experimental interfaces, specialized event generation apps for
specific experiments, atmospheric neutrinos, nucleon decay etc).

*** The MOMENT to search for CP violation</a>
</h1> <p>
M. Blennow et al. write about a proposed MuOn decay MEdium-baseline NeuTrino
beam that would operate with neutrinos from muon decay to study CP
violation.  The idea is based on a Gd-doped water detector proposed
by Cao et al. [<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.8125"> arXiv:1401.8125
</a>
]
and
requires 80% charge identification.

*** At 1 meter is it a long-baseline or short-baseline experiment?
</h1> <p>
Prospects for a sterile neutrino oscillation search using nu-N
coherent scattering at 10-100 eV recoil threshold Si/Ge detectors
is given in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02834"> arXiv:1511.02834. </a>
This would be as near as 1 meter
from a reactor core and sensitivities to 1 eV^2 at 0.01 amplitude.

*** Conceptual Design Report for IsoDAR@KamLAND
</h1> <p>
This idea uses an ion source and inverse beta decay for sterile
neutrino and elastic scattering for NSI searches.

Within a Lambda-CDM
model, they get an upper limit of 110 meV for the nu mass sum.
This disfavors the inverted mass hierarchy and favors the normal.
Also, X. Zhang in
