*** CAPTAIN to measure neutrons in Ar for supernova nu physics
</H1> <P>
"Captain", "chieftain" and "chef" are all the same french word 
borrowed by English centuries apart, and trace the diabolical 
evolution of French pronunciation k/ch/sh.  Now CAPTAIN is a 
liquid argon cryostat being built at Los Alamos, a portable and 
evacuable cryostat holding 5 tons of liquid Ar with a 2,000 
channel TPC and a photon detection system.  CAPTAIN will be moved 
to a high-energy neutron beam at Los Alamos  Neutron Science 
Center to measure cross sections of spallation products that are
backgrounds to supernova nus.  Later it will be moved to a 
neutrino source at SNS Oak Ridge or the on-axis NuMI beam.

*** Luk and Wang win 2014 Panofsky Prize
</H1> <P>
Kam-biu Luk from Lawrence Berkeley National Lab and Yifang Wang
from the Institute of High Energy Physics have won the W.K.H.
Panofsky Prize in Experimental Particle Physics from the APS
for 2014.  The citation is "For their leadership of the Daya Bay
experiment which produced the first definitive measurement of
the theta-13 angle of the neutrino mixing matrix."

*** Big Bird wins a neutrino namesake, and a Mycenaean cow
</H1> <P>
Ice-Cube seems to like to name its neutrinos after Sesame Street
characters, and the latest high energy event is called "Big Bird".

Minoan scholars struggle with Linear A, but Linear B was found
to be a version of Greek.  Did they find any interesting history
when they deciphered Linear B?  No, it was mostly tax records. 
There are no names of kings, but they do have the name of a cow.

*** Joe Grange's neutrino thesis wins multiple awards
</H1> <P>
Joe Grange's thesis, "First Measurement of the Muon Anti-Neutrino 
Charged Current Quasielastic Double-Differential Cross Section"
will be published by Springer Theses Series, which comes with
a 500 Euro award.  It also wins the URA thesis award at FNAL.

*** Justin Evans wins IOP Group Prize
</H1> <P>
The UK-based Institute of Physics recently awarded the 2014 High 
Energy Particle Physics Group Prize to Justin Evans of the 
University of Manchester.  The prize is awarded to Evans "for his 
world-leading contributions to the measurement of neutrino 
oscillations at MINOS using the Fermilab NuMI beam."

*** Xin Qian and Lisa Kaufman win DOE Early Career Awards
</H1> <P>
Xin at Brookhaven is working on Detector Development toward
precision measurements of neutrino mixing.  Lisa is working on
characterizing backgrounds for EXO.

*** We all win as MIPP measures yields from a neutrino target
</H1> <P>
Jon Paley et al. have analyzed the data from Fermilab E907
measuring production of hadrons from 1.42e6 120-GeV protons 
hitting a NuMI target.  Normalized charged pion yields were 
found in bins of longitudinal and transverse momentum between
0.5 and 80 GeV/c with combined syst/stat uncertainties 5-10%.

*** Karol Lang wins MINOS+ cospokesperson election
</H1> <P>
U of Texas physicist Karol Lang is the new cospokesperson of 
MINOS+ along with Jenny Thomas from University College/London.  

<H1>
*** 1032 wins over 1033
</H1> <P>
The Fermilab PAC recommended approval of P-1032, a search for
Dark Matter with MiniBooNE, and its request for 1.75e20 pot in
beam dump mode.  It did not recommend P-1033, MiniBooNE+, which
requested 6.0e20 pot and the addition of 300 kg of wavelength
shifting PPO to observe 2.2 MeV gammas from neutron capture and
reduce NC background to nue appearance by half.

*** Mini MICE (Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment)
</H1> <P>
At a MICE review at RAL by DOE and STFC, the 2 funding agencies 
are leaning towards a "Minimal" MICE plan. Major hardware already 
delivered and to be delivered during the next 2-3 years would 
allow the demonstration of ionization cooling with re-acceleration. 
MICE would continue another 3 years (was 6) with DOE funding of 
$12M (was $30M). Overall it was a positive review.
