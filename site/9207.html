THIS IS THE LAST UNSOLICITED ISSUE YOU WILL RECEIVE
</p><p>This is the third of a planned series of approximately
monthly newsletters on the progress of P822 and the Fermilab
Long Baseline Neutrino Oscillation effort.  If you have

</p><h1>ASPEN PAC MEETING</h1>
Last month we heard that the Aspen PAC meeting was very positive
about the Long Baseline/Short Baseline effort.   They reaffirmed
their view on the importance of the study of poissible neutrino
oscillations as likely to be an important aspect of the future of the
lab, and they gave the lab "encouragement to resume its planning
process to develop an integrated plan for both short and long
baseline experiments".
<p>
</p><h1>R&amp;D firm</h1>
The Fermilab administration is considering hiring two Architectural/
Engineering firms under contract to work on the Neutrino Beam
project.  A selection board is being put together among Fermilab
management types.  The process is expected to take 3-6 months.
The present idea was to give each firm a 3 year contract with
possible extension to 5 years.  The goal is to better understand
costs associated with a beam pitched down towards Soudan, and
produce a "real" conceptual design.  One estimate was 6-10 thousand
hours of work on this design.

</p><h1>Fermilab Users Meeting</h1>
Bill Reay gave a well received talk on the Neutrino Oscillation
Physics Program at Fermilab.  Bill Hess from the DOE also spoke
positively about the need for a neutrino program.
<p>
</p><h1>Soudan Plant Facilities Report</h1>
A document about the Plant Facilities and Cavity at the
Soudan site has been prepared by Don Jankowski at ANL.  This
provides a starting point for consideration of any second
generation long baseline detector, in terms of space available,
cage size, electrical, ventilation and safety considerations,
etc.  It is available as PDK-520 from Argonne.
<p>
</p><h1>Detector R&amp;D</h1>
Fermilab has made available to the Short Baseline/Long Baseline
neutrino effort some funds for detector R&amp;D through the
research division.
BUT AS OF JULY 31 IT HAS BEEN FROZEN!
The following efforts and effort makers
are the present Long Baseline involvement:
<ul>
<li>Hole in wall detector--John Alner, Rutherford Lab
</li><li>Resisitive plate chamber prototype--Dave Cockerill, Rutherford Lab
</li><li>Aluminum tube prototype--Bill Oliver, Tufts
</li><li>Extruded plastic Drift tubes--Ken Heller, Minnesota
</li><li>Visit and possible collaboration--Vladimir Tsarev, Lebedev Inst.
</li></ul>

would see oscillations!
