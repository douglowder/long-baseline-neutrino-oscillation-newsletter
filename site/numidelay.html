<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    By Heather Vogell</p>
<p>                    Tribune staff reporter</p>
<p>                    July 1, 2001 </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    Already 18 months behind schedule, an ambitious high-energy physics experiment at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory lost yet more</p>
<p>                    time as an investigation into workplace accidents halted construction last week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    With the experiment also over budget, some scientists worry the delays will give foreign competitors an edge in the race to make the latest discovery into the elusive</p>
<p>                    subatomic particle, the neutrino.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    Neutrinos are so small, yet so ubiquitous, that a million are passing through any given gallon of space at any moment. There are so many that some cosmologists suspect</p>
<p>                    they collectively have as much mass as all the stars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    Though it exists virtually everywhere, the ghostly particle is so hard to study that Fermilab is digging an underground tunnel a mile long to beam the particles from here to</p>
<p>                    Minnesota just to get a good look at how they behave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    Different groups of physicists are vying to show definitively that neutrinos have mass and thus play a key role in the working of the universe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    Yet 15 months after it began, the project has run into trouble. Scientists said Fermilab's problems have become a topic at lunch tables and conferences throughout the</p>
<p>                    country, where some worry about competitors such as CERN Laboratory in Switzerland. A similar experiment is scheduled to begin there in May 2005.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    "The U.S. is holding its own right now, but certainly CERN is always a threat to surpass us," said Robert Park, a physics professor at the University of Maryland and</p>
<p>                    director of public information for the American Physical Society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    A deeper understanding of one of the universe's fundamental building blocks is not all that's at stake. The reputation of the American science program abroad and</p>
<p>                    congressional support for physics projects at home also feed off such successes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    "This is important to the United States, this is not just a soccer game," Park said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    With its price tag climbing to nearly $168 million, Fermilab's so-called NuMi project is about 20 percent more costly than originally estimated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    But Fermilab Director Michael Witherell said workers' safety is the most pressing issue right now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    "At this point, we're concerned about safety and we'll worry about schedule later," Witherell said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    The U.S. Department of Energy this week sent a team of experts to Fermilab to launch a monthlong investigation into a recent construction accident.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    Steven Lumbert, 53, of Montgomery in Kane County was drilling an air shaft when a piece of equipment snapped loose and struck him in the head. After spending a</p>
<p>                    week in a critical care wing, he was listed in good condition last week at Delnor Community Hospital in Geneva.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    The energy team will also look at 10 other accidents that have caused workers to miss days on the job since the project began, officials said. The probe, termed a "Type</p>
<p>                    A" investigation, is the most comprehensive form reserved for serious accidents, said Jeff Sherwood, an Energy Department spokesman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    A representative from the construction project's lead contractor, S.A. Healy, declined to comment on the investigation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    Construction restarted Friday after a weeklong stand-down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    The scientific community is eager to get on with preparations for the experiment, which aims to map out new territory in the subatomic world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    Most of the time, neutrinos zip through space without paying much heed to anything. Their failure to interact with other particles has made them hard to pin down, and for</p>
<p>                    years, scientists thought they had no mass at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    Advances in the last three years provide good evidence that neutrinos have an infinitesimal mass that causes them to transform--or oscillate--between three forms, which</p>
<p>                    scientists call "flavors." There are electron, muon and tau neutrinos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    Several laboratories have studied neutrinos coming from the sun, the atmosphere or from particle accelerators. But in late 2004 or 2005, according to a revised</p>
<p>                    schedule, Fermilab hopes to run the first experiment in which neutrinos are created in a controlled setting and travel hundreds of miles before being measured again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    For the study, the particle accelerator at Fermilab will manufacture a stream of muon neutrinos and send it through the Earth to an old iron mine in Soudan, Minn., 450</p>
<p>                    miles away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    An instant (0.0025 seconds) later, a detector in the mine will take a second snapshot of the particles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    Physicists hope to get better data on neutrinos' oscillation, and therefore, their mass, opening up new doors for theories of the universe. The results will complement those</p>
<p>                    of previous experiments in laboratories in New Mexico, Switzerland, Canada and Japan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    "It's a huge puzzle and each one of us goes out and gets a little piece," said Janet Conrad, a professor at Columbia University and researcher at Fermilab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    The findings could also have significance for scientists peering into space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    Cosmologists want to know how much of matter believed to exist in the universe, but yet to be accounted for, can be attributed to neutrinos. Such mystery matter</p>
<p>                    explains the force of gravity that keeps galaxies from spinning apart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    Stars make up only a half a percent of all matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    "We think that neutrinos, based on previous experiments, contribute at least a half a percent," said Michael Turner, chairman of the astrophysics department at the</p>
<p>                    University of Chicago. "So they're at least as important as stars."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    Witherell said cost overruns came in two major areas. Original estimates were too low both for the construction of the tunnel and two caverns, and for the beam line that</p>
<p>                    the neutrinos pass through before heading to Minnesota.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    The delays are tied to the overruns, and Fermilab plans to request additional funding from Congress for fiscal year 2003--the year the experiment was originally</p>
<p>                    scheduled to take place, he said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    "In some sense, it's not surprising that when you tackle such large, difficult, novel projects, that one of them might have some unexpected costs ... and schedule delays,"</p>
<p>                    Witherell said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>                    "We are doing things that haven't been done before; it's different from just building a building."</p></font>
