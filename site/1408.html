*** LAGUNA-LBNO turns in design study
</h1> <p>
Slides from an open meeting marking completion of the design
studies and transition to the realization phase of LAGUNA/LBNO are
at

</a>
Several work product documents were delivered on 31 August, and
will be made public on the arXiv.  There are more than 4000 pages
and a 478 MB pdf file.   The next step beyond the LAGUNA-LBNO
design is the realization of the 1:20 scale "demonstrator"
called LBNO-DEMO, endorsed (so far) by 120 from 22 institutes.
WA105 is scheduling an October meeting at CERN.

*** IIEB for a Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility
</h1> <p>
Fermilab is actively responding to the P5 call to create a new
international collaboration to fulfill the long-baseline vision
in that report.  An "interim International Executive Board", IIEB,
has been appointed to guide preparations for a letter-of-intent
(LOI).  There are roughly 20 leading neutrino scientists from
around the world together with several funding agency
representatives.  They plan to meet in September.  A working group
of funding agency, lab and other people has been formed to draft
an international project governance plan for LBNF.

*** LBNE continues to grow

</a>
When a new international collaboration comes into existence, it
is expected that most everyone on LBNE will join.  But meanwhile
there is work to do and LBNE does not want to interfere with new
partners, so it is not using the name LBNF.  (Let's hope there is
a new name when the time comes!)  LBNE how has 537 collaborators,
making it the largest neutrino collaboration to date.

*** T2K near detector sterile neutrino tests
</h1> <p>

</a>
In a search for electron neutrino events as a function of
energy in the T2K near detector (FGD water target and TPC tracking
chambers) they see less events than expected in a way that is
consistent with nue disappearance.  dmsq_41=2.14 eV^2 for the
best fit.  Fitting the energy distribution, the null hypothesis
is rejected at 94%, i.e. the data does not fit no-oscillations
well in this test motivated by the sterile neutrino hypothesis.
This matches MiniBooNE's sterile nu delta m-squared, but it's
strange that a nue disappearance signal in a numu beam can
support a nue appearance signal in a numu beam.

This is a web site with up-to-date results for the global fit
to neutrino oscillation parameters from Gonzalez-Garcia, Maltoni
and Schwetz.  This points to the  current version 1.3, made after
Neutrino 2014.  Version 2.0 is in preparation.

*** NOvA Near Detector Completed
</h1> <p>
In August, a team from the NOvA collaboration led by Louise
Suter and Marco Colo finished instrumenting the final block of the NOvA near
detector, with all electronics turned on.  It is 350 feet
underground on the Fermilab site, the 330-ton NOvA near
detector is filled with liquid scintillator.  Previously, NOvA
had run a Near Detector on the Surface (NDOS) and recently also
completed its 14 kiloton Far Detector in Ash River Minnesota.
This near detector is located at the same off-axis angle as the
far detector and will be used to measure the unoscillated beam.

Nessie is an idea for a neutrino program there.

*** NuFACT moving to winter
</h1> <p>
The next NuFACT and International Neutrino Summer School (INSS)
will be in August 2015 in Brazil.  NuFACT will be at CBPF in Rio
10-15 Aug.  The Summer School will be 17-28 August at the ICTP
South American Institute for Fundamental Research in Sao Paulo.
The INSS will, curiously, happen in Winter (as well as NuFACT) so,
please, get your swim suit, sun protection and surf board ready.

*** Do you know the location of your slide rule?
</h1> <p>
I was at a wedding of a physicist and an attorney this month
where the officiant, a federal judge, said she had married many
lawyers before, but had never married a neutrino physicist.  In
a toast, I mentioned that I didn't know where my slide rule was.
Eleven people (so far) have told me they know where theirs is.
