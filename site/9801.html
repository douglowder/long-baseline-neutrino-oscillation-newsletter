*** NuMI gets environmental ok
</h1>A FONSI (Finding Of No SIgnificant Impact) doesn't mean that
no-one cares about neutrinos.  It means that the DOE has
determined that the neutrino project at the main injector has
considered the appropriate environmental issues in its design, and
no environmental impact statement is required.

*** Lower Omega leaves less for neutrinos?
</h1>Astronomers are now more loudly saying that Omega-total is about
0.2, rather than 1.0 as many astrophysicists have long said.
There still needs to be dark matter, but not as much.  The
argument against all of the dark matter being neutrinos is still
that one could not account for structure formation.  One theorist
thinks this argues against more short-baseline experiments.

*** COSMOS looking for emulsion
</h1>The emulsion group which provided the emulsion for COSMOS at
Fermilab and TOSCA at CERN has pulled out of both short-baseline
experiments, perhaps due to increased interest in long-baseline
experiments.  COSMOS is now scrambling to find a new target.

***  BooNe Proposal has first hearing at Fermilab PAC
</h1>The MiniBooNE proposal was well received by the FNAL PAC Jan 9th.
"The MiniBooNE collaboration has persuaded the PAC that their
experiment would have the sensitivity to definitively confirm or rule
out the LSND signal.  The anticipated signal size assuming the LSND
oscillation parameters would be ~1000 events.  This large number of
events would allow a first estimate of Dm2 and sin22q from the shape
of the energy distribution of observed events....From a scientific
point of view, the Committee feels that the experiment is fully
justified."   Consideration for approval will be in May.

*** Neutrinos in Aspen, January, June and July
</h1>Transparencies from the Aspen winter meeting, which focused on neutrinos
and skiing will soon be on the web.  From June 15 to July 12, there will
be a workshop on  "Neutrino Physics and Astrophysics: from Solar to
Ultra-High Energy Neutrinos" at the Aspen Center for Physics.  This
resulted from one proposal covering neutrino physics at low energies
and another High Energy Neutrino Astrophysics workshop
Applications are at http://andy.bu.edu/aspen/application/

*** Super-Duper Kamiokande trigger
</h1>When the Superconducting Super Collider was cancelled a few years
ago, it was predicted that the next accelerator would not have
"super" in its name.  But SuperKamiokande has survived this
verbal curse and is providing some of the most beautiful neutrino
data right now.  In order to see more solar neutrinos, they now
have a "super-low energy trigger" at 4.6 MeV threshold.  This
superseded the 5.5 MeV threshold in June 1997.

*** Auger to measure neutrinos?
</h1>As reported in New Scientist, Chan Hong-mo suggests the neutrino
cross section rises with E enough to be a candidate explanation for the
10^20 eV energy events seen by air shower experiments.  Those same
events are part of the motivation for Auger, since it is hard to
explain the highest energy cosmic rays due to a lack of close
Active Galactic Nuclei, coupled with the Zatsepin-Greisen cutoff
for protons from far AGN's.   However another paper by Burdman et
al (hep-ph/9709399) rules this out based on a s-channel unitarity.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Auger to measure missiles?
</h1>In a November 1997 SAGENAP report, Auger was rejected.  However
it will be revised and resubmitted.    Meanwhile an unarmed cruise missile
fired from a B-52 bomber at the Dugway Proving ground north of the
proposed Auger site hit a trailer used by a Japanese cosmic-ray
observatory.  No one was hurt, as the area is routinely evacuated
during missile tests, but the missile was in the wrong place.

*** Amanda finishes third hole; Ice-cube workshop
</h1>Three deep strings are now deployed, along with 2 television
cameras 2000 m deep in the ice.  It has been promised that live
events will be available from their web page.
An intense two day workshop to initiate the conceptual design of
ICECUBE - a kilometer-scale neutrino facility based on AMANDA
will be held at UC Irvine March 27-28 1998.  See
http://www.ps.uci.edu/~icecube or email

They present a 4-nu model (one sterile) which has maximal numu to
nutau  oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos and explains solar
and LSND results. It predicts nue to nutau and nue to numu
in long-baseline experiments with L/E &gt; 1 km/GeV.
