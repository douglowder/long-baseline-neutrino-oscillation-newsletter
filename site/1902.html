</A>
The JINR Scientific Council at its 125th session has approved the
recommendation of the International jury to award the 2018 Bruno
Pontecorvo prize to Prof. Francis Halzen (University of Wisconsin)
for his leading role in the construction of the IceCube detector &
experimental discovery of very high energy cosmological neutrinos.

*** QuarkNet and Neutrinos
</H1> <P>
QuarkNet, in collaboration with MINERvA, is launching its 1st nu-
based masterclass this Spring. High school students around the
world will become neutrino physicists for a day, performing an
analysis in which they identify quasielastic-like events and use
transverse kinematic imbalance to measure the size of the carbon
nucleus.  They will video conference with other classrooms that
have completed the same exercise and with 2 FNAL physicists that
will engage them in conversations about the exercise, nu physics,
and life in science. They'd welcome participation in this program
by hosting a masterclass at your institution for local high school
students -- contact Rob Fine

*** New T2K spokesperson
</H1> <P>
In December, T2K elected Prof. Atsuko Ichikawa from Kyoto University
 as the next T2K spokesperson.

*** NOvA record running protons on target (pot)
</H1> <P>
In January, NOvA received a weekly record 21.7e18 pot from the Main
Injector.  It has obtained 12e20 pot in the reverse horn current
mode, featuring antineutrinos.  At the end of February, the NuMI
beam switched back to Forward Horn Current (neutrino) running.

<H1>
*** Bounds on long-range interactions of neutrinos
</H1> <P>
A universe full of electrons together with IceCube results leads
to an unprecedented sensitivity and limits on new interactions.

(2019) and

<H1>
*** New release of GIBUU
</H1> <P>
The GiBUU project provides a unified theory and transport
framework in the MeV and GeV energy regimes for elementary
reactions on nuclei, including current and future nu oscillation
experiments.  The new release 'GiBUU 2019' is available for
download from 
<A href="http://gibuu.hepforge.org/">

*** PIP-II groundbreaking
</H1> <P>
PIP-II is a key project to support future high intensity
neutrino running at Fermilab.  On Friday 15 March, an official
groundbreaking ceremony for PIP-II will take place at FNAL.

*** Argon Cube 2x2
</H1> <P>
ArgonCube proposes an advanced approach for building Liquid Argon
Time Projection Chambers (TPCs).  The principal novelty of
ArgonCube is a modular design which allows for the scalability to
a large active detector mass without losing a significant amount
of active volume. The ArgonCube design will be applied in DUNE, a
next generation neutrino experiment.

*** Know your neutrinos?
</H1> <P>
A new interactive feature of "Fermilab News at Work" will ask a
question and invite users to be the 1st to answer correctly.

*** Another New format for this newsletter
</H1> <P>
After both complaints and compliments about the switch last month
to an .html attachment for this newsletter, this month I will go
back to the ASCII text format but also add an .HTML attachment
that looks better to many.  Let me know any more thoughts.

<H1>
*** One reader reacts to the preprint on "Neutrino Mistakes"
</H1> <P>
"I really enjoyed your paper 
1901.07068, it's wonderful.  Maybe
the first paper where I was glad to see none of my work cited..."
