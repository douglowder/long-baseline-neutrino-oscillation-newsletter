</p><h1>822 proposal going together</h1>
822 has been asked by Fermilab to submit a revised
proposal by October 12th, 1993, in conjunction with the
November PAC meeting.   A tex file containing the draft
proposal is available.  It is rapidly changing as monte
carlo work is completed and different ideas about how to
approach Fermilab concerns are discussed.

<h1>Meeting with Peoples/Letter</h1>
On 14 September, 822 received a letter from Fermilab
Director John Peoples that the PAC is enthusiastic about
the scientific prospects of a neutrino oscillation
program.  In addition to considering the NUMI program at
the November PAC meeting, they are studying the
suitability of existing beam lines for other neutrino
oscillation experiments.

<h1>822 Collaboration Meeting</h1>
The 822 collaboration meeting is 2 October in
Minneapolis.  Anyone needing an agenda, directions, etc.
let me know.

<h1>Alternative use for p-bar beam being considered. </h1>
Wonyong Lee and the Columbia group are considering using
the AP2 line (which makes p-bars) to do a long baseline
neutrino experiment about 100 km from Fermilab.  This is
a very promising idea which needs to be fully explored.

<h1>8 Gev booster beam?  </h1>
A low energy neutrino beam could also be made from the 8
GeV booster.  Calculations show that such a beam could
produce limits similar to the Brookhaven experiment
BNL889.

<h1>New "cheap" long baseline idea for Brookhaven</h1>
T. Kycia at Brookhaven has an idea to improve 889 by
replacing the water with steel plate optical spark
chambers with video camera read-out.  He would also take
out the kink in the beam and put his detector in
Connecticut

<h1>FESS progress</h1>
Drilling of test bore holes along the NUMI beam is
proceeding, and Fermilab engineers are incorporating the
information in a facility cost estimate.  The first
hole, at the detector location, hit dolomite 60 feet
down.  The hole reached shale before the detector depth,
and went down to 253 feet.  An early characterization of
the shale was that it is solid rock, but fractured in
places.  Meanwhile engineering drawings of the target,
dump, and detector facility are progressing well.

<h1>Sterile neutrino oscillations ruled out</h1>
Shi, Schramm and Fields (see below) have shown that
strong mixing of nu-mu or nu-e to sterile neutrinos is
ruled out by the primordial Helium abundance for mass
squared about 10^-6.  This rules out oscillations to
sterile neutrinos as a possible explanation of the
atmospheric neutrino deficit, rules out large angle MSW
solution for nu-e to nu-sterile, and rules out nu-mu to
nu-sterile oscillations as a possible signal for 822.

<h1>Nuclear Physics Workshop</h1>
A workshop on "Frontiers in Neutrino Physics" in
association with the DNP meeting of the APS is
20-October 1993 in Asilomar.  The morning session is
devoted to Solar neutrinos.  The afternoon to
atmospheric, accelerator, reactor and supernova neutrino
signatures for neutrino mass.  Contact Kevin Lesko,
