<p> </p><h1> *** LSND doubles statistics </h1>
In a run ending December 1st at Los Alamos, LSND finished a 4-month
run which doubled their statistics.  On-line, things appear as
before.  Next year they will get an eight month run which will
double their statistics again, but there might be some changes in
the targeting.

<p> </p><h1> *** OECD letter
</h1>
A group of neutrino physicists coordinated by Al Mann is urging
the U.S. delegates to the Organization for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD) and its Megascience Forum to establish a
working group for the study of a possible cubic kilometer
neutrino observatory at its Jan. 1996 meeting.  Neither the OECD
nor the Megascience Forum are funding agencies.  They are
facilitators of international cooperation to encourage working
group studies of "megascience" projects.  This action might help
to unify the efforts of American scientists with interest in
neutrino astrophysics to raise support and to manifest an
American presence in this field of research.  Scientific
motivations for an International Neutrino Astrophysical
Observatory, as proposed by a Greek delegate to the forum,
include AGN studies, neutrinos in the universe, dark matter,
origin of highest energy cosmic rays, Earth tomography,
and geophysical and environmental problems.

<p> </p><h1> *** Soudan thesis studies backgrounds from events in the rock.
</h1>
In a Ph.D. study finished this month, Tufts student William
Leeson studied events which appeared contained in the Soudan
detector, but which had hits in the proportional tube "shield".
He was investigating in particular whether there could be
backgrounds to contained neutrino events from this source
without a track in the shield.  These would presumably be due
to neutron and K-long interactions.  He found the possibility of
a background in the "track" sample, 5.7 +- 3.5 events,
and 2.0 +- 3.7  "showers".  With large errors, this is
about double an earlier estimate based on shield corrections,
but only for the tracks, not the showers.  He estimates the
neutrino flavor ratio as .63 +- .22.

<p> </p><h1> *** MINOS grows, meets
</h1>
A JINR/Dubna from including Gena Alexeev and Sasha Olshevski
has joined MINOS.  IHEP (Beijing) and PNPI-St. Petersburg
presented proposals to join in December.  A meeting at IHEP
in Beijing on November 29th attracted 12 participants
who discussed the physics motivation of MINOS, and streamer
tube production and experience.  The next MINOS meetings are
February 10-11 at Fermilab, April 15-16 possibly in UK,
and a week-long workshop at a midwest resort June 5-10.

<p> </p><h1> *** COSMOS established procedure for EMCAL decision
</h1>
COSMOS is considering three technologies for their
electromagnetic calorimeter;  gas, liquid and leadglass.  They
have established a committee to compare the options and
instruments to use to choose. They'll form a recommendation
February 17th and report at the 2/18 COSMOS meeting.

<p> </p><h1> *** New nu-beam ideas at beam workshop
</h1>
The Nevis neutrino beam workshop heard about ideas to use a
Lithium lens in the wideband beam, to run with a bare target to
optimize the disappearance experiment, and a new method of
extraction which may add flexibility in spill length.
Another new idea has been written up to use channeling in bent
crystals to make neutrino beams (see below).

<p> </p><h1> *** Neutrinos close to home,,,I mean House
</h1>
Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI) will become Chairman of the House
Science Committee next year if the Republicans retain
control, now that Robert Walker is retiring.  His
district is east central Wisconsin, from suburban
Milwaukee up to Menomenee.  The Fermilab neutrino beam
will go near, but not under, his district.

<p> </p><h1> *** HEPAP; subpanel report available
</h1>
John Peoples mentioned NuMI in his Dec. HEPAP talk, but added
that they'd heard quite a bit about it lately, so didn't describe
it further.  The bound version of the subpanel report is out
DOE/ER-0662.  It is available to DOE contractors from Box 62,
Oak Ridge Tennessee 37831.  615-576-8401 for prices.  It is
available to the public from the National Technical
Information Service, Springfield Va. 22161, (703)487-4650.
