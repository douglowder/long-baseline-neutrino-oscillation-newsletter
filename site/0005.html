*** A billion here, a billion there
</h1>
One opinion about planning future HEP facilities is that
projects costlier than $1B will not be funded.  The strategy then
should be to stage facilities in $1B pieces.   The nu factory cost
estimate is not yet public, but the ballpark guesses are that
it could be built in one or two stages.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Next steps for neutrino factories
</h1>
The FNAL Physics and Machine Study reports for nufactory are both
available.

The physics group has identified 3 next steps:  1) Compare the
physics with the capabilities of an upgraded conventional beam,
with emphasis on numu to nue (sin^2 theta 13), 2) Further study
the polarization yields and 3) pursue detector possibilities and
develop a desirable R&amp;D program.

*** Radon implications workshop
</h1>
A workshop on Radon (and its implications for neutrino experiments)
will be held at nu-2000 on June 14th, before the LoNu workshop.

*** NNN00-2
</h1>
The next meeting for planning a Next Generation Nucleon Decay and
Neutrino Detector (NNN) will be at Fermilab August 7-8.
e-mail to

for any inquiries.  Working groups
have been organized on 1) site, 2) detector, 3)photo-detectors,
4) nu-factory aspects and 5) physics/simulation

*** NuMI groundbreaking May 31st
</h1>
It was wet but speeches were moved to Fermilab's auditorium and
the shovel photo-op to the atrium garden.  Healy is already
blasting down in the dolomite.  First neutrinos due Oct 1, 2003.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Sensenbrenner visits Fermilab
</h1>
The Chairman of the House Science Committee toured Fermilab May
15th.  He gave Fermilab some hope of getting the $33M shortfall
in the fiscal 2001 budget put back before the budget is approved.
Some of that money is needed for MINOS detector construction.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Fermilab PAC promises MINOS data before 2010
</h1>
The FNAL PAC noted that "NuMI/MINOS is most at risk in the
current budget difficulties.  It is thus appropriate that the
committee emphasizes that MINOS is likely to be the most important
neutrino experiment of the decade..."

<p> </p><h1>
*** The sphinx's questions on Neutrinos
</h1>
"What would be the most important experiment in the coming years
which has anything to do with neutrino masses?"  Minakata
suggests that it is proton decay in
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0004249"> hep-ph/0004249. </a>


<p> </p><h1>
*** THESEUS near detector?
</h1>
The 1 kT fine-grained Soudan 2 detector was built to search for
proton decay.  It's use along with the new 6 kT magnetic MINOS
detector is called THESEUS.  A working group is investigating
costs, overlap rates, and physics potential for taking a few
Soudan modules and putting them next to the MINOS near detector.
But a consensus on this plan has failed to emerge so far.
A THESEUS near detector is not in the MINOS project cost.

<p> </p><h1>
*** A THESEUS fan?
</h1>
Speaking at Oxford, B. Richter opined "MINOS is too coarse-grained
for the low energy neutrinos" and that "people should concentrate on
finer-grained detectors".  He was anti neutrino-factories and is
pushing/suggesting long-baseline experiments using conventional
beams of higher (x 10 -- 100) intensities which are cheaper.
