*** Borexino measures Oscillating Solar Neutrinos
</H1> <P>
This experiment at the Gran Sasso in Italy has just made the first 
direct measurement of 7Be solar neutrinos.  They get 
47+-7(stat)+-12(sys) counts/day/100ton.  The expectation based on 
the solar model plus LMA oscillations is 49+-4.  Without 
oscillations it would be 75+-4.  7Be nus all have E = 0.862MeV.
It is impressive that they achieved an excellent background level
without any further but the initial purification.

*** What's in a name?  Pursuing neutrinos with Project X
</H1> <P>
When cost of the ILC came out, US Under Secretary for Science Ray 
Orbach suggested the timescale for the ILC would stretch into the 
"middle or end of the 2020s" and that HEP needed new studies.

Fermilab appointed a steering committee, led by Y.K. Kim to study
Fermilab's options and they have released a report. "...a central
feature of the proposed Fermilab plan calls for building an 
intense proton facility, Project X, consisting of a linear 
accelerator with the currently-planned characteristics of the ILC, 
Fermilab's existing Recycler Ring, and the Main Injector."  
Similar to, but not exactly matching previous plans for the proton 
driver, or the High Intensity Neutrino Source (HINS) it was given 
a name which isn't a name, so the name will be chosen later.

*** More neutrino quotes from Fermilab Steering Group Report
</H1> <P>
<ul>
 <li>"Fermilab should also work toward increased resources for 
longer-term future accelerators such as a muon collider, aiming at 
higher energies than the ILC would provide."
<li>"Neutrino experiments,...,offer their own window on unification, 
the question of whether all the forces and particles of matter 
become one.  ...As part of Fermilab's world-class program in 
neutrino science, the laboratory has embarked on the NOvA 
experiment.  NOvA will provide the first chance at determining the 
relative masses of neutrinos, a key piece of information for 
understanding the role of neutrinos in unification."  
<li> "If ILC departs from the GDE-proposed timeline, Fermilab should
pursue additional neutrino science and precision science 
opportunities by upgrading the proton accelerator complex."
</ul>
<H1>
*** More names for Fermilab intensity accelerator upgrades
</H1> <P>
<ul>
 <li> ANU (Part of NOvA): 700 kW by slip-stacking 12 Booster batches
into the recycler
 <li> SNuMI: (Super NuMI) 1.2 MW by stacking 18 Booster batches using
both the Accumulator and the Recycler
 <li> Project X: 2.3 MW by replacing the Booster with an 
ILC-technology linace which feeds the recycler.
</ul>

<H1>
*** NOvA passes another in a series of reviews
</H1> <P>
NOvA passed a Fermilab internal Director's review in August and 
now has its CD23a Lehman review in October, where the final mass 
(15kT) associated with its $260M cap will be evaluated & approved.

<H1>
*** We live in a neutrino bath! 
</H1> <P>
Three new neutrino poems have been added to the neutrino poetry
page.  
<A href="http://www.neutrinooscillation.org/poetry/"> 
http://www.neutrinooscillation.org/poetry/  </A>
Stanza 9
of David Mermin's poem from the July 2007 Physics Today includes:
"Neutrinos have the smallest masses Of all the fundamental classes 
Of particles. As I recall They've hardly any mass at all."
Also included is a Bengali poem about neutrinos, written for WIN07
in Calcutta.  As we all know, Bengali poems are best listened to,
so a .wav file is linked.  The Bengali script is also beautiful.

<H1>
*** Neutrinos in 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2030
</H1> <P>
Neutrino 2008 will be held May 26-31 at the University of
Canterbury in Christchurch New Zealand.  A web page is being
developed at 
<A href="http://www.neutrino2008.co.nz/"> http://www.neutrino2008.co.nz/.  </A>
Neutrino 2010 will 
be 14-20 June 2010 in Athens Greece.  Neutrino 2012 will be in 
Kyoto Japan, and Neutrino 2014 will probably be in North America.  
The location for Neutrino 2030, the centennial of Pauli's letter, 
is still up for grabs.

<H1>
*** Neutrino Journal Club at Fermilab starting again
</H1> <P>
Following a poll, the meeting of the Fermilab Neutrino Journal 
Club has been moved to Thursdays at noon.  Contact 
<A href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0a797e6f6c6b647961634a6c646b66246d657c"> mailto:<span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7201061714131c01191b32141c131e5c151d04">[email&#160;protected]</span> </A>
to get on the email list.

*** Encarta's definition of an antineutrino
</H1> <P>
an�ti�neu�tri�no (plural an�ti�neu�tri�nos) noun
<br>Definition:  "antiparticle of neutrino: the antiparticle of a 
neutrino. When a neutrino and an antineutrino are brought 
together, mutual annihilation occurs."
Do you think Encarta carried out that experiment?

<H1>
