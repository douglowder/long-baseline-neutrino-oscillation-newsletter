*** Rumors continue to plague INO
</H1> <P>
India's government allocated US$225 million to construction when
it gave the INO the green light last year, but the Madras High
Court in Chennai brought the project to a standstill in March
following a petition from local activists and politicians. The
court said that the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board must give
consent before construction can start. This is normally a 45-day
step, but this hasn't happened yet after 9 months.

*** Long-baseline rumors; caveat from this newsletter's web site
</H1> <P>
Long-Baseline News is a newsletter which includes rumors and
references about neutrinos. It should not be used as a reference.
It can be used to follow-up rumors which may be of interest (and
may or may not turn out to be true.) To help prevent people taking
it too seriously, I do not put in retractions when the rumor turns
out to be incorrect, but I will try to fix the web page version.

*** Shakespeare on Rumors; (Henry IV part 2)
</H1> <P>
"Open your ears, for which of you will stop The vent of hearing
when loud Rumor speaks?  I, from the orient to the drooping west,
Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold The acts commenced on
this ball of earth.  Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,
The which in every language I pronounce, Stuffing the ears of men
with false reports.  I speak of peace while covert enmity Under
the smile of safety wounds the world.  And who but Rumor, who but
only I, Make fearful musters and prepared defense, Whiles the big
year, swoll'n with some other grief, Is thought with child by the
stern tyrant war, And no such matter? Rumor is a pipe Blown by
surmises, jealousies, conjectures, And of so easy and so plain a
stop That the blunt monster with uncounted heads, The still-
discordant wav'ring multitude, Can play upon it. But what need I
thus My well-known body to anatomize Among my household?
Why is Rumor here?"

<H1>
*** Gravitational Waves; can a rumor confirm a rumor?
</H1> <P>
The fraction of rumors that are true is much higher than the
fraction of possible rumors that are true.  But it is not unity.
We'll see how the rumor on gravity-wave detection shakes out. 
Maybe we'll hear something 11 Feb.  Or AAAS meeting on 12 Feb.

*** NuFACT 2016 21-17 August in Vietnam; School at GSSI in July
</H1> <P>
There's a rumor that a 5th working group will be added to consider
neutrino physics beyond the PMNS matrix.  The workshop will take
place in Quy Nhon, Vietnam 21-27 Aug 16.
The chair is Takashi Kobayashi with co-chairs A. Blondel and
J. Morfin.

*** Short-Baseline Neutrino Experiment at JPARC
</H1> <P>
J-PARC E56, JSNS2, a search for sterile neutrinos at J-PARC, has
received stage-1 approval.  The plan is for a >100 ton liquid
scintillator detector 24 meters from a mercury target.  Next
is preparation of a technical Design Report.

*** First NOvA oscillation papers available on arXiv
</H1> <P>
The first measurements of nue appearance and numu disappearance
by NOvA were reported last summer.  Two papers have now appeared
on the arXiv:  
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05022"> arXiv:1601.05022 </A>
and 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05037"> arXiv:1601.05037. </A>
The delay was due to
correcting a misunderstanding in the survey location of the Near
Detector, so that the data/MC hadronic energy scale difference is
now smaller.  The oscillation results are consistent but have a
different look.  The significance of nue appearance (3.3 sigma)
is unchanged.  The best fits for delta m^2_32 and sin^2 theta_23
are now 2.52 +.20 -.18 e-3 eV^2 and 0.38-0.65.

<H1>
*** Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) CDR on arXiv
</H1> <P>
All four volumes of the Conceptual Design Report for DUNE/LBNF
are now available:

*** Fermilab Booster sets record
</H1> <P>
The Booster Neutrino Beam has been delivering excellent beam to
MicroBooNE since October, 2015.  Set a BNB intensity record on
January 25 with sustained running of 5e12 ppp at 5 Hz.
MicroBooNE has accumulated 1.3e20 protons on target since 15 Oct.

*** The NuMI beams "use by" date has passed
</H1> <P>
The NuMI neutrino beam was built in the early 2000's for MINOS, a
6-year experiment. The civil design lifetime was 10 years.  Jim
Hylen says the warranty has expired.  But recent press reports say
it is ok to use most food well after the package's "use by" date.
On 15 Jan NuMI switched to 4+6 slip stacking and is currently
running at 460 kW.  It is now expected to reach 575 kW by the end
of February and to demonstrate 700 kW before the summer shutdown.
