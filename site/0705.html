*** Report of the U.S. long-baseline neutrino experiment study
</H1> <P>
This study, led by G. Rameika and M. Diwan was sponsored by
Fermilab and Brookhaven.  The report is at 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.4396"> arXiv:0705.4396 </A>
The study compares beam options - NuMI on-axis, NuMI off-axis 1st 
maximum, NuMI 2nd maximum, WBB to DUSEL and detector options
Water Cerenkov Detector and Liquid Argon.

*** NOvA gets Critical Decision One (CD1)
</H1> <P>
The Neutrino Oscillation nu-e Appearance Experiment at FNAL had
its CD1 Review last year, but it takes a while, sometimes, for 
bureaucrats to sign things.  This involved, in part, the procedure 
for a far detector site in Northern Minnesota.  A large 18 kton 
detector will be built there.  The NOvA "Lehman" review for 
CD2/CD3a is scheduled for July 17.

*** NuSAG studying future accelerator neutrino options

With a charge, "Assuming a megawatt class proton accelerator as a 
neutrino source, please answer the following questions for 
accelerator-detector configurations including those needed for a 
multi-phase off-axis program and a very-long-baseline broad-band 
program." and the questions involved scientific potential, 
detector options, cost, schedule and international context.
A report to HEPAP is due soon.  One intriguing statement is
"One strategic issue seems clear: can't start construction on 
Phase 2 without an observation of non-zero theta-13"

A set of goals for High Energy Physics were approved by the
HEPAP in Dec 06.  The neutrino goal (1 of 6) is the most specific.   
It is "Determine the pattern of the neutrino masses and the 
details of their mixing parameters."   & 1.) Confirm or refute 
evidence for additional neutrino species (referring to LSND & now 
probably 'met'); 2.) Confirm or rule out the current picture of 
atmospheric neutrino oscillations (already 'met'); 3) Measure 
Delta msquared-32 to 15% (needs 7.5e20 pot for MINOS); 4) Measure 
non-zero value for sin^2(2 theta13) or constrain < 0.06(90%CL)-
(Double Chooz will meet by 2010 & Daya Bay will exceed by 2014).

*** NSF decision on DUSEL (Deep Lab) may come in June
</H1> <P>

DUSEL proposals have been made by Cascades, Henderson, Homestake 
and Soudan.  This news article describes the project as $300M for 
300 scientists.  (These numbers may be low?).  DUSEL-Cascades has 
made their materials available http://www.int.washington.edu/s3/.

*** Nufact Summer School & NNN07 in Japan
</H1> <P>
The 6th International School on Neutrino Factories, Superbeams and 
Betabeams will be in  Tsukuba (Japan) 27 Jul - 4 Aug 2007.

The
workshop on Next generation Nucleon Decay and Neutrino Detectors
2007 (NNN07) will be in Hamamatsu City 2-5 Oct 07.

*** Prediction for Theta-13
</H1> <P>
In "CKM and Tri-bimaximal MNS Matrices in a SU(5) x (d)T Model", 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.0714"> arXiv:0705.0714 </A>

Chen & Mahanthappa find a sum rule tan^2(theta_12) 
= tan^2(theta_12,TBM)-theta_c/2*cos(beta), where the correction 
from the charged lepton sector (the second term) is related to the 
Cabibbo angle and it could account for the difference between the 
experimental best fit value and prediction of the tri-bimaximal 
mixing matrix. The prediction for theta_13 ~ theta_c / (3 sqrt[2]) 
~ 0.05, may be accessible to the reactor experiments.

*** T2K (Tokai to Super-Kamiokande neutrino beam) progress  
</H1> <P>
Construction of the Target Station (TS) is going on, which follows 
the 200m-long extraction beam tunnel and will contain the horn and 
target. The bottom part of the TS is being constructed. The 
installation of the frame structure which will serve as a Helium 
vessel will be installed in August.  The 1st horn test, started Dec
06 has recently finished.  This was excited by a 320 kA pulse peak
current and total pulses reached 850,000.  There was a small water
leak (fixed). The 3rd horn was completed and delivered to KEK. 
This 3rd horn will be tested in series with the 1st one.

*** Beta Beam Progress (from Mandate at 
<A href="http://cern.ch/beta-beam"> http://cern.ch/beta-beam</A>)
</H1> <P>
A Beta Beam task force maintains a web page 
<A href="http://cern.ch/beta-beam"> http://cern.ch/beta-beam</A>.
The acceleration of high intensity, radioactive ion beams to 
highest energies requires novel design solutions. The objective is 
to do a Conceptual Design Study (CDS), covering all accelerator 
physics aspects, to demonstrate the feasibility of a Beta Beam 
facility. The final report will contain: the optics design of the 
accelerator chain, beam dynamic simulations of critical processes, 
a loss management concept, first stage technical designs 
demonstrating the feasibility of critical hardware, a facility 
layout and a cost estimate. The combination of EURISOL with a Beta 
Beam would make optimum use of the enormous potential synergies 
and give a world class facility attracting not only the nuclear, 
but also neutrino and particle physics communities.
