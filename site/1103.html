*** Note from KEK sent out just after the earthquake
</H1> <P>
"Japan experienced very severe earthquake on 11 Mar 11 at 14:46.
J-PARC facility suffered damages for some extent.  There are no 
reports of casualties and all staff, graduate students and foreign
visitors have been located and as of evening 13 Mar all T2K 
members have been evacuated from Tokai.  Fortunately the Tsunami
tidal wave did not hit J-PARC.  We will start the investigation
of the facilities.  We will updated the announcement as we learn
the detail of the entire damage.  Our present priority is to 
restore life-supporting infrastructure such as electricity, water
supply and gas at J-PARC.  It may take some time, but we promise
the full recovery of the J-PARC accelerator and T2K experiment in
the near future.  We thank you for the messages of solidarity and
sympathy."  Director of the Institute of Particle and Nuclear 
Studies, KEK Koichiro Nishikawa & Spokesperson of the T2K
experiment, Takashi Kobayashi

*** News about damage and progress at JPARC
</H1> <P>
The extent of the damage to J-PARC was updated on 29 Mar.  See
<A href="http://kds.kek.jp/materialDisplay.py?materialId=0&confId=6810"> 
http://kds.kek.jp/materialDisplay.py?materialId=0&confId=6810  </a> You
will be asked to enter the ID/password shown pop-up.  Although
J-PARC and the neighboring nuclear reactor are along the beach,
they were designed for a 10 m tsunami and it was 3 m there.  The
earthquake damaged roads, infrastructure and buildings at J-PARC,
& there was a few cm of water in some places.  Electricity for 
lights are on for the Main Ring, Neutrino, Hadron & MLF.  A
proposal for the "1st urgent budget request" to the government is 
done, and a 2nd request is due mid May after more assessment.

*** Can neutrinos be used to predict earthquakes?
</H1> <P>
Probably not, but the neutrino group sees an intriguing sharp drop
in the vertical elevation at Tokai in the few days before the 
earthquake in two GPS units.  No change is seen at Super-K.  Look
at the last slide in the previous item.

*** Fire in the Soudan shaft 
</H1> <P>
The MINOS experiment is in a lab a half mile underground.  A fire 
occurred on 17 Mar in the evening while no-one was in the lab
<A href="http://news.dnr.state.mn.us/index.php/2011/03/18/fire-underway-in-mine-shaft-at-soudan-underground-mine-state-park/"> 
http://news.dnr.state.mn.us/index.php/2011/03/18/fire-underway-in-mine-shaft-at-soudan-underground-mine-state-park/
</a>  The fire system automatically cut power to MINOS, which wasn't
running due to a target replacement anyway.   Foam was poured down
the shaft to put the fire out.  When staff returned to the 
underground lab, there was no visible fire or smoke damage. 
However, the fire doors to the MINOS Lab were pushed open and the 
MINOS Lab has significant quantities of foam and debris from the 
north end to the MINOS Detector.   At the Detector, the foam 
reached as high as about a foot below the Detector core hole but
was below the readout electronics.  Power has been restored for pumps 
and lights.   The cause of the fire will be announced after an 
investigation.  Some infrastructure in the shaft needs replacement.

*** New neutrino oscillation parameter from MINOS
</H1> <P>
A new more accurate value of dmsq_32 from MINOS for 7.2e20 pot
was presented at Neutrino 2010.  The previous published result 
was 3.4e20 pot.  The larger data set has now been submitted for 
publication, and global fitters should notice a change from the
Nu10 value.  Now 2.32 +0.12 -0.08 10^(-3) eV^2.

*** Maurice Goldhaber will turn 100 on April 18, 2011
</H1> <P>
The discoverer that the neutrino has negative helicity will have 
his 100th (yes, 100th!) birthday on 18 Apr.  In lieu of a public 
gathering and/or party, his family wishes to accept e-mails, which 
may include a photo, from his friends and colleagues to celebrate.
Please send something by 4/18 to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="afcec3c9ddcacb81c8c0c3cbc7cecdcaddefdcdbc0c1d6cdddc0c0c481cacbda">[email&#160;protected]</a>.

*** Nobel Prize winner Van der Meer designed the neutrino horn
</H1> <P>
Simon van der Meer, who recently passed away, got the Nobel Prize
for Stochastic Cooling, but also invented the "horn", the focusing
device used in neutrino experiments.  I was originally planning
to devote this newsletter to horn stories, but ran out of space.
Please share with me any "horn" stories for a future newsletter.

*** MAP approved
</H1> <P>
The Muon Accelerator Program Management plan was signed on 14 Mar
by Acting Associate Director for High Energy Physics Mike 
Procario.  Steve Geer (FNAL) and Michael Zisman (LBNL) are 
codirectors for this accelerator R&D program in the U.S.

*** Chang Kee Jung elected T2K co-spokesperson
</H1> <P>
Stony Brook's Chang Kee Jung was elected in February as 
International Co-Spokesperson of the T2K long-baseline neutrino 
experiment.  He replaced David Wark from Imperial College.  The 
(~500 member) T2K collaboration votes on this position.

*** Bruno Pontecorvo Prize awarded to Prof. Yoichuro Suzuki
</H1> <P>
The prestigious 2010 Bruno Pontecorvo Prize has been awarded to 
Prof. Y. Suzuki, the director of Kamioka Observatory, for his 
outstanding contribution to the discovery of atmospheric and solar 
neutrino oscillations in the Super-Kamiokande experiment.  The 
Pontecorvo Prize has been awarded annually since 1995 by the Joint 
Institute for Nuclear Research(JINR) in Dubna to scientists who 
have achieved outstanding results in particle physics.
