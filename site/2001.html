*** Hyper-Kamiokande moving forward
</H1> <P>
The Hyper-Kamiokande project is for a 190 kiloton fiducial mass
water detector with 40,000 photosensors, and a plan to upgrade
J-PARC to 1.3 MW.  A 2019
supplementary budget of 3.13 BJPY for HK and .37 BJPY for J-PARC
upgrade and FY20 .3BJPY (out of requested 1.8 BJPY) is proposed by
the Japanese cabinet.  Total cost = 72 BJPY.  Construction will
start in 2020 & operation in 2027.

*** Did a presidential candidate's grandfather work in a nu lab?
</H1> <P>
During a recent debate, Amy Klobuchar mentioned her grandfather
worked underground in an iron mine in Ely Minnesota.  Was it the
Soudan mine, where the Soudan I, Soudan 2 and MINOS experiments
studied neutrinos?  Probably not.  The 520 m deep Pioneer mine is
a more likely answer.

*** Number of neutrinos creeping toward three
</H1> <P>
The width of the Z boson at LEP convinced the community that there
were three and only three light "active" neutrinos.  However, the
four measurements by ALEPH, DELPHI, L3 and OPAL were all two sigma
below 3.  But a recent analysis of beam-beam effects on the fully
correlated luminosity measurement due to a bias of luminometer
acceptance found a correction twice the previous systematic error.
N_nu = 2.9918 +- 0.0081.

*** UK promises 65 million pounds for neutrino research at FNAL
</H1> <P>

https://news.fnal.gov/2020/01/uk-invests-65-million-in-international-science-projects-hosted-by-fermilab/

The UK investments in DUNE and related projects at FNAL will
empower UK scientists and institutions to maintain a world
leader position in research for years to come.

*** Neutrinos are not illusive
</H1> <P>
Are neutrinos deceptive?  That's the meaning of illusive.  I don't
think so.  They propagate in well defined mass eigenstates & seem
to interact with a calculable V-A interaction.  But it is in a
headline in SURF's "Deep Thoughts", which came from an article
about John Marshall from Warwick and his work on DUNE, appearing
in the UK's "Lab News".  John used "elusive" in the article.  The 
journal caught the mistake, but there was poor communication with 
production.  The web version is now fixed.

Of particular
interest will be the required effort for:  the HPgTPC and its
pressure vessel, the magnet system and the muon tagger/ID system.

*** "Compressed Pulses from the ESS" in Uppsala 2-3 March
</H1> <P>
<A href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/849674/">
https://indico.cern.ch/event/849674/

The European Spallation
Source (ESS) being built will be 5 MW of 2 GeV protons delivered
in 14 2.86 ms long pulses per second.  This Uppsala workshop is
sponsored by ESSNSB (ESS Neutrino Super Beam).

This working meeting will
identify the critical steps in a design study towards an initial
machine operating at 3 TeV center-of-mass energy. It aims to
develop a new international collaboration towards this goal.

<H1>
*** Gathering of Neutrino Theorists 11-13 May 2020 near D.C.
</H1> <P>
As the field of neutrino physics enters the precision era, nus are
ubiquitous and yet retain many mysteries, key to Particle physics,
Astrophysics, and Nuclear physics. The time is right for an
interdisciplinary effort of theorists to analyze the status of the
field and make a plan for the future.  The inaugural PAN Neutrino
Theory Symposium will be held Virginia Tech's Arlington Research
Center.

*** RANT - Names on published papers
</H1> <P>
My brother-in-law once expressed surprise that an unreasonable
fraction of papers in "Notable New References" were written by
people whose last name began with "A".  (I've since switched to
listing collaborations when I can.)  In the field of particle
physics, many don't read a majority of their own papers.  Each
collaboration has their own arcane rules.  This is a problem
without a right answer, but it is a problem nonetheless.
