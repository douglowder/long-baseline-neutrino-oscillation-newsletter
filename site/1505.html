*** Hyper-K Memorandum
</H1> <P>
KEK-IPNS and Tokyo-ICRR have signed a Memorandum of Understanding
for cooperation in the promotion of the Hyper-Kamiokande
experiment.  A proto-collaboration has formed with 240 members
from 13 countries.  KEK and ICRR have requested a design report
which will be prepared for a budget request in 2015.  A master
plan from the Science Council of Japan and a roadmap from MEXT
will be prepared in 2016-17.

*** First antineutrino results from T2K
</H1> <P>
The first running of antineutrinos in the Tokai to Kamiokande
experiment shows a clear dip below 1 GeV as is expected for an
oscillation signal.  The best fit for sin^2(q) is 0.515 + 0.085
- 0.095 and for dmsq_32 is 2.33 +.27 -.23 e-3 eV^2.

*** Testbeam at Lariat
</H1> <P>
Accelerator operators have begun using a revived beamline to send
particles to LArIAT, Liquid Argon TPC in a Test Beam, which will
advance particle detector technologies for neutrino experiments.

*** MicroBoone
</H1> <P>
Shifts have begun on the MicroBooNE experiment, which has built a
liquid argon detector in the Booster beamline.  They have started
cooling down and will start filling with liquid Argon soon.  An
increase in readout noise for ~1% of the wires led to need for
inspection inside the detector.  In April there were photos taken
with a clever camera-mirror-lighting arrangement but all was found
to be in order to proceed with filling.  Meanwhile the horn in the
booster beamline, which had run for years for MiniBooNE, has been
replaced.

*** White paper from INO
</H1> <P>
The upcoming 50 kt magnetized iron calorimeter (ICAL) detector at
the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) is designed to study
the atmospheric neutrinos and antineutrinos separately over a wide
range of energies and path lengths. The primary focus is to explore
matter effects by observing the energy and zenith angle dependence
of the atmospheric neutrinos in the multi-GeV range.  They outline
the analyses carried out for the determination of neutrino mass
hierarchy and precision measurements of atmospheric neutrino mixing
parameters at ICAL, and give the expected physics reach of the
detector with 10 years of runtime. They also explore the potential of
ICAL for probing new physics scenarios like CPT violation and the
presence of magnetic monopoles.

*** 25 June event to mark start of ionization cooling by MICE
</H1> <P>
On the 25th June 2015 the STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory is
hosting an event to mark the start of the study of ionization
cooling with the international Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment
(MICE).  Ionization cooling is the technique by which it is
proposed to reduce the mu-beam phase space in a future nu factory
or mu collider.

*** US and European Scientists Sign Cooperation Pact
</H1> <P>
It's a step forward for the neutrino world because, as noted by CERN
director-general Rolf Heuer, "it formalizes CERN's participation in
U.S.-based programs such as prospective future neutrino facilities."

*** How to get a Nobel Prize for neutrinos, is it for the money?
</H1> <P>
One of the 3 Nobel Prizes awarded for the discovery of the muon
neutrino was put up for auction and sold for $765,002.

*** Public meeting 24 June for the DUNE/LBNF project (free)
</H1> <P>
The U.S. DOE is hosting a public meeting at FNAL on 24 June, 6:30-
8:30 p.m. to gather comments on the preliminary findings of the
related environmental studies. It will provide information on the
planned facility and the expected environmental impacts as shown
in a Draft Environmental Assessment that's been prepared pursuant
to the National Environmental Policy Act. There will be short
presentations, posters, and the opportunity to ask questions and
submit comments.  The public comment period for the environmental
assessment begins on 8 June and runs until 10 July.

*** Lee Grodzins postdoctoral award honors neutrino postdoc
</H1> <P>
Nominations are due 15 July for this award created to recognize
Grodzins who performed groundbreaking measurements of the helicity
of the neutrino with Maurice Goldhaber in 1957.
