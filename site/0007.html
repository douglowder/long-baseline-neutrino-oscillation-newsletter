*** Donut reports discovery of tau neutrino
</h1>
The beam dump experiment at Fermilab reports 203 neutrino events,
of which 4 events survive tau cuts in the Long decay search.  The
expected number based on the calculated cross section and
efficiencies is 4.1 +- 1.4.  The background is .41 +- .15 events,
half charm and half hadronic interactions.   The preliminary
report of 5 events at Nu2000 included a short decay analysis.

*** Kolar Event type anomaly in NuTeV
</h1>
NuTeV put a Helium bag in front of their detector to search for
verticizing events from Neutral Heavy Lepton or Neutralino decay.
A "blind" analysis found 3 dimuon events (0 others), with expected
background of only 0.04 dimuons, or 0.30 events total in 2
charged particles.  But the asymmetry in the 3 events fits Deep
Inelastic Scattering, and &lt;0.5% likely from decay.

*** New K2K data
</h1>
K2K showed their deficit in OD (outer detector) events but didn't
include that deficit in quoting a statistical significance.
Their position is that  OD events are useful for checking the
consistency with FC events, but they are less well understood and
the systematic error, due to OD timing cut, may be large, when
they start discussing oscillations quantitatively.  Exiting events
with vertex in fiducial volume will be helpful after ICHEP(OSAKA).

<p> </p><h1>
*** Large Ue3?
</h1>
If Ue3 is 10^-3 or less, a neutrino factory won't see much CP
violation or matter effects.   Chooz constrains Ue3 to &lt;~0.2 , but
long-baseline experiments will increase the search sensitivity.  A
recent paper by Akhmedov et al. suggests that in the absence of
fine-tuning of the neutrino mass matrix, the LMA solar neutrino solution
points towards a nicely large value, 0.05-0.15.  (PRL 84/16 p3535)
This is also discussed in
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0007029"> hep-ph/0007029 </a>
and
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0006281"> hep-ph/0006281 </a>.
Others impose new symmetries so Ue3=0., as in
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0007011"> hep-ph/0007011 </a>.

*** Neutrino Preparations for Snowmass 2001
</h1>
The "neutrinos with mass" workshop led to some organization of
neutrino physicists in preparation for Snowmass 2001, where
community input on future facilities will be in focus.  A web
page for that effort has been organized by Jeff Wilkes at
<a href="http://www.phys.washington.edu/~wilkes/NNO/">
http://www.phys.washington.edu/~wilkes/NNO/.  </a>
A table there
compares the physics goals of present and future experiments.
Input is welcome.

*** Whaddya Know? www.notmuch.com
</h1>
Comedian Michael Feldman took on neutrinos under Wisconsin in
the 6/10 edition of his radio program and also a newspaper column.
He points out, "...you don't have to be Rand-McNally to know that
Illinois is a good long state.  Couldn't they point the thing to
Carbondale and get in  450 miles?"  Some physicists complained
about this attempt at humor, but I am sympathetic to such
attempts.  See
<a href="http://www.notmuch.com/Show/2000/06.10.html">

*** MINOS lowers baseline initial beam Energy
</h1>
Probably not in response to Michael Feldman's concerns, MINOS has
chosen to switch to the "low energy beam" rather than the "medium
energy beam" as the probable initial beam energy.  For favored
values of delta m^2, this centers the oscillations more on the
beam spectrum.  The parabolic horns can be moved to focus
differing energies, but other hardware such as monitoring need
specifications which depend on beam energy.

*** South Pole Daily Nus
</h1>
I don't know what they are reading in Antarctica, but the AMANDA
experiment now shows data from 1997 run of AMANDA-B with signal
and background for 18 cut levels, trading off efficiency (for
source searches) for background rejection (atmospheric neutrino
flux.)   The rate of analyzed atmo nus is about one per day.

*** Workshop on Neutrino Beams and Instrumentation
</h1>
The 2nd International Workshop on Nu Beams will be held at Fermilab
from 6-9 September 2000.  The workshop is aimed at conventional
beams.  See

*** Nuclear Physics Neutrino Workshop 21-23 September
</h1>
In anticipation of the Town Meetings on the Long Range Plan
for Nuclear Physics a Neutrino Workshop will be held in Seattle
Sep 21-23

*** High Intensity Neutrino Beams
</h1>
A new physics study is being conducted on the neutrino physics
potential of the first stage of a neutrino factory, an intense
hadron beam together with a conventional neutrino beam.  Calling
them "superbeams", the study is being led by FNAL's Debbie Harris.

*** LOI for JHF and Super-K
</h1>
A JHF Neutrino Working Group organized by K. Nishikawa has
submitted a Letter of Intent for a long-baseline neutrino
oscillation experiment using the JHF 50 GeV machine and Super-K.
The JHF is planned for Jaeri, 295 km from Super-K.  With 10^21
protons on target (per half year) they expect 6000 neutrinos with
a Wide Band Beam, 1500 with a NBB, both much more than K2K.
