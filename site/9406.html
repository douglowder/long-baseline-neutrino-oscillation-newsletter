</p><h1>Fermilab PAC endorses joint short baseline/long baseline</h1>
At the JUNE Fermilab PAC meeting, the decision was made to press
ahead with a joint short/long-baseline beam for the year 2000.
If approved by DOE, they would submit the project to Congress
for FY1998 funding in January of 1997.   A five page letter from
John Peoples outlining Fermilab's neutrino program for the year
2000 and beyond was handed out at the SNOWMASS workshop.
<p>
</p><h1>Soudan site favored</h1>
Soudan and IMB were preferred over surface locations.  "...the
Soudan mine appears to have a number of significant features to
recommend it" they wrote, including
<ul>
<li>optimal L/E for the PAC goals,
</li><li> established infrastructure,
</li><li> usable detector.
</li></ul>
"Based on these considerations, the committee recommends the
Soudan mine as the initial focus of investigation for the far
detector site."
<p>
</p><h1>Schedule for long baseline (LBL) experiments specified:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Snowmass 1994: Discussions for merging collaborations
</li><li>November 1994: preliminary discussion at PAC
</li><li>February 1995: Letter of Intent (submitted in January)
</li><li>June 1995: beamline full proposal and LBL proposal
</li><li>summer 1995 (if approved): conceptual design starts
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><h1>Revision 1 to Fermilab NuMI beam to Soudan saves $10M</h1>
The revised short/long baseline beam design costs $35.7M, about
$10M less than revision 0.  An accelerated construction schedule
was also given, adding $3.3M saving 4.5 months in construction time.
<p>
</p><h1>ICARUS proceeding</h1>
At the Snowmass opening talk on neutrino oscillations, the goals
of the ICARUS project were reviewed by J. Revol.  The cost was
given as 62 Million Swiss F. Serious consideration at CERN is also
being given to the beam.
<p>
</p><h1>Snowmass</h1>
Short baseline meetings are July 5th to July 9th.  Long Baseline
meetings are July 8th to July 12th.  The Long baseline group is
attempting to write a white paper on opportunities for Long
baseline oscillations.
No atmospheric neutrino sessions were originally scheduled, but
now one has been added for the morning of July 7th. (Group N24)
<p>
</p><h1>LSND and Karmen on numu to nue oscillations</h1>
At Neutrino 94, LSND showed their preliminary data, including an
apparent excess of events (9 events with a background of 1) in a
mode which could be numu to nue oscillations.  If so, the
oscillation probability is about 1%.  Karmen (at the Rutherford
ISIS beam) showed data which seemed to contradict that
conclusion by a factor of 3 at high delta m-squared.  There was
discussion (no graph) as to whether it could be where LSND's
sensitivity wiggles to the left while Karmen's goes right.
<p>
</p><h1>Kamiokande 7.7 kT-year and charged particle test results</h1>
At neutrino '94 Kamiokande's atmospheric results grew from 6.2
to 7.7 kT year.  They now have 234 mu-fits, 248 e-like events; R
= .60 + .06 - .05 (Honda flux); .61 + .06 - .05 (Gaisser flux).
Of greater interest were prelim  results at 3 energies from their
charged particle test beam.  Mu's look like mu's and e's look
like e's as predicted by their Monte Carlo.
<p>
</p><h1>New reactor limits </h1>
Two new reactor experimental results further limit numu to nue.
The BUGAY-3 group has pushed dm^2 at maximal mixing down to
10^-2 eV^2 and the Krasnoyarsk reactor (below) to 8 * 10^-3.
The best previous limit from Gosgen was 2.3 * 10^-2.  Together
with the 7.7 kT-yr Kamioka analysis, there is no "allowed"
region left for numu-nue at 90% CL for everyone.
