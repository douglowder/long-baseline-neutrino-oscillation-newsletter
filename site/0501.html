*** First NuMI event
</h1>
On January 21, 2005, during the first running of the NuMI beam at
Fermilab with the target in, the first neutrinos were observed in
the MINOS near detector.  Timing, vertex, and angular distributions
of the first event, and others that have followed, give confidence
that these are real beam neutrinos.   Many worked hard to make
this happen, but congratulations should be sent to the MINOS
spokespersons Doug Michael (
), Stan
Wojcicki (

and Beam Coordinator
Robert Plunkett (



<p> </p><h1>
*** Fermilab neighbor web site
</h1>
As neutrinos start to make their way from Fermilab under
Wisconsin to Minnesota, Fermilab expects some additional interest
from citizens along the way.  A web site has been put together
for them at
<a href="http://www.fnal.gov/neutrinos"> http://www.fnal.gov/neutrinos </a>


<p> </p><h1>
*** NuMI dedication planned
</h1>
Fermilab knows how to party, so the dedication of the NuMI
facility is an excellent reason to do so.  It is being planned
for Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House of Representatives to be
present, so the date is not yet certain but the first week of
March is a strong possibility.  The new Secretary of Energy
Samuel Bodman was sworn in on February 1st and there is a good
chance that he will come as well.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Young MINOS
</h1>
Young people, such as postdocs and graduate students will do much
of the analysis work on MINOS.  Young representatives have
recently been added to the MINOS institutional board and the
MINOS executive committee.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Proton Driver CD0
</h1>
The DOE might issue a site non-specific CD0 for a proton driver.
CD0 is a bureaucratic prerequisite for future funding and
constitutes a statement of mission need.  Ideas for a proton
driver, motivated by neutrinos, are being developed at BNL &amp; FNAL.

<p> </p><h1>
*** What's Driving the proton driver?
</h1>
A draft report from the proton driver working group at Fermilab
will be out soon.  There was a workshop at Fermilab where it was
the consensus that the future neutrino program at Fermilab was
the main motivation for a proton driver which could increase the
proton intensity at Fermilab.  There are other motivations as
well, including Kaon physics, muon physics, etc.  The working
group has a web page at
<a href="http://protondriver.fnal.gov/"> http://protondriver.fnal.gov/.  </a>
They have
recently moved their meetings to Wednesdays at 2:00.

<p> </p><h1>
*** NOvA goes totally active
</h1>
The NOvA collaboration which has submitted a proposal for a large
off-axis experiment in the NuMI beam has decided to adopt a
Totally Active Scintillation Detector (TASD) based on liquid
scintillator for the upcoming update to its proposal.  An
election is also being held for two co-spokespersons.  The two
candidates are John Cooper (Fermilab) and Gary Feldman (Harvard).

<p> </p><h1>
*** A surprise for the new Fermilab Director
</h1>
The new Fermilab Director is alleged to have made a statement
like the following: "You mean there's an off-axis beam about to
turn on at Fermilab, and there is no off-axis detector to see it?"

*** NUFACT05 June 21-26 in Rome.
</h1>
Neutrino factories aren't yet in anybody's budget, but NUFACT
meetings seem to be where a lot of neutrino physics planning is
done.
<a href="http://www.lnf.infn.it/conference/2005/nufact05/">
http://www.lnf.infn.it/conference/2005/nufact05/
</a>
This year's meeting is planned at Frascati.  The fourth NUFACT
summer institute will be June 12-20 in Capri, Italy near Naples.

they are a degenerate gas and possess a magnetic moment.  The
