*** First NuMI event
</h1>
On January 21, 2005, during the first running of the NuMI beam at 
Fermilab with the target in, the first neutrinos were observed in 
the MINOS near detector.  Timing, vertex, and angular distributions 
of the first event, and others that have followed, give confidence 
that these are real beam neutrinos.   Many worked hard to make 
this happen, but congratulations should be sent to the MINOS 
spokespersons Doug Michael (

*** Fermilab neighbor web site
</h1>
As neutrinos start to make their way from Fermilab under 
Wisconsin to Minnesota, Fermilab expects some additional interest 
from citizens along the way.  A web site has been put together 
for them at 
<a href="http://www.fnal.gov/neutrinos"> http://www.fnal.gov/neutrinos </a>


<p> <h1>
*** NuMI dedication planned
</h1>
Fermilab knows how to party, so the dedication of the NuMI 
facility is an excellent reason to do so.  It is being planned 
for Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House of Representatives to be 
present, so the date is not yet certain but the first week of 
March is a strong possibility.  The new Secretary of Energy 
Samuel Bodman was sworn in on February 1st and there is a good 
chance that he will come as well.

<p> <h1>
*** Young MINOS
</h1>
Young people, such as postdocs and graduate students will do much 
of the analysis work on MINOS.  Young representatives have 
recently been added to the MINOS institutional board and the 
MINOS executive committee.  

<p> <h1>
*** Proton Driver CD0
</h1>
The DOE might issue a site non-specific CD0 for a proton driver.  
CD0 is a bureaucratic prerequisite for future funding and 
constitutes a statement of mission need.  Ideas for a proton 
driver, motivated by neutrinos, are being developed at BNL & FNAL.

<p> <h1>
*** What's Driving the proton driver?
</h1>
A draft report from the proton driver working group at Fermilab 
will be out soon.  There was a workshop at Fermilab where it was 
the consensus that the future neutrino program at Fermilab was 
the main motivation for a proton driver which could increase the 
proton intensity at Fermilab.  There are other motivations as 
well, including Kaon physics, muon physics, etc.  The working 
group has a web page at 
<a href="http://protondriver.fnal.gov/"> http://protondriver.fnal.gov/.  </a>
They have 
recently moved their meetings to Wednesdays at 2:00.

<p> <h1>
*** NOvA goes totally active
</h1>
The NOvA collaboration which has submitted a proposal for a large 
off-axis experiment in the NuMI beam has decided to adopt a 
Totally Active Scintillation Detector (TASD) based on liquid 
scintillator for the upcoming update to its proposal.  An 
election is also being held for two co-spokespersons.  The two 
candidates are John Cooper (Fermilab) and Gary Feldman (Harvard).

<p> <h1>
*** A surprise for the new Fermilab Director
</h1>
The new Fermilab Director is alleged to have made a statement 
like the following: "You mean there's an off-axis beam about to 
turn on at Fermilab, and there is no off-axis detector to see it?"

*** NUFACT05 June 21-26 in Rome.
</h1>
Neutrino factories aren't yet in anybody's budget, but NUFACT 
meetings seem to be where a lot of neutrino physics planning is 
done.  
<a href="http://www.lnf.infn.it/conference/2005/nufact05/"> 
http://www.lnf.infn.it/conference/2005/nufact05/
</a>
This year's meeting is planned at Frascati.  The fourth NUFACT 
summer institute will be June 12-20 in Capri, Italy near Naples.
