<H1>Long-Baseline news, July 2019 </H1> <P>

<H1> *** Nishikawa fest at KEK 27 Sep 2019 13:30-17:30 </H1> <P> Koichiro 
Nishikawa (1949-2018) pioneered long-baseline neutrino oscillation 
experiments as the founder of the K2K experiment and the first 
spokesperson of T2K.  He has been recognized for his contributions as 
Director of the KEK Institute of Particle and Nuclear Studies, Deputy 
Director of J-PARC Center and a professor at Kyoto University.  A 
symposium to celebrate his career will be 13:30-17:30 27 Sep, at KEK 
Tsukuba Campus.  There is no fee. 
<A href="https://conference-indico.kek.jp/indico/event/81/"> https://conference-indico.kek.jp/indico/event/81/.  
</A> 
From 18:30, a 
gathering in his memory will be at Hotel Grand Shinonome, with a 10,000 
yen fee.  A bus will be arranged.  Register by 30 Aug. This symposium 
follows the J-PARC Symposium, 23-26 Sep 2019.

<H1> *** ANNIE installed at Fermilab </H1> <P> The Accelerator Neutrino 
Neutron Interaction Experiment (ANNIE) is now installed at Fermilab and 
beginning its commissioning process in preparation for beam this fall.  
ANNIE will perform a detailed measurement of neutron yields from 
nu-nucleus interactions in H2O. This measurement will aid in better 
understanding reconstruction of E_nu for future long-baseline neutrino 
analyses and also in developing neutron tagging for proton decay and 
Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB) searches. In addition, ANNIE 
will be the first neutrino experiment to demonstrate newly commercialized 
Large Area Picosecond Photodetectors (LAPPDs) and the first demonstration 
of Gadolinium-loaded water on a neutrino beam.

<H1> *** MiniBoone turned off for the last time </H1> <P> At 11 am on 
Wednesday 17 July, the MiniBooNE detector was turned off for the last 
time.  It had run for many years in the Fermilab Booster beam with many 
interesting results on nus and Dark Matter.

<H1> *** RANT - Effective neutrino masses are not masses </H1> <P> A new 
newsletter feature will be rants about a nu physics topic. I've done this 
before, but more rants are coming, now with labels. 
<br>
---Direct mass & 
0nu2beta experiments will measure or limit a mixture of nu masses & mixing 
angles which are called effective masses, or sometimes the nue mass.  
Each one is a parameter that the experiment can measure that has units of 
mass & is related to the 3 actual masses.  But the number is not the mass 
of anything. It is not an m that you can put into the vacuum Schrodinger 
equation for the nue.  The nue does not have a mass. If you try to 
conserve both E & p, you violate the uncertainty principle.

<H1> *** Change in Planck's constant, h </H1> <P> The uncertainty 
principle depends on Planck's constant which has a new value in May 2019.  
Actually h didn't change.  It's constant after all, or at least we think 
it is.  What changed, slightly, was the definition of the units that it is 
made up of.  h is now exactly 6.6260693e-34 joule-s.  You know this wasn't 
driven by neutrino physicists.  We would have defined hbar = h/(2 pi). In 
the 2017 RPP it was given as 6.626070040(81)e-34 J-s.

<H1> *** The NuSTEC Workshop on Shallow- and Deep-Inelastic Scattering 
</H1> <P> Instead of publishing proceedings, the organizers of this Oct. 
2018 workshop have made available an annotated proceedings. 
<A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13252"> 
https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13252 
</A> 
The presentations are available with 
links.  This makes so much more sense than proceedings.

<H1> *** Neutrino mass upper limits from cosmology </H1> <P> Many 
cosmological nu mass bounds assume degenerate masses, which is not a good 
approximation.  Choudhury & Hannestad have updated sum(m) limits 
separately for different orders in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12598"> arXiv:1907.12598. </A> 
 95% C.L. upper limits are 145 meV(normal), 170 
meV(inverted), and 122 meV (degenerate).  Lower limits come from 
oscillations.

<H1> *** Jack Schneps, 1929-2019 </H1> 
<P> Jack, an International Neutrino 
Commission member, was one of the 1st advocates of an FNAL long-baseline 
program.  HEP leader at Tufts, he was part of "The Department that Built a 
University".

<H1> *** Ernst Otten, 1934-2019 </H1> <P> From Johannes Gutenberg 
University Mainz, he pioneered the Mainz neutrino mass experiment and was 
a collaborator on Katrin.
