*** T2K sees first neutrinos
</H1> <P>
Events from the new neutrino beam at J-PARC have been detected in 
the T2K near detector.  They were seen in "Interactive Neutrino 
GRID detectors" (INGRID), a neutrino beam monitor for the beam 
profile which was installed in August.  These first events were 
seen 24 Nov 09.  T2K expects to begin physics running in January, 
using the Super-Kamiokande (far) detector.  The director of KEK 
correctly stated, "Researchers around the world must be jealous 
that once again neutrinos seem to like to reveal new properties in 
Japan!"

*** LHC fails to see first neutrinos
</H1> <P>

Neutrinos 
made by the LHC's 1st collisions went undetected.  There is little 
connection between the Higgs search and flavor physics, but
occasionally some Higgs model predicts a connection to neutrinos.
Supersymmetry advocates ignored neutrinos until the evidence for 
nu mass was compelling, and then they used it as an additional 
motivation for Supersymmetry.  In the US, we need to interest more 
collider experimentalists in neutrinos.  There is a "Working Group 
on the Interplay between Collider and Flavor Physics" CERN meeting 
14-16 Dec.

*** We only have until Dec 21 "2012" to measure theta_13
</H1> <P>
In this Mayan calendar motivated new movie, neutrinos may be quite
dangerous, "...a monster solar flare shoots invisible neutrinos 
into the earth's core, cooking it like a Hot Pocket.  The seas 
rise.  Tectonic plates shuffle.  Volcanoes erupt. ..."

*** SciNOvA Expression of Interest at November FNAL PAC
</H1> <P>
They propose to re-instrument the scintillator from SciBooNE and 
deploy the detector in front of the NOvA near detector where it 
will be exposed to the 2 GeV NuMI narrow-band beam.  The detector 
would consist of 15,000 scintillator bars that would provide a 
fine-grained detector to measure quasi-elastic scattering, 
neutral-current elastic scattering, neutral-current pizero 
production, and enhance the NOvA measurements of electron neutrino 
appearance and muon neutrino disappearance.  The Fermilab PAC 
responded favorably to the EoI and recommends the proponents 
clarify/expand on the complementarity and synergy with MINERvA 
and how it would help the NOvA understand its off-axis beam.

*** INO has to find a new site for its neutrino observatory
</H1> <P>
The Indian Neutrino Observatory (INO) collaboration has received
a letter from India's minister of environment and forests telling 
them to find an alternate site for the underground laboratory.  
Trucks involved in construction at the site would have had to 
drive through a wildlife corridor and therefore a number of 
conservationists had objected to the project.

*** Muon collider for Fermilab gains momentum
</H1> <P>
A muon collider might be harder to build than an e linear collider, but
one advantage is that it could be built in stages with physics 
opportunities at each stage.  One such step is Project X, another
is a neutrino factory.  Fermilab has submitted a DOE proposal to 
form a national muon-accelerator project, starting at $15m/year.  
Nature describes some of the motivation and challenges that this 
entails:

*** Reactor neutrino experiments and Baseball
</H1> <P>
New reactor neutrino experiments have three volumes of liquid,
including the middle "gamma catcher" which has scintillator but
no Gadolinium, to catch the electromagnetic energy from photons and
positron showers in the target.  On Double Chooz, some engineers prefer
French.  But put "gamma-catcher wall" into Babel Fish, and one gets
"mur gamma de gant de baseball".

*** Neutrino Crossword Puzzle
</H1> <P>
This crossword puzzle is probably unique in that all of the answers
are neutrino experiments.  But the clues themselves won't make you
think about neutrinos, only the answers.  It has been solved!

Of course it is not considered cheating to visit the web site of
the neutrino oscillation industry to be reminded of the diversity 
of the neutrino world.

*** Not all "Notable new references" get into PRL
</H1> <P>
A paper recently rejected by Physical Review Letters argued in 
their appeal that the it should be published because it
was mentioned as a "Notable New Reference".  It didn't help, nor
should it.  I try to include, room permitting, as many papers as I 
can find that might be interesting to readers, which I hope 
includes both some of the best and some of the worst ones.
