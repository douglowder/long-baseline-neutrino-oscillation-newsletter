<P>

*** South Korea's RENO reactor neutrino experiment filled
</H1> <P>
As of 5 July 2011, both the near and far detectors of RENO were 
filled with all liquids including the Gd loaded liquid scintillator 
target.  Dry runs had checked the PMTs and DAQ during March to May.  
Commissioning shifts & calibration efforts are currently underway, 
and physics data is expected to begin in August 2011.

<H1>
*** RENO to be inaugurated at LOWnu11, 9-12 Nov in Seoul
</H1> <P>
The 6th International Workshop on Low Energy Neutrino Physics will 
take place 9-12 November in South Korea, co-hosted by the Korea 
Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS) & the Korea Neutrino Research 
Center (KNRC). workshop.kias.re.kr/lownu11/

<H1>
*** NRC report on long-baseline next step for LBNE
</H1> <P>
Proceeding with three physics experiments, including LBNE, planned 
for DUSEL would provide an "exceptional opportunity" for major 
scientific advances & give the U.S. a leading role in underground 
science, says a new port by the National Research Council.  They 
wrote, "The long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment would 
provide a great advance in the study of neutrino properties, 
particularly when coupled with a neutrino beam produced at FNAL 
using a new high-intensity proton source under development."  The 
DOE's director of the Office of Science William Brinkman is 
expected to react to the Marx panel report on costs and the NRC 
report on physics and make a decision about DOE involvement at 
Homestake soon.

*** Underground Physics session at DPF in Providence
</H1> <P>
The APS Division of Particles and Fields is meeting 9-13 Aug at 
Brown (Providence, RI).  There is a special session: "Opportunities 
for U.S. Leadership in Underground-based Physics" on Thurs, 11 Aug
12:30-2pm.  Speakers - Brinkman, Kotcher (NSF) & Shochet (HEPAP)

*** New NuMI working group
</H1> <P>
There are several experiments using the NuMI beam line at FNAL:  
MINOS, MINERvA & NOvA; along with previously ArgoNeuT & future 
MINOS+.  A joint beam group is being formed to share both 
technical and intellectual knowledge about the beam flux and 
spectra, including geometry, modeling, stability and cross 
sections.  If interested, contact Alfons Weber

*** More antineutrino results from MiniBooNE
</H1> <P>
MiniBooNE, which previously showed antineutrino results from 5.66e20
protons on target, have shown results from 8.58e20 pot.  The
LSND-like excess persists, but is reduced; for E>475 MeV, oscillations
are favored over background-only at 91.1% CL.  However, a greater
excess is now seen at low energy, looking like the low energy
excess seen by MiniBooNE using neutrinos.  For E<475 MeV, the excess
is 38.6 +- 18.5 events.  They will continue running with a request
of 15e20 pot.

<H1>
*** More antineutrino running, results for MINOS
</H1> <P>
After the replacement of the NuMI target with a previous very hot
target (NT02), MINOS has resumed low energy high-intensity antineutrino 
running on 29 July, known as Run IX.  Previous results on
antineutrino oscillation parameters were shown for 1.71e20 pot.  Results from an 
additional 1.24 pot are expected to be shown at Lepton-Photon Mumbai.

<H1>
*** OPERA Status;  The expected rate is now with oscillations.
</H1> <P>
Opera has run long enough to see 1.65 expected tau.  Previously
experiments mentioned the expectation in the absence of oscillations.
Now we quote the "expectation" in the presence of oscillations.
They see one tau candidate, with 5.3e19 pot analyzed out of
12.6e19 collected and 22.5e19 expected by the end of 2012 or so.  
They got extra beam since there were problems at CERN in the Compass 
beam line.  They are continuously improving scanning performance & 
predicted background.  In particular, the background for the tau 
decay to muon is very low.  See

*** Long-Baseline neutrino experiments at short baselines
</H1> <P>
LBNE plans a 1300 km baseline, and other long-baseline proposals vary
from hundreds to thousands of km.  At NuFACT11, an argument was made
for a 200 km experiment, calling it a "short-baseline experiment".

<H1>
*** The small neutrino mixing angle is large
</H1> <P>
Last month, T2K and MINOS reported evidence for non-zero theta-13.
T2K's paper was mentioned last month, and MINOS now has a paper on
the subject:  Adamson et al., "Improved search for muon-neutrino
to electron-neutrino oscillations in MINOS", 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.0015"> arXiv:1108.0015 </A>.
In the tri-bimaximal mixing matrix, theta-13 is zero, but the new
best fit is in the upper half of the CHOOZ allowed region.  Many
theory papers now use "large" to describe this value, e.g.: 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0696"> arXiv:1107.0696 </A>,

*** Questions at NuFACT11 in Geneva Switzerland
</H1><p>
A panel was asked to address certain questions about neutrino 
physics and facilities.  In turn, the panel asked the conference 
a set of questions.  Answers are welcomed.
