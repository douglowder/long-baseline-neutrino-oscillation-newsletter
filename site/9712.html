<p> </p><h1>
***  New CERN director rumored to like long-baseline
</h1>The new CERN director Maiani will have a large say about the
next steps for the CERN to Gran Sasso long-baseline program.

<p> </p><h1>
***  Are neutrino oscillation limits statistically fallacious?
</h1>Experimenters often choose a 2-sided interval for a signal or a
1-sided interval for a limit depending on the data.  Cousins and
Feldman's new paper (below) shows this gives improper confidence
intervals.  But they develop a new method which solves this
problem and avoids unphysical confidence intervals as well.

<p> </p><h1>
***  New Karmen limits on LSND effect
</h1>Having rebuilt their shield to lower background, Karmen ran in
1997 from Feb to Sept with 1400 C, 1/6 of their goal.  The
detector and the new veto shield are working well.  The shield
efficiency on muons is 99.6%.  Looking for positrons from 15
to 50 MeV, they find zero with a cosmic background of 0.26.
They set a limit on oscillation probability &lt; 0.31% at 90% CL,
comparable to the putative LSND signal.

<p> </p><h1>
***  SNO finishes acrylic vessel
</h1>The vessel for the heavy water at Sudbury is now complete,  (see
Physics Today 12/97 cover).  PMT installation is going well with
about 3000 PMT's to go.  They will start filling the vessel in
February, staging the filling of the outer (light water) and inner
(heavy water) containers to minimize stress.  The  measurement of
the neutral current interaction rate in SNO is widely anticipated.
They expect 2200 NC/yr events based on the measured nu rate, if
the flux of mu neutrinos and tau neutrinos is zero (i.e. low solar
nu flux with no oscillations).  They expect 6000 NC/yr based on
the BP95 flux predictions.  NC efficiency will be about 1/4.

<p> </p><h1>
***  Better Calibration on Solar Data from Super-K;
</h1>SuperKamiokande now understands the energy calibration at low
electron energies at the 1% level.  They have calibrated using a
linac, (which so far only gives e's in one direction), a movable
Ni-Cf source, and N16 decay.  The linac data, which is
reproducible to 1%, was 2.6% shifted from the Ni-Cf source, which
required a large background subtraction and had poorer signal to
noise.   The N16, from muons hitting O16, agrees with the linac.

<p> </p><h1>
***  More Atmospheric Data from Super-K;
</h1>With 414 days data, or 25.5 kT-year, they get R= .612 +- .028
+- .049 (Honda flux) for sub-GeV and .665 +- .058 +- .081 for
Multi-GeV.  With Bartol fluxes the numbers are .611 &amp; .673.
The angular distributions still show a strong hint of a signal,
but sub-GeV data is flatter than the 300 day plot (which makes
more sense since it is hard to get a big effect in the sub-GeV
data.)

<p> </p><h1>
***  New SAGE data;  attempted Gallium theft
</h1>SAGE III data, which runs through March 1997, gives 65 SNU,
giving an average of 70.3 SNU for SAGE I-III.  With the K and L
peak combined, they get 69.9 +-8 +-4.  Plotted in 2 month bins,
the data is flat, but there is a small hint for the (expected)
seasonal variation (due to earth/sun distance change).  During
the last run of Gallex, which measured a flux which seems high
to some, SAGE measured slightly below their average flux.  But
as described in the November 14th issue of Science, an armed
attempted theft of SAGE's Gallium was thwarted by a locked door.
Six masked men, with two machine guns, took a fork lift driver
hostage and pried open the containers which had brought the
Gallium to Baksan.   But the Gallium had been installed and the
thieves left without it.   The high value of the Gallium is the
suspected cause of the attempt, but Long-Baseline News cannot rule
out the possibility that Saddam Hussein heard that neutrinos
caused the extinction of dinosaurs, and wanted to add a neutrino
detector to his arsenal of weapons of mass destruction.

<p> </p><h1>
***  ICARUS schedule
</h1>The frame for the first 600 ton module, which is being
constructed in Pavia, is almost complete.  The assembly including
the wire system, will be complete in July 1998.  The module will
be cooled and tested in Pavia before being taken to Gran Sasso.

<p> </p><h1>
***  New low MACRO results include upward contained vertex events
</h1>MACRO sees 350 +- 19 +-28 upward muons and expect 472 +-80
(Bartol flux).  The angular distributions remains enigmatic, with
a 1% probability of coming from no-oscillations, but only 5% from
the best fit oscillation point.   They now also report on their
upward contained vertex events (which they expect to be 90%
quasielastic numu CC induced).  They expect 102+-20.  Their data
is 61+-8 with a background of about 6.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Japanese Hadron Facility Workshop
</h1>This workshop, which will include neutrino capabilities of the 50
GeV machine, is March 4-7th at KEK. Link to "neutrino meetings"
