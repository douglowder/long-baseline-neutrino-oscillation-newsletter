</p><h1>Brookhaven Long Baseline Experiment Approved</h1>
In a gutsy move, Mel Schwartz approved P889 to
send a neutrino beam to 3 water detectors, the
far one 20 km from BNL in Long Island.   However,
given the funding situation at Brookhaven, it is
not clear what being approved means.  Since their
earlier approval, P889 has added a numbe of
collaborators from Los Alamos, Triumf, and elsewhere.

<h1>Bad scenario for LSND possible.  </h1>
Clarence Richardson from DOE at the Hadron Beams
workshop at BNL said that Lampf may have to shut off
in October.   LSND is almost ready to take data, and
it is crazy to build it and then run for one month
rather than its two years.  Some improvement in
numu to nutau would be possible, but more at low
mixing than low mass.  The Los Alamos funding situation
is confused because last year thier money was put in
the military side of the DOE, and this year that money
seems to be gone.   Maybe the DOE can find it?

<h1>BNL workshop compares long baseline experiments.</h1>
The workshop on hadron beams was a good opportunity to
compare possible efforts including Fermilab 822,
Fermilab 803, Fermilab 860, BNL 889, LSND, Kaon K1,
LSND, and KeK to Superkamiokande.  No-one pushing
CERN or SSC was there.

<h1>P822 meeting on April 21st is coming up.</h1>
Please
mark your calendars and tell me if you are or aren't
able to come!!  I will be bugging you again soon with
agendae.

<h1>URA presentation at Fermilab</h1>
Gina Rameika presented NUMI, and Rocky Kolb described a
possible future Fermilab initiative underground.

<h1>SSC workshop</h1>
A meeting to discuss neutrinos at the SSC was held
in february 6.  A neutrino workshop will apparently be
scheduled in September.  There will be a working group
meeting before the atmospheric workshop in Baton Rouge
which is May 6-8.  The working meeting will be in Baton
Rouge May 4-6.  For information, contact
sscvx1::jthomas.

<h1>Report From Moriond</h1>
Moriond held a week's meeting on neutrinos.  Stephen
Parke reports nothing new.

<h1>SSC/CERN</h1>
#The SSC held a planning session on Feb. 6th for a
possible neutrino workshop, but no date has been
announced.  At a presentation to the URA, Schwitters said
about using SSC's 200 GeV injector that there were some
really nice ideas (long and short baseline) that would
allow SSC to do some real physics before the main accelerator
turns on, but because of the budget and political
situation, he would absolutely not consider anything that
detracts from the main construction program.
#CERN has touched base with some of the NUMI people, and
ICARUS, in particular, has been mentioned by several
people for a possible long baseline experiment.
However, another CERN scientist described thier long
baseline plans as "unfathomable".
