*** Borexino sees the CERN beam.
</H1>
If you put a neutrino detector into a neutrino beam, it sees
neutrinos.  Last year Borexino filled with about 300 t of water
in their detector with 2240 photomultiplier tubes looking in.
During two brief periods of CNGS running, they obtained 5 events 
when 5 were expected, and twelve events when 10 were expected.  
During normal operation, they expect 315 events/day total and 
47 CC+NC events with a vertex in the detector.  Every neutrino
that passes through OPERA will pass through Borexino first.
In December the first 11 m^3 of scintillator were added to the
inner vessel.  They are now simultaneously draining the water 
and adding the scintillator, and they plan to complete in May.

*** MiniBooNE and boxing
</H1>
Results of a short-baseline neutrino oscillation search from the 
MiniBooNE experiment at Fermilab are scheduled to be discussed at 
a seminar at Fermilab on April 11.  MiniBooNE is sensitive to numu 
to nue oscillations at the same value of L/E as a reported signal 
from the LSND experiment at Los Alamos.  I expect them to show the
presence or absence of an excess of low energy electrons (below 2 
GeV).  The "blind" analysis has been done with a large amount of 
neutrino running.  MiniBooNE is currently running with 
anti-neutrinos, and they got to do systematic checks with two
unexpected antineutrino beam configurations for a few months. Ten 
metal plate were designed to provide an opportunity to shorten the 
length of the decay pipe and two of them fell down, inadvertently 
partially blocking part of that pipe.  Repairs will be done 4/11.

*** Unified Reactor Neutrino Calculations and the Final Four
</H1>
Since the International Working Group on Reactor Neutrinos
starting considering a new experiment to measure theta_13,
many reactor sites have been considered.  There are now four
experiments moving ahead:  Angra in Brazil, Daya Bay in China, 
Double Chooz in France and RENO in South Korea.  A detailed 
quantitative discussion of the theta-13 reach of these four
experiments is presented by Mention et al. in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:0704.0498">
arXiv:0704.0498 
</A>
(Beware the new ArXiv numbering scheme.)  Sensitivities depend
on assumed systematic errors, backgrounds, run times, and reactor
power assumptions, in addition to detector layout as proposed.
90% CL limits are calculated (sin^2 2 theta-13) for Double Chooz 
(0.0278), Daya Bay Mid with LAII off (0.0410), Daya Bay Mid with
LAII on (0.038), Daya Bay Far (0.011) and RENO (0.0213).  
Completion dates are not specified.

*** Brazilians fund ANGRA antineutrino effort and soccer
</H1>
Initial funding includes mention of the non-proliferation
aspects of antineutrino detection.

*** Feedback, neutrinos and Cricket
</H1>
This month I heard the following report on National Public Radio.
"A South African Player set a new world record in the Cricket World
Cup by getting six sixes in an over.  If you care, you understand."
Long-Baseline News has lots of neutrino jargon and details, but
it also has many subscribers who are not physicists.  There are a 
variety of reasons for wanting to keep track of the neutrino world.
If you don't understand something, and want to, please feel free to
ask me.  More often, feedback is probably appropriate when I leave
something out or get something wrong.  And while I may not care, I
am curious to try to learn what six-sixes in an over are.

*** Neutrino Factory Golden Channel Meeting and Sailing
</H1>
The First International Workshop on the Golden Channel at a Neutrino
Factory will be held in Valencia Spain 27-30 June 2007.

America's Cup Sailing is 23 
Jun-7 July, so early accommodation and flight booking is essential.

*** Summer School on Neutrinos at Fermilab and Baseball
</H1>
Fermilab and KEK are running a Summer School on neutrino physics, 
aimed at advanced graduate students and recent post docs.  It will be
July 2 - 13, 2007 at Fermilab.  Enrollment is limited and the 
registration deadline is May 11, 2007.   
<A href="http://nuss.fnal.gov/">
See http://nuss.fnal.gov/  </A>
Cubs tickets are also limited, but baseball fans who haven't been to 
Wrigley Field can try for the 13-July game.

There are 7 
possibilities then to see the Kane County Cougars.

*** Models, Super-models and the neutrino mass from cosmology
</H1>
Maybe theorists should take a page from the Sports Illustrated
Swimsuit issue and call their best models - super-models.  The
WMAP data can be analyzed with different models and the neutrino
mass or limits obtained vary.  This model dependence was called 
a systematic error at WIN07, but I don't think that's right.
Hannestand & Wong have looked at realistic assumptions about neutrino
mass sensitivity from future high redshift galaxy surveys, and get
0.05 eV at 95% CL for a minimal 8-parameter cosmological model.
In a more general model framework, 3 times worse.
