*** CERN rejects I-216
</h1>The proposal to study low mixing numu to nue at CERN was rejected
by CERN last month.  Even though the experiment would have been a
Major Advance for the Investigation of Active Neutrino
Interactions (MAIANI), CERN has apparently decided to concentrate
on the two NGS experiments, ICANOE and OPERA.   One physicist
called the LSND effect "An American Problem".

*** Joint LSND/Karmen analysis
</h1>Klaus Eitel has written a paper that describes a joint analysis
of the LSND and KARMEN data.  LSND has evidence for oscillations
that is not confirmed by KARMEN.  However, there is a region in
the sin^2(2q),Dm^2 space where the results of both experiments
are statistically compatible. This joint analysis is based on
likelihood functions for both data sets.

*** K2K long-baseline Status
</h1>K2K ended its run in June with 5.3 10^18 protons on target.  they
got about 4 10^12 p per pulse, ~2/3 design value.  They had 4
events total, 1 in fidvol, in coincidence with 1 microsec(us) beam
spill, and no background in +- 50 us.  Beam resumes in November.

*** Solar Neutrinos and hep flux
</h1>The hep high energy solar neutrino flux is predicted in solar
models with large theoretical uncertainty.  The extra high energy
solar events in Super-K are fit with and without this overall
flux as a free parameter.   A solar neutrino oscillation fit with
standard hep values is best fit in the vacuum oscillation region,
sin^2-2q = 0.79, dm^2=4.3 10^-10, chi^2-min=44.1/35 dof.  If the
hep flux is put in as a free parameter, the best fit moves to the
large region, sin^2-2q=0.80, dm^2=3.2 10^-5 or the low region,
sin^2-2q=1.0, dm^2=2.4 10^-7.  The fit gives 16 times the
standard model hep flux, but a hep-only fit, concentrating on
18-25 MeV limits the hep flux to &lt; 15 times the standard model.

*** MONOLITH
</h1>
<a href="http://www.desy.de/~hoepfner/Neutrino/Monolith/">
MONOLITH </a> is a 34 kton magnetized calorimeter project devoted to
atmospheric neutrino and cosmic ray physics. Its primary physics
goal is a precise measurement of the Dm2 solution suggested by
Super-Kamiokande atmo nu results, via the first minimum of the
L/E distribution of nu-mu events.  MONOLITH wasn't discussed by
the committees held on 9/13 (Gran Sasso) and 14 (CERN), who
examined only LBL beam experiments.  Atmospheric nu projects
will be discussed by the LNGS Scientific Committee on 11/22.

*** U_MNS, the weak mixing matrix
</h1>The matrix that relates the neutrino mass and weak eigenstates is
increasingly being called U_MNS, for Maki, Nakagawa and Sakata
who wrote an article using the 2x2 matrix in 1962 (before
Cabbibo.)   Sakata distinguished between numu and nue in 1943 (!)
in an article published in 1946.  Others call this the weak CKM
matrix.  It is interesting to note that Maki, Nakagawa, Sakata,
Koboyoshi and Maskawa are all from Nagoya University.

*** Site non-specific neutrino factories
</h1>The Neutrino Factory/Mu Collider Collaboration received a
verbal solicitation from the NSF for a Letter of Intent for R&amp;D
towards a (non-site-specific) design study for a neutrino factory.
The Letter should include:  1.  The physics case for a nu
factory, 2. A technical sketch of the factory,  3.  A proposal
for R&amp;D funds not less than $25M over a 3-year period, beginning
in 2002, as part of the NSF Major Research Equipment program.
The Letter is due 11/1/99 for review 11/29.
Progress is viewable at

*** A site-specific neutrino factory at Fermilab
</h1>The NSF initiative is formally separate from a site-specific FNAL
effort due Mar. 31, 2000.  However, the physics goal is the same;
many interested parties are the same. Fermilab will study a mu
storage ring neutrino source (neutrino factory), including 1. The
motivation for a nu source based on a mu storage ring, operating
after the current set of neutrino oscillation experiments and 2.
The program as a function of: a) E(mu) [maximum 50 GeV], b) The
number of muon decays per year (10^19 - 10^21) c) polarization and
d) experiment baseline distance.   See

*** Neutrino factory at Rutherford Appleton Lab
</h1>Challenges of a neutrino factory at RAL overlap with similar needs
for the (N)ESS, such as the high intensity p source.  There is
work at RAL on scattering in LH_2 (relevant to ionisation cooling)
and on targets capable of withstanding the 4MW (20MW? - probably
not) of power in the beam.  Various 'targets' for the nu's have
been mooted: LNGS, Boulby, SuperK and Soudan/Minos.  There will be
a UK 1-day meeting on (probably)  7th Dec., probably in Birmingham
with a title like 'Future neutrino Physics'.  A Statement of
Interest in a Neutrino Factory has just been submitted to the UK
PPESP for its meeting 4th October with about 20 names on it.

*** CERN neutrino factory
</h1>A presentation about nu factories was made to the CERN Scientific
policy committee on 21st Sept and was very favourably received.
