*** Our first value for the CP violating phase delta 
</H1> <P>
A full 3-flavor Super-K analysis presented at Neutrino 2010 had a 
normal hierarchy delta between 140.8 and 297.3 degrees at 68%CL, 
with a best fit near 220.  It was pointed out to me that Chen & 
Mahanthappa, in two Phys. Lett. papers predicted 227 degrees, and 
9 parameters predicting well 22 quantities.  See

*** NOvA passes DOE review
</H1> <P>
NOvA is spending money, so it gets an annual DOE progress review,
until it is done (CD-4).  CD-4 deliverables will be to upgrade
the Fermilab proton source from 320kW to 700kW, build a new Far 
Detector Hall and a 14 kiloton Far Detector, build a 222 t Near 
Detector underground after an Integration Prototype Near Detector 
takes data on the surface.  The committee provided the usual 
findings and comments, but overall things are going well.

<H1>
*** LHC trouble --> Tevatron extension? --> NOvA delays?
</H1> <P>
The Fermilab Program advisory committee met 27 Aug to consider a 
3 year Tevatron extension for 7pb^(-1) (beyond Sep 2011).  
<A href="http://www.fnal.gov/directorate/program_planning/Aug2010PACPublic/Aug2010PACReport.pdf"> 
http://www.fnal.gov/directorate/program_planning/Aug2010PACPublic/Aug2010PACReport.pdf
</A>
They advised yes, whether there was additional funding or not.
This opportunity didn't seem to exist a few years ago looking at
LHC schedules of the time.  But opportunities have costs.  With
extended Tevatron, NOvA construction remains on schedule, but
the NuMI beam power will be limited to 400 kW during Collider
operations.  The ramp up to 700 kW would be delayed until the 
Recyler Ring recommissioning is accomplished.  Gary Feldman 
showed the PAC the NOvA impacts, which include delaying the first
results by 2 years; final results by 1.5 yr, & add 3.7M$ to cost.

*** Unlikely role for solar neutrinos
</H1> <P>

They find evidence for solar periodicity rates in nuclear decay data.
Do solar neutrinos affect radioactivity rates on earth?  It doesn't
sound right.  That makes it intriguing.

*** T2K Progress and Status
</H1> <P>
T2K accumulated 3.35e+19 POT through 26 June, and 22 neutrino 
events were observed by Super-Kamiokande through mid May.  There 
is a shutdown and maintenance period for the neutrino beam 
facility and the near detector ND280 until the end of October, and 
beam operation with higher power (>100kW) is planned from 
November. Maintenance will be carried out to achieve a more stable
operation of the beam.  The barrel ECALs, which are the remaining 
ND280 sub-detectors, are being installed.

<H1>
*** Subtle is the Lord, and the Neutrino
</H1> <P>
Akhmedov and Smirnov consider several subtle aspects of the theory
of neutrino oscillations which have been under discussion
recently.

*** Light at the End of the Tunnel
</H1> <P>
Near the beginning of the new movie 
"The American", George Clooney 
is driving through a long tunnel in Italy, and exits in Gran Sasso 
National Park.  Did he stop and visit the neutrino experiments; 
Opera, Icarus, LVD and Borexino?  The movie doesn't tell us.  It 
also doesn't tell us why people are shooting at each other.

<H1>
*** Lorentz Violation
</H1> <P>
I'm hoping that the phenomenon of Lorentz violation doesn't exist,
so that we don't have to explain the phrase to non-scientists.
But a workshop on this subject elicited many ideas that might be
of interest to neutrino physicists.  There is "A quantum field
model for tachyonic neutrinos with Lorentz symmetry breaking"
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.5418"> arXiv:1007.5418, </A>

and "A New Lorentz-Violating Model of Neutrino
Oscillations",

to name a few.

*** Neu2012 meeting at CERN 27-28 September
</H1> <P>
This workshop is on future accelerator nu physics in Europe: 
emphasis on CERN.  It includes sessions on CNGS beam possibilities 
after the approved program, low energy beam at the PS, test beam 
for detector R&D, other R&D opportunities toward future neutrino 
facilities.

*** WIN2011 and Engelbracht School Jan 11 in South Africa
</H1> <P>
The next Weak Interactions and Neutrino (WIN) meeting is
31 Jan-5 Feb 11 in Cape Town South Africa.  It will be preceded by
a Summer School in nearby Stellenbosch, 20-29 Jan 11.
