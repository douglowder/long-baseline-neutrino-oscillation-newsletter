*** NOE information available on web
</h1>Proposal documents and other information about the proposed
NOE long-baseline experiment from CERN to Gran Sasso are
available -- http:://www.na.infn.it/SubNucl/accel/noe/noe.html

*** Caveat
</h1>Long-baseline news is a rumor sheet.  Statements and facts
presented here should not be quoted but are made available so
that interested persons can follow up those rumors they might be
interested in.  I don't make anything up, (even on April fool's
day) but I often misunderstand things, as we all do.  Normal
journalistic standards require two sources for a story.  But that
doesn't match the needs of a rumor sheet, so one is sufficient.

*** CERN neutrino beam test approved;  "SPY"
</h1>The greatest uncertainty in calculating neutrino fluxes comes
from the uncertainty in low energy Secondary Particle Yields from
a nuclear target.  The "SPY" collaboration has proposed and been
approved for a two week CERN run with the NA52 experiment to measure
the production rate of pi's and K's below 60 GeV/c from 450 GeV/c
protons hitting a Be target.   They will have 12 days of beam
starting 17 April, after one week of parasitic setup.

*** Solar Neutrino Workshop in April
</h1>There will be a Workshop on Solar Neutrino Experiments at
Fermilab; April 26-27, 1996.  The scientific staff at Fermilab is
very interested in the developments that are occurring in the field
of Solar Neutrinos.  Some members of the Laboratory would like to
investigate the possibility of a mutually beneficial arrangement
between external experimental groups and a small group of scientists
within the Laboratory, comparable to the participation of a university
group in a typical Fermilab experiment. One potential for cooperation
between Fermilab and the solar neutrino community might revolve around
the Soudan Mine, where Fermilab will mount the MINOS long-baseline
experiment.  The workshop is aimed at those familiar with the basic
issues in solar neutrinos and will focus on options for both near-term
and long-term future experiments.  Information regarding the workshop
can be found at:   http://fnas08.fnal.gov/
Questions may be addressed to .

*** Neutrino telescopes see the light
</h1>At the Venice nu telescope meeting, the Lake Baikal group reported
their first neutrino event, an upgoing muon of energy greater
than 8 GeV. There were progress reports from CHORUS and NOMAD.
Sciama's theory of a decaying tau neutrino of mass 28.2 eV, which
predicts a line in the ultraviolet at 14.1 eV will get a crucial
test in the next few months, when a search for such a line in the
neighborhood of the sun will be made.  Vanucci looked at the sun
during an eclipse and presented limits on neutrino lifetimes.

<p> </p><h1>
*** MINOS test beam starts at SLAC
</h1>Physicists from DUBNA, CALtech, ANL Livermore Tufts and elsewhere
are starting to use 1-6 GeV electrons from the SLAC test beam to study
shower response for calorimetry in proposed detectors for MINOS.
First to be studied are resistive plate chambers from Caltech and
Limited Stream tubes from ANL.  There is one run starting in
late March and another in May.

*** Neutrino Oscillation Industry Web Page
</h1>An attempt to create a page with links to all neutrino
oscillation experiments has been attempted, and is available at
http://www.hep.anl.gov/NDK/Hypertext/nuindustry.html
Links, updates, suggestions on content, and ideas for a logos are
welcome.

*** New Scientist;  Physics Today
</h1>Long-Baseline Nus and related topics were subjects of articles in
Mar 16 issue of New Scientist and Feb issue of Physics Today.

*** Soudan 2 thesis on atmospheric neutrinos
</h1>A 1.5 Kt-year analysis of Soudan 2 data, including new .5 Kt-year
data, is described in Hugh Gallagher's thesis (University of
Minnesota, March 1996).  The flavor ratio of ratios, based on one of two
analysis groups, is .75 +- .16 stat +- .14 syst.  The systematic
error is dominated by an estimate of differences between two
analysis groups (+- .10), one of which wasn't complete.  It may
be a considerable overestimate.  When printed, copies may be
requested from
