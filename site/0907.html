*** Future Neutrinos in Japan; J-PARC inaugurated July 6
</H1> <P>
To celebrate the new beams at the site of the next long-baseline 
neutrino experiment, there was an inauguration 6 Jul. There were 
~900 people participating; > 60 from abroad.  Two ministers, many 
Diet members, past JAEA presidents, past Directors & Presidents of 
INS/Tokyo, the local Governor, Mayor, President of Science Council 
of Japan, 2 Nobel Laureates (Kobayashi & Koshiba).  The Director 
General at CERN and the Undersecretary of DOE joined by video.

This is being organized at CERN by the Neutrino Panel of the CERN 
Scientific Policy Committee and by CERN management.  A clear 
picture will emerge of 1) the compelling physics case; 2) the R&D 
and design study efforts world-wide and 3) critical areas where 
more coherent effort is needed.  The SPC Panel will produce a 
report for the Dec. CERN Council, to be followed by statements 
from the CERN Council Strategy Secretariat and CERN management on 
the role that CERN should play in a global accelerator nu program.

*** EPS Prize for Gargamelle Awarded for neutrino neutral currents
</H1> <P>
This year's EPS-High Energy and Particle Physics Prize was awarded 
to the Gargamelle Collaboration for the discovery of the weak 
neutral current(NC). This was key for our standard model. On 3 Sep 
1973 the 59 scientists published 2 papers in the same issue of Phys. 
Lett.: 1) NC involving electrons, 2) NC interactions with hadrons 
(p&n).  The race with other experiments became known to some
as "alternating neutral currents".

*** Will the Nobel Prize be awarded for neutrino oscillations?
</H1> <P>
The award to Davis and Koshiba came close, but clearly left room 
for another prize.  Some who have passed away are ineligible.  
If anyone asked me, I would give the award to:  T. Kajita 
(Kamiokande/Super-K); A. Suzuki (KamLAND); A. McDonald (SNO).

*** Neutrino Giant Prize from Long-Baseline News for Pontecorvo
</H1> <P>
A "neutrino giant" is not an oxymoron (jumbo shrimp).  Henceforth
Long-Baseline News will annually add a name to a list appearing 
on the www.neutrinooscillation.org site for "Neutrino Giants", 
important contributors to the burgeoning neutrino physics field.  
In 1948 Bruno Pontecorvo proposed a radiochemical method for
neutrino detection. He discussed advantages of the Cl-Ar reaction.
(cheap liquid, ease to extract Ar etc).  He pointed out possible 
nu sources (reactors, the sun, radioactive materials prepared 
in a reactor).  In 1947 he discovered that the constant of muon
capture is the same as the Fermi constant and he was the first who 
put forward the idea of muon/electron universal weak interactions.
In 57-58 he proposed an idea for neutrino oscillations.  At that 
time only one type of neutrino was known. He considered antinu --> 
nu (sterile) oscillations. Thus, he invented not only oscillations 
but also sterile neutrinos. He considered a possible experiment 
with reactor antineutrinos (like KamLAND).  He pointed out that 
experiments with nus from accelerators are possible in 1959.   As 
a 1st problem, he proposed to look at whether the electron and 
muon neutrinos were the same or different.  In 1967 he pointed out 
that (due to oscillations) the observed flux of solar neutrinos 
can be half the prediction, thus foreseeing the solar nu problem.

*** More Neutrino Prizes-Saoulidou; Ayres; Lipkin; Sanchez; Cowsik
</H1> <P>
The European Physical Society awarded N. Saoulidou (DONUT/MINOS)  
its 2009 Young Physicist Prize for outstanding neutrino research.

description of oscillations, was awarded the 2009 EMET prize in 
Exact Sciences in Israel

Raman Cowsik, who early calculated astrophysical neutrino fluxes,
and invented hot dark matter, as well as the leaky box model, won 
the 2009 O'Ceallaigh medal at the Cosmic Ray Conference.

*** Uncaffeinated neutrino physicists
</H1> <P>
Some jet-lagged physicists need coffee to pay attention.  But the 
ICRC charged 440 Euro registration fee (no meals) and had no
coffee at coffee breaks.  In the many-worlds theory of 
quantum mechanics are universes where instant coffee counts
as coffee, but we broke off from those world lines long ago.

<H1>
*** More Atmospheric Neutrinos in Super-K
</H1> <P>
Super-K has data from 518 days of SK-III.  No surprise, the 
atmospheric neutrinos oscillate.  The best fit for the L/E 
analysis is mixing 1.0 and dmsq 2.2 e-3 eV^2, or 1.9 to 2.6 
at 90%CL.  The best fit for nutau appearance is now 138 +- 48 
(stat) +14.8-31.6(sys) which is 2.4 sigma and consistent with 
expectation 78.4+-26.  A quadrant analysis including the solar 
term (for theta-23) found sin^2(theta) to be from 0.410 to 0.585 
at 90%CL (i.e. no observed deviation from 0.500.)
