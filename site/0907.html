*** Future Neutrinos in Japan; J-PARC inaugurated July 6
</h1> <p>
To celebrate the new beams at the site of the next long-baseline
neutrino experiment, there was an inauguration 6 Jul. There were
~900 people participating; &gt; 60 from abroad.  Two ministers, many
Diet members, past JAEA presidents, past Directors &amp; Presidents of
INS/Tokyo, the local Governor, Mayor, President of Science Council
of Japan, 2 Nobel Laureates (Kobayashi &amp; Koshiba).  The Director
General at CERN and the Undersecretary of DOE joined by video.

This is being organized at CERN by the Neutrino Panel of the CERN
Scientific Policy Committee and by CERN management.  A clear
picture will emerge of 1) the compelling physics case; 2) the R&amp;D
and design study efforts world-wide and 3) critical areas where
more coherent effort is needed.  The SPC Panel will produce a
report for the Dec. CERN Council, to be followed by statements
from the CERN Council Strategy Secretariat and CERN management on
the role that CERN should play in a global accelerator nu program.

*** EPS Prize for Gargamelle Awarded for neutrino neutral currents
</h1> <p>
This year's EPS-High Energy and Particle Physics Prize was awarded
to the Gargamelle Collaboration for the discovery of the weak
neutral current(NC). This was key for our standard model. On 3 Sep
1973 the 59 scientists published 2 papers in the same issue of Phys.
Lett.: 1) NC involving electrons, 2) NC interactions with hadrons
(p&amp;n).  The race with other experiments became known to some
as "alternating neutral currents".

*** Will the Nobel Prize be awarded for neutrino oscillations?
</h1> <p>
The award to Davis and Koshiba came close, but clearly left room
for another prize.  Some who have passed away are ineligible.
If anyone asked me, I would give the award to:  T. Kajita
(Kamiokande/Super-K); A. Suzuki (KamLAND); A. McDonald (SNO).

*** Neutrino Giant Prize from Long-Baseline News for Pontecorvo
</h1> <p>
A "neutrino giant" is not an oxymoron (jumbo shrimp).  Henceforth
Long-Baseline News will annually add a name to a list appearing
on the www.neutrinooscillation.org site for "Neutrino Giants",
important contributors to the burgeoning neutrino physics field.
In 1948 Bruno Pontecorvo proposed a radiochemical method for
neutrino detection. He discussed advantages of the Cl-Ar reaction.
(cheap liquid, ease to extract Ar etc).  He pointed out possible
nu sources (reactors, the sun, radioactive materials prepared
in a reactor).  In 1947 he discovered that the constant of muon
capture is the same as the Fermi constant and he was the first who
put forward the idea of muon/electron universal weak interactions.
In 57-58 he proposed an idea for neutrino oscillations.  At that
time only one type of neutrino was known. He considered antinu --&gt;
nu (sterile) oscillations. Thus, he invented not only oscillations
but also sterile neutrinos. He considered a possible experiment
with reactor antineutrinos (like KamLAND).  He pointed out that
experiments with nus from accelerators are possible in 1959.   As
a 1st problem, he proposed to look at whether the electron and
muon neutrinos were the same or different.  In 1967 he pointed out
that (due to oscillations) the observed flux of solar neutrinos
can be half the prediction, thus foreseeing the solar nu problem.

*** More Neutrino Prizes-Saoulidou; Ayres; Lipkin; Sanchez; Cowsik
</h1> <p>
The European Physical Society awarded N. Saoulidou (DONUT/MINOS)
its 2009 Young Physicist Prize for outstanding neutrino research.

Harry
Lipkin, who still worries about the proper quantum mechanical
description of oscillations, was awarded the 2009 EMET prize in
Exact Sciences in Israel

Raman Cowsik, who early calculated astrophysical neutrino fluxes,
and invented hot dark matter, as well as the leaky box model, won
the 2009 O'Ceallaigh medal at the Cosmic Ray Conference.

*** Uncaffeinated neutrino physicists
</h1> <p>
Some jet-lagged physicists need coffee to pay attention.  But the
ICRC charged 440 Euro registration fee (no meals) and had no
coffee at coffee breaks.  In the many-worlds theory of
quantum mechanics are universes where instant coffee counts
as coffee, but we broke off from those world lines long ago.

</p><h1>
*** More Atmospheric Neutrinos in Super-K
</h1> <p>
Super-K has data from 518 days of SK-III.  No surprise, the
atmospheric neutrinos oscillate.  The best fit for the L/E
analysis is mixing 1.0 and dmsq 2.2 e-3 eV^2, or 1.9 to 2.6
at 90%CL.  The best fit for nutau appearance is now 138 +- 48
(stat) +14.8-31.6(sys) which is 2.4 sigma and consistent with
expectation 78.4+-26.  A quadrant analysis including the solar
term (for theta-23) found sin^2(theta) to be from 0.410 to 0.585
at 90%CL (i.e. no observed deviation from 0.500.)
