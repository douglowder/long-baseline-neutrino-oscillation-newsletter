*** MINOS+ sees neutrinos in the NuMI beam
</h1> <p>

</a>
The first long-baseline neutrino observed in MINOS+ was observed
4 September as the NuMI beam started up.  They are running with
2.5e13 POT/spill, 275 kW, and expect 2-3 e20 POT exposure in a year.

*** CERN approves neutrino work but not beam
</h1> <p>
In line with the approved European Strategy, an initial project is
starting at CERN, with the aim to provide an effective platform
for future neutrino research activities at and/or outside CERN.
The proposal SPSC-P-347 (ICARUS-NESSiE) and the expression of
interest SPSC-E-007 (LAGUNA) have been conditionally approved by
the August 2013 CERN Research Board with the CERN code WA104 and
WA105 respectively. Conditionally implies that at this moment in
time the construction of a short-baseline neutrino beam is not
granted and the focus is mainly on detector technology development
and qualification in test beams.

</p><h1>
*** CHIPS, its own little nowhere in the middle of nowhere
</h1> <p>
The idea is a water Cherenkov detector &gt;60 m deep in the Wentworth
Mine Pit, which is already in the NuMI beam.  They were encouraged
to formulate short term R&amp;D plans that could improve prospects for
future funding.  This week instruments to study water currents
will be deployed, using MINOS steel welded together as an anchor.
A 3-5 year R&amp;D proposal R&amp;D proposal will be submitted this month
to DOE/FNAL/STFC.  Its vision is to join up the NuMI and LBNE
programs to provide seamless access to highest intensity nu beam.

*** NuSTEC to improve neutrino generators
</h1> <p>
There is an effort to create a CTEQ-like collaboration including
both theorists and experimentalists to study neutrino-nucleus
scattering, called NuSTEC (Neutrino Scattering Theoretical
Experimental Collaboration). Its 3 goals:  1)  neutrino scattering
physics studies that could lead to improvements of Monte Carlo
generators, 2)  organization of workshops,  3)  a Neutrino
Scattering Physics School aimed at advanced doctoral students and
beginning postdocs.  A further goal could be the eventual writing
of a "Handbook of Neutrino-nucleus Scattering Physics" similar to
the Perturbative QCD Handbook CTEQ wrote in the 90's.  Contact

with ideas/interest.

*** How the Department of Energy copes with a shutdown
</h1> <p>
I told a friend in Europe that we didn't have a government.
He offered his.  Here is the US-DOE plan for the shutdown:

*** ICFA town meetings to discuss neutrinos
</h1> <p>
The ICFA Neutrino Panel was set up with the mandate to promote
international cooperation in development of the accelerator-based
neutrino-oscillation program and to promote international
collaboration in the development a neutrino factory as a future
intense source of neutrinos for particle physics experiments.
They are organizing a series of Town Meetings to consult with the
neutrino community: The Americas: 30 Jan - 1 Feb 2014 at Fermilab,
Asia: 13 Nov 2013 at the Kavli IPMU, Kashiwa, Japan during NNN13,
Europe: 8-10 Jan 2014 at the University of Paris Diderot.

*** RENO update
</h1> <p>
With a better estimate of the Li/He background, RENO updated their
reactor neutrino disappearance result at TAUP and WIN2013.  Using the same
403 day sample previously reported, sin^2(2q13) = 0.100 +- 0.010
(stat) as before, but the systematic error is reduced from
0.015 to 0.012.  With 700 days of data so far, they have a rate
plus shape analysis in progress.

*** 16 additions to the Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment
</h1> <p>
The city of Snowmass is in Colorado, but the study took place in
Minnesota.  LBNE had its collaboration meeting in Colorado and
added 5 groups from Brazil, 4 from UK, 7 from Italy.  It went from
&gt;90% US to 20% non-US of its 455 members from 79 institutions.
While rains which the U.S. weather service termed "biblical"
pounded Colorado, LBNE responded by shortening its coffee break.

*** Change newsletter name to Weakileaks?
</h1> <p>
Last month I reported on something that I heard at a conference,
which I'm told was true and funded but not approved.  There was
a suggestion to change the name of this newsletter to Weakileaks.

*** T2K remains off due to May accident at J-PARC

</a>
A report
from J-PARC describes the material radiation leak at the Hadron
facility.  Due to a malfunction of the slow beam extraction,
2 10^13 protons were delivered to a gold target in 5 ms which is
believed to have melted.  Radioactive material was dispersed, but
it was not realized/reported for about a day.  A variety of
improved safety measures are being implemented, and better
safety for users and local residents is promised.  No date is
set yet.
