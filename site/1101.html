*** LAGUNA now LAGUNA LBNO; for long-baseline
</h1> <p>
LAGUNA is the design of a pan-European Infrastructure for "Large
Apparatus studying Grand Unification, Neutrino Astronomy and Long-
Baseline Neutrino Oscillations."  In particular, they have studied
&amp; costed deep underground Science Facilities for a next generation
neutrino observatory in Europe.  7 technical site-dependent design
reports are available, and a joint report on potential European
sites will be available soon.  3 sites are the main options for
long-baseline: CN2FR (Frejus, 130 km from CERN), CN2PY (Pyhasalmi,
2288 km) and CNGS (Umbria, 658 km).  The site in Italy has the
advantage that the beam  exists, but the disadvantage that a near
detector is unlikely.  The next LAGUNA meeting is 3-4 Mar at CERN.

*** DUSEL &amp; LBNE
</h1> <p>
The 300 member LBNE collaboration is planning a new long-baseline
neutrino experiment from Fermilab to the Homestake mine.  At the
Jan 2011 LBNE meeting, it was affirmed that DOE HEP is continuing
to pursue LBNE even though the future of DUSEL is up in the air.
The mission need for LBNE was independent of whether the NSF was
constructing DUSEL.  The project is going forward and locating the
far detector at Homestake with or without DUSEL is possible.  The
DOE needs to know the cost of Water Cherenkov and Liquid Argon
options including infrastructure assuming DOE bears the full cost.

</p><h1>
*** DUSEL Preliminary Design Report
</h1> <p>
Although NSF funding for DUSEL is problematic for the rest of the
year, the DUSEL project office recently finished and froze the
Preliminary Design Report for the Laboratory.  There are ten
volumes of material including Cost, Science, Facility Design
and Operations Plans.  A comprehensive internal review is
scheduled for March 2011, based on $875M.  A DUSEL fact sheet
is available at

*** Deep Lab in the Andes?  Workshop 11-14 April in Argentina
</h1> <p>
The construction of the Agua Negra tunnel between Argentina and
Chile gives the scientific community a unique opportunity to build
an underground laboratory 1750m deep under the Earth surface in
the southern hemisphere. The plans for the ANDES underground lab
have to be finished before mid 2011 in order to be included in the
tunnel excavation. Its opening would be in 2018.  The First
International Workshop for the Design of the ANDES Underground
Laboratory will study how to plan the laboratory according to the
needs of the underground physics community.

*** Sign up (again) for DUSEL Research Association
</h1> <p>
Everyone in DuRA, the DUSEL user's organization, has asked all
members to reaffirm their membership, by filling out a survey at
<a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dEZyUWhNQTJEb2RDMFFTdU15YTBoUHc6MQ">
https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dEZyUWhNQTJEb2RDMFFTdU15YTBoUHc6MQ
</a>
It's crucial that those wanting a deep underground lab in the U.S.
support this organization, so if you weren't in DuRA, please join,
and if you were and missed the survey, please fill it out.

*** Cosmogenic Workshop
</h1> <p>
Whether an underground lab is built in South Dakota, Europe,
South America or elsewhere, cosmogenic backgrounds need to be
understood.  An International Workshop on Cosmogenic Activities
and Backgrounds will take place in Berkeley, CA on 13-15 April.

*** Improved Reactor Flux calculation; 3% shift
</h1> <p>
Mueller et al.,
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.2663"> arXiv:1101.2663 </a>
have recalculated the reactor
antineutrino spectrum including the latest information from
nuclear databases and a detailed error budget.  The error budget
is comparable to previous work, but the normalization for 235U,
239Pu and 241Pu has to be corrected by 3%.

</p><h1>
*** The reactor antineutrino anomaly
</h1> <p>
Previous reactor experiments were compared to an earlier reactor
flux calculation; Bugey-3, Bugey-4, ROVNO, Goesgen, Krasnoyarsk-I,
ILL, Krasnoyarsk-II, Palo Verde and CHOOZ.  With the new flux,
all experiments have a deficit of neutrinos, as shown in
Mention et al.,
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.2755"> arXiv:1101.2755 </a>.
Since some are closer than
100 m, A neutrino oscillation explanation implies a new
oscillation length, corresponding to delta msquared &gt; 1.5 eV^2.

</p><h1>
*** Will Project X get CD0 Soon?
</h1> <p>
There is a need for higher intensity for future neutrino
experiments, and other "Intensity Frontier" experiments as well.
CD0 is sometimes referred to as "mission need", but as with all
else, schedules are hard to make when (US) budgets are uncertain.

Not many people have spent 41 years studying neutrinos, but Ray
Stefanski has done just that.  Read about his impressive career

*** Doctoral Training Program in Neutrinos
</h1> <p>
The ECT Doctoral Training Program for Neutrinos in Nuclear-,
Particle- and Astro-Physics will take place 11 Apr - 17 Jun 11 in
Trento Italy.  See
