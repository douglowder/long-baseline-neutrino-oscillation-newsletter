*** NSF DUSEL not in President's budget for 2012
</H1> <P>
The Administration proposes to eliminate NSF funding for
planning and design for the proposed Deep Underground Science and
Engineering Lab (DUSEL) because the construction and operation of
such a large, costly, and complex particle physics facility is 
outside of NSF's core mission.  See page 30 at

*** Pumps at Homestake to stay on
</H1> <P>
The NSF has found $5M to keep the pumps at Homestake/DUSEL/Sanford
Lab on for the rest of the year.  The President's Budget has $15M
proposed for next year for the DOE to keep the pumps running 
through the end of Fiscal Year 2012.  In the meantime, the DOE, 
which has stated it is committed to LBNE, has to figure out if it 
wants to maintain the lab at Homestake and what to include.

<H1>
*** Marx Committee to study Homestake
</H1> <P>
The DOE has a new committee, chaired by Jay Marx (LIGO/Caltech)
and Mark Reichanadter (SLAC) to help define cost-effective options
for using Homestake.  8 scenarios for physics include LBNE-water
at 4850 and LBNE-argon at 800 level.  The other 6 involve double 
beta decay and dark matter at 4850, at 7400 and at SNO.  The first 
meeting is 13 April at SLAC with a report due 25 May 2011.

<H1>
*** PMT explosions
</H1> <P>
Will phototubes survive in a large water detector?  One way to 
find out is to predict how they implode and then test some in
an old torpedo test chamber.  The tests succeeded, but you won't
care about that as you watch the videos!

*** Neutrinos for Europe in 2012 to meet in Paris
</H1> <P>
The 2nd annual meeting of the NEu2012 Network, "Neutrinos for 
Europe in 2012", will be May 10, at the CNRS Headquarters Paris
in the context of the second Annual EUCARD Meeting (May 11-13).
See 
<A href="http://eucard.web.cern.ch/eucard/index.html"> http://eucard.web.cern.ch/eucard/index.html.  </A>
The main aim of 
the meeting is to progress in the direction of the road map for 
long-baseline neutrino physics in Europe, in view of recent
developments in the design studies EUROnu and LAGUNA LBNO and in 
view of the CERN strategy process to take place 2011 - Sep 12.

*** Leak in NuMI target so MINOS/Minerva off 
</H1> <P>
They were currently running in antineutrino mode, but the beam
will be off for at least eight weeks, it seems.  MiniBooNE runs on.

<H1>
*** Describing Neutrino Oscillations to the Public
</H1> <P>
It seems obvious to some people that if I start out with a muon 
neutrino at my source, and measure a tau or electron neutrino at 
my detector, that someplace in between it changed flavor.  In the
world of quantum mechanics, that is not what happened; rather the
flavor is projected as part of measurement.  We plot oscillation
probabilities as a function of distance, but do not say that 
something happened in between.  Popular writers often get this 
wrong, as in the last sentence on Double Chooz for Symmetry in:

*** Describing Neutrinos for the Public
</H1> <P>
A well written book, simply called "Neutrino" is available for those
aunts and grandparents who want to know what we do.  Written last
year by Frank Close, it is available on Amazon for under $15.
<A href="http://www.amazon.com/Neutrino-Frank-Close/dp/0199574596"> 
http://www.amazon.com/Neutrino-Frank-Close/dp/0199574596.  </A>
It goes
from Chapter 1's "Desperate Remedy" through Ray Davis' work.  It 
gets to Long-Baseline neutrinos with four pages on MINOS, 144-147.

*** CUSEL opens in China
</H1> <P>
China's first deep underground lab is now operational for dark
matter experiments. The vertical rock coverage of the lab, which
opened in December at the Ertan Hydropower Plant in Sichuan China
is 2400 m rock.

*** Beyond Three Neutrinos
</H1> <P>
New neutrino projects are concentrating on the current 3-neutrino
paradigm, and open questions include theta-13, the mass hierarchy,
the masses themselves, CP violation, and the Majorana/Dirac nature
of the neutrino.  But surprises are possible, and there are an
infinite number of ways the neutrino(s) could have properties out-
side this paradigm.  A BEYOND3NU workshop, which will study theory
and experiment reasons to think about such things will take place 
at Gran Sasso in Assergi Italy from 3-4 May 2011.

Another workshop on possibilities for short-baseline nu experiments
at FNAL will take place 12-14 May at Fermilab.
