<p>
</p><h1>P822 meeting DATE April 21st (Wednesday)</h1>
The meeting will be at Argonne Building 362, Room F108
from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm on Wednesday April 21st.
An agenda will be sent out in the February news.

<h1>Proposal revision due in May</h1>
Revised NUMI proposals are now due in May for the summer
Aspen PAC meeting.  We expect to produce 4 documents:
1. A joint physics overview motivating the NUMI
(neutrinos at the main Injector) program, including
solar neutrinos, atmospheric neutrinos, dark matter,
etc.
2. P803 (short baseline emulsion) rewrite with technical
specifications.
3. P822 (long baseline Soudan) rewrite with technical
specifications.
4. Conventional construction at Fermilab document,
specifying the extraction, the beam, service buildings,
the short baseline detector area, and so on.

<h1>CERN Future</h1>
A committee at Cogne in September 1992 reviewed the
present and future Cern program.  If all goes well,
CHORUS and NOMAD will begin data taking in 1994,
following the installation of the neutrino target
station in September 1993.  Also,"...Future options can
be considered for inside or outside CERN.  As an
increase in beam intensity is not possible, the only
possibility insider CERN is an increased target volume
e.g. 100 tons would give a factor of 10 in sensitivity.
A future option outside CERN would be a very long
baseline experiment: e.g. to Gran Sasso (730 km) or
Kamiokande (8750 km).  Both "inside" and "outside"
options should be taken seriously, and more detailed
studies are recommended."
No new date has been set for the workshop, but CERN
has communicated to Fermilab that it would like to know
what is going on at Fermilab in this area.  J.P. Revol
is the contact person.  He also has calculated possible
limits that can be achieved from CERN to Kamioka and
CERN to Gran Sasso (See Ellis below).  It looks like the
calculations assume no background and no systematic
error.

</p><h1>Atmospheric Neutrino workshop in Baton Rouge</h1>
A  workshop is being organized by Bob Svoboda to
compare experimental and theoretical neutrino fluxes
for atmospheric neutrinos.  Of course interpretation of
the results will also be reviewed.   The workshop is
May 6-8, 1993.  For info, contact 7605::svoboda.

<h1>SSC workshop on neutrinos</h1>
An SSC workshop on neutrinos will also be held,
possibly in May.  It is being organized by Jenny
Thomas.  Contact sscvx1::jthomas

<h1>P822 makes Science Magazine</h1>
A discussion of Fermilab's future prominently mentions
P822 in the Jan. 1 issue of Science.
