*** OPERA long-baseline experiment approved at CERN
</h1>
The CERN SPSC Committee considers the OPERA experiment to have a
potentially large impact on the understanding of neutrino
oscillations.  They recommended P318/OPERA for approval with the
condition of a number of technical questions like aging and
temperature stability to be clarified, and a list of milestones
and an appropriate time schedule be established in common by the
SPSC and LNGSC referees and in consultation with the Collaboration.

*** ICARUS/ICANOE loses NOE part
</h1>
ICARUS is building a 600 ton liquid argon detector.  The
ICANOE proposal was to interleave ICARUS modules with a solid
target/scintillation fiber calorimeter.  Currently the T600 module
is being equipped at Padua and will be operated in 2001.  The SPSC
congratulated ICARUS on its progress and awaits long tracks in
the calorimeter.   It is still a Neutrino Oscillation Experiment
(NOE) but without the solid target.

http://www.ba.infn.it/~now2000/views/slides/ </a>.
There were 1st results of Bahcall-Pinsonneault 2000 model,
Super-Kamiokande capabilities over 40 years, and the SMA solar
solution survives at 95%CL but not 94% (Suzuki slide 28).

*** Gold cheap -- Homestake mine to close
</h1>
This was found at
<a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/000911/n11520519_2.html">
http://biz.yahoo.com/rf/000911/n11520519_2.html </a>.
The historic (but inefficient) mine where solar neutrinos have
been studied for over 20 years is closing due to low gold prices.
Homestake, the oldest continually listed stock on the New York
Stock Exchange, said it would wind down operations of the
124-year-old mine over 16 months.  It is the company's namesake
mine, and the experiment is located about twice as deep as Soudan
or WIPP.  KGF, a gold mine in India where proton decay and deep
muons were studied in the 70's and 80's closed several years ago.

*** Goldstone - Neutrinos hitting the moon
</h1>
The Goldstone project is planning to study the highest energy
neutrinos which hit the moon by looking for radio emission.  They
have finished several runs using NASA/JPL's Goldstone Deep Space
Station near Barstow, California, using a 70 m telescope (DSS14)
to provide a trigger.  They require a coincidence offline in a
34 meter telescope (DSS13) which is 22 km away. This separation is
large enough to suppress terrestrial sources, and small enough so
they both lie within most lunar Cherenkov cones.   See

*** Goldhaber - Neutrino connection to vice-president candidate
</h1>
A theoretical QCD physicist <a href="http://www.hagelin.org">
(John Hagelin) </a> is running for
President in some states as a Reform Party Candidate.  An
experimental neutrino physicist would seem to be ideal to balance
the ticket?  He came close, choosing Nat Goldhaber, nephew of
proton decay/IMB pioneer Maurice Goldhaber as his running mate.

*** Real physics leadership
</h1>
Stan Wojcicki was elected another 3 years as MINOS spokesperson.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Good budget news
</h1>
The final FY01 US-DOE budget is said to have the highest numbers
from among the House/Senate/President's budgets.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Strong-mixing between Oxford and Cambridge
</h1>
MINOS now has collaborators from 32 institutions, just admitting
Cambridge University.   Back when quarks were big, Oxford and
Cambridge were known for their weak mixing.  Since Oxford and
Cambridge are both now on MINOS, the strong mixing in the MNS
matrix may be easier to understand.

As done in the previous Conferences, the programme will cover
topics on neutrino physics, astrophysics and cosmology.  See
