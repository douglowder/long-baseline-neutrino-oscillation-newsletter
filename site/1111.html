*** First data from Double Chooz reactor neutrino experiment
</H1> <P>
One of three new-generation reactor neutrino experiments for
theta_13, The Double Chooz experiment in France presented its 1st
results from ~100 days of data at the LowNu meeting in Korea.   A 
preliminary rate + shape analysis of the data indicated a hint 
for a positive value of theta_13:  sin^2(2q_13) = 0.085 � 0.029
(stat) � 0.042 (syst) at 68% CL.  Global fits which include 
MINOS, T2K, KamLAND, atmospheric and solar neutrinos indicate
theta_13 isn't zero at more than 3 sigma, though the allowed
range is fairly large.  Only the far detector is currently on,
but half of Double Chooz is not CHOOZ.

<H1>
*** RENO Inauguration
</H1> <P>
LowNu2011 at Seoul National University November 9-12 served as the 
official inauguration of the RENO experiment.  In the reactor 
experiment session on the first day, RENO gave a status report 
following the first result talk from Double CHOOZ and the Daya Bay 
status report.  RENO has been taking data since August.  On the 
last day, attendees were treated to a tour of YongGwang Nuclear 
Power Plant and both the near and far detector halls and control 
room for RENO.  It was a long bus ride but well worth it!  RENO 
will have a 3-sigma sensitivity to sin^2(2theta13) of ~0.05 with 
the data they will collect through March.  Their goal is to 
release results next summer at Neutrino2012 in Kyoto.

*** Intense interest in the Intensity Frontier
</H1> <P>
The registration in the 30 Nov - 2 Dec Intensity Frontier Workshop
in Rockville Md. was so intense that registration was closed a
few hours early.  But the plenary sessions will be available
on Readytalk, code 6639079. Full connection instructions/agenda at

*** Double Chooz off and off-off
</H1> <P>
A couple days after the Double Chooz result, there was a fire
alarm which caused a power outage, and Double Chooz was off for 
about a day.  There was no fire and no harm was done.  Of more
interest, about a week before the box was opened, there was a
period of 23 hours in which both reactors were off (i.e. off-
off), allowing a clean measurement of the background.  So half
of off-off is not off.

*** OPERA neutrino velocity paper submitted
</H1> <P>
In a subsequent test to the original OPERA neutrino velocity
measurements, a dedicated CNGS beam had a single extraction of four
bunches 3 ns long separated by 524 ns with 1.1e12ppp, or a total of
4e16 pot.  20 events passed cuts and the average time difference
was 62.1 +- 3.7 ns in agreement with the 57.8 +-7.8 ns in the 
original analysis.  This eliminates many suspected sources of 
systematic error associated with the beam.  On 17 Nov 11, the
paper was submitted to JHEP.

*** ICARUS looks for one form of evidence for superluminal nus
</H1> <P>
They looked at their energy distribution and found no
deformation from what was expected, in contradiction to the
idea of superluminal nus in the Cohen and Glashow model
for a weak currents analog to Cherenkov radiation.

*** Neutrinos and the speed of light
</H1> <P>
In a water Cherenkov detector, MeV and GeV neutrinos travel at
the speed of light, while light travels slower, due to the index
of refraction.  In loose analogy, one idea is that the dark-
energy equation of state in an expanding Friedman-Robertson-
Walker universe might cause nus to yield a truer measurement of 
Einstein's limiting speed.  See Susan Gardner,

*** NOvA pivoter test of Full Height Engineering Prototype (FHEP)
</H1> <P>
NOvA blocks will be built horizontally but then must be lifted to
their vertical orientation perpendicular to the NuMI beam at Ash
River.  A full height engineering prototype was built at Argonne 
and is being tested with the pivoter in the CDF building at FNAL.

*** Watch NOvA being built
</H1> <P>
Keep an eye on the NOvA experiment as it gets built, using webcams.
Look now and you will see an almost empty building.  Start with

*** LBNE beam and detector decisions - half done
</H1> <P>
To move forward, LBNE needs to narrow the range of options that it
is studying.  This month, the Project Office, the Beam and the 
Conventional Facility teams decided the beamline configuration 
known as MI-10 Shallow would be the reference design for LBNE.  
This decision came after carefully studying both the MI-60 Deep 
and the MI-10 Shallow alternatives, including the technical risks 
and the cost differences between the two.  The schedule is for 
LBNE to reach consensus on a far detector technology choice, 
between Liquid Argon and Water Cherenkov, before its collaboration 
meeting in December.

*** Milla Baldo Ceolin 1924-2011
</H1> <P>
She had been a protagonist of particle physics for more than fifty 
years.  She was the first female professor at Padova, and she 
organized and ran the popular "Neutrino Telescopes" series of 
meetings in Venice for many years.
