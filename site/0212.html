<h1>Long-Baseline news,  December 2002 </h1>

<p> <h1>
*** KamLAND; 86.8+-5.6 expected (no oscillations), 54 events seen
</h1>
This confirms the LMA (large mixing angle) solution for solar 
neutrinos.  See 
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0212021"> hep-ex/0212021 </a>
for  "First Results from KamLAND: 
Evidence for Reactor Anti-Neutrino Disappearance"

<p> <h1>
*** K2K; 80.1 +6.2-5.4 expected (no oscillations), 56 events seen
</h1>
Long-Baseline accelerator experiments were proposed to look for 
neutrino oscillations.  The first published oscillation analysis 
has appeared and will be in PRL.  It is "Indications of Neutrino 
Oscillation in a 250 km Long-baseline Experiment",

<p> <h1>
*** Haiku, 85 syllables received, 51 are any good.
</h1>
That works out to 3 out of 5.  Others claim they have started 
their neutrino haiku but haven't finished yet.  Some will appear
in future issues.  New submissions will always be welcomed.

*** Neutrinos and Causality predictions
</h1>
There were 5 papers on the preprint server citing KamLAND before 
IT was posted.  To some, this was evidence for causality 
violation.  However this was predicted by Pakvasa, which is not 
causality violating.

*** LowNu Workshop, Paris, May 19-22 2003
</h1>
The Fourth LowNu (solar neutrino detection below 1 MeV) workshop 
will be held in Paris, 19-22 May at College de France.  It will 
be organized by the APC, the new Paris lab which gathers 
physicists/astrophysicists.

*** Neutrino Phases for Pedestrians
</h1>
Harry Lipkin 
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0212093"> hep-ph/0212093 </a>
reminds us that Stodolsky's theorem 
simply and clearly resolves the issue of neutrino phases.  
Neutrino oscillations are experimentally observable only as a 
result of interference between neutrino states with different 
masses and THE SAME ENERGY.  All interference effects between 
neutrino states having different energies are destroyed by the 
interaction between the incident neutrino and the detector.

*** George Marx; started International Neutrino Conferences
</h1>
Prof. George Marx, a leading figure in Hungarian astro-particle 
physics died at the age of 76 on 2 December 2002 in Budapest. 
Beyond his personal contribution to the discovery of lepton number 
conservation in 1953 and the derivation of an astrophysical upper 
bound to neutrino mass in 1972, Marx played a key role in starting 
the series of Neutrino Conferences (the 1st was at Lake Balaton).

*** JHF/HIPA now to be called J-PARC
</h1>
The 50-GeV accelerator complex under construction in Japan has 
been given the acronym J-PARC (Japan Proton Accelerator Research 
Complex).  There will be n LOI for the nu program soon after 1/1.

*** NUFAC report endorses ICECUBE, NUSEL
</h1>
See 
<a href="http://www7.nationalacademies.org/bpa/What's_New.html"> 
http://www7.nationalacademies.org/bpa/What's_New.html </a>
for the report of the Neutrino Facilities Advisory Committee
They say that the time has come for both ICE-CUBE, a km^3 
detector at the South Pole, and a National Underground Science 
Lab, where a multitude of neutrino experiments can take place.

*** Answer to (Boris Kayser's) homework
</h1>
See section 2 of 
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0211134"> hep-ph/0211134 </a>.
The essence of the puzzle is 
not the Majorana character of the neutrinos, but the chirally-
handed character of the charged weak currents. Here is a DIRAC 
version: Suppose a DIRAC numu interacts with some target in 
whose rest frame (t) it has - helicity, and makes a mu.  Now 
run faster than the nu. In your frame (s), the nu has + helicity. 
One frequently hears Dirac nus with +("right handed") helicity do 
not interact. If that were really true in all frames, then in 
frame s nothing would happen.  Answer: The amplitude for the nu 
interaction is indeed Lorentz invariant, so if that interaction 
yields a mu as seen in frame t, it yields one in s too. The 
Lorentz-invariant amplitude is a dot product of 2 4-vector 
currents: a leptonic current, and a target/recoil current. In 
frame s, the leptonic current is highly suppressed relative to 
its size in frame t, as naively expected when a nu has + helicity. 
However, in frame s the target/recoil current is correspondingly 
enhanced, to just such a degree that the dot product of the 2
currents is the same in frame s as in frame t.

*** Plato's fire
</h1>
The non-Abelian discrete symmetry A4 is also the symmetry group 
of the regular tetrahedron, one of five perfect geometric solids 
known to Plato who associated it with fire.  In 
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0211393"> hep-ph/0211393,</a>
Ma discusses implications for the neutrino mass matrix.

They do not observe 
interest in combining the 2 as presently planned.  But minor 
modifications (NuMI baseline or nu-bars), leads to richer physics.
