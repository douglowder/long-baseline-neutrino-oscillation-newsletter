*** NuSTORM gets stage 1 approval at Fermilab
</h1> <p>
This is a proposal to build a mu storage ring &amp; neutrino beam from
3.8 GeV muons + near &amp; far detectors.   It's part muon accelerator
development and part sterile neutrino search.  The FNAL Program
Advisory Committee gave stage 1 approval at its June Meeting.

*** LBNE + LBNO
</h1> <p>
Discussions about joining forces are taking place between the
mostly U.S. LBNE collaboration (Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment)
and the mostly European LBNO collaboration (Long-Baseline Neutrino
Oscillation).  Nobody has proposed calling it LBNI.

*** Summary talk at 2013 Lepton Photon
</h1> <p>
At the summary talk of the 2011 Lepton Photon conference, we were
given a statistics lesson by Michael Peskin about why we shouldn't
believe that the Higgs mass is 125 GeV or that sin^2(2theta13) is
about 0.10.  In response, I wrote an imaginary discussion about
statistics.

An interesting point on Muruyama's slide 25 this year was using a
dimensional analysis of the SM Lagrangian, the first order
correction, the only dimension 5 operator, is a Majorana mass nu.

*** Daya Bay II evolves into JUNO
</h1> <p>
A new large reactor neutrino experiment could measure the energy
distribution with a detector placed such that L/E was near the solar
mass squared difference, corresponding to 60 km from powerful
reactors.  A plan for such an experiment, previously Daya Bay II,
but now called JUNO is 60 km from reactors under construction at
Taishan and Yangjiang, west of Hong Kong in China.  A 20 kiloton
liquid scintillator sphere would have an estimated signal event
rate of 40 per day.  It would use 15,000 20 inch PMTs.  Designs are
underway and a decision is expected in 2014-15.

*** RENO-50 evolves, but isn't RENO-47
</h1> <p>
RENO-50 is a similar project planned in South Korea, which had
a June workshop to develop a proposal for a new reactor experiment.

They have changed the
detector design to 18 kton of unloaded LS with high QE 15000 20-inch
PMTs with 67% surface coverage.  A candidate site is found at the 450
meter high Mt. Guemseong, 47 km from the Hanbit (old name: Yonggwang)
nuclear power plant. They are considering an inclined tunnel to obtain
a deeper location for solar neutrinos and geoneutrinos.

*** Accident at JPARC delays T2K run
</h1> <p>
On 23 May, due to a malfunction of the beam extraction system of the
50 GeV synchrotron, proton beam melted a gold target.  Radioactive
material then leaked into the hadron experimental hall and some
workers were exposed to radiation.  Ventilation fans carried some
material outside the facility, but radiation dose monitors showed
no signatures.  All J-PARC facilities have been shut since the
accident.  An investigation and review of safety practices is being
conducted before the facility starts up again.

*** U.S. House and Senate offer language on LBNE
</h1> <p>
Appropriate committees have language about LBNE that may or may
not ever be in a budget.   House: "(This) includes $8M for project
engineering &amp; design activities of LBNE and its alternatives, $8M
above the request.  The recommendation includes no funding for
long-lead procurements or construction activities for the LBNE
project. The Committee recognizes the importance of this project
to maintaining American leadership in the intensity frontier &amp; to
basic science discovery of nu &amp; SM physics. However, (we) also
recognize that LBNE construction must be affordable under a flat
budget scenario. As such, the Committee supports the Office of
Science's challenge to the HEP community to identify an LBNE
construction approach that avoids large out-year funding spikes or
to identify viable alternatives with similar scientific benefits
at significantly lower cost."  Senate: "The Committee also
recommends $30M for the Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment, which
includes $10M for R&amp;D and $20M for project engineering and design.
Research in neutrinos represents the next frontier of particle
physics and this experiment remains a top priority for the U.S.
and international physics communities.   The Committee restores
funding for this project to mature the design, develop better cost
estimates, and encourage international collaborators to make
financial contributions."  House has $12M for SURF; Senate $15M.

*** Nigel Lockyer &amp; LBNE
</h1> <p>
Nigel Lockyer has been appointed the new director of Fermilab.  In
the following interview with Nature (and elsewhere) he acknowledges
the key role of LBNE in the future of Fermilab.

*** Hyper-K moving ahead, not tied to ILC?
</h1> <p>
A June meeting discussed plans for building a large new water
Cherenkov detector for neutrino physics and underground physics in
Japan.  Quotes from the meeting:  "It is often stated that we need
a global strategy for the next generation neutrino experiments. In
the world, we need both Hyper-K w/ ~300km baseline nu beam and a
liquid Ar TPC w/ &gt;1000km baseline."  and "Both ILC and a big nu
detector (Hyper-K) w/J-PARC are priorities.   Note that we do not
intend to select one between two. We want to push both."
