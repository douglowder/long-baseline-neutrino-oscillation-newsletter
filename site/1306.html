*** NuSTORM gets stage 1 approval at Fermilab
</H1> <P>
This is a proposal to build a mu storage ring & neutrino beam from 
3.8 GeV muons + near & far detectors.   It's part muon accelerator 
development and part sterile neutrino search.  The FNAL Program 
Advisory Committee gave stage 1 approval at its June Meeting.

*** LBNE + LBNO 
</H1> <P>
Discussions about joining forces are taking place between the 
mostly U.S. LBNE collaboration (Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment) 
and the mostly European LBNO collaboration (Long-Baseline Neutrino 
Oscillation).  Nobody has proposed calling it LBNI.

*** Summary talk at 2013 Lepton Photon 
</H1> <P>
At the summary talk of the 2011 Lepton Photon conference, we were 
given a statistics lesson by Michael Peskin about why we shouldn't 
believe that the Higgs mass is 125 GeV or that sin^2(2theta13) is 
about 0.10.  In response, I wrote an imaginary discussion about 
statistics.

An interesting point on Muruyama's slide 25 this year was using a 
dimensional analysis of the SM Lagrangian, the first order 
correction, the only dimension 5 operator, is a Majorana mass nu.

*** Daya Bay II evolves into JUNO 
</H1> <P>
A new large reactor neutrino experiment could measure the energy 
distribution with a detector placed such that L/E was near the solar 
mass squared difference, corresponding to 60 km from powerful 
reactors.  A plan for such an experiment, previously Daya Bay II, 
but now called JUNO is 60 km from reactors under construction at 
Taishan and Yangjiang, west of Hong Kong in China.  A 20 kiloton 
liquid scintillator sphere would have an estimated signal event 
rate of 40 per day.  It would use 15,000 20 inch PMTs.  Designs are 
underway and a decision is expected in 2014-15. 

<H1>
*** RENO-50 evolves, but isn't RENO-47 
</H1> <P>
RENO-50 is a similar project planned in South Korea, which had 
a June workshop to develop a proposal for a new reactor experiment.

They have changed the  
detector design to 18 kton of unloaded LS with high QE 15000 20-inch 
PMTs with 67% surface coverage.  A candidate site is found at the 450 
meter high Mt. Guemseong, 47 km from the Hanbit (old name: Yonggwang) 
nuclear power plant. They are considering an inclined tunnel to obtain 
a deeper location for solar neutrinos and geoneutrinos.

*** Accident at JPARC delays T2K run 
</H1> <P>
On 23 May, due to a malfunction of the beam extraction system of the 
50 GeV synchrotron, proton beam melted a gold target.  Radioactive  
material then leaked into the hadron experimental hall and some 
workers were exposed to radiation.  Ventilation fans carried some 
material outside the facility, but radiation dose monitors showed 
no signatures.  All J-PARC facilities have been shut since the 
accident.  An investigation and review of safety practices is being 
conducted before the facility starts up again. 

<H1>
*** U.S. House and Senate offer language on LBNE 
</H1> <P>
Appropriate committees have language about LBNE that may or may 
not ever be in a budget.   House: "(This) includes $8M for project 
engineering & design activities of LBNE and its alternatives, $8M 
above the request.  The recommendation includes no funding for 
long-lead procurements or construction activities for the LBNE 
project. The Committee recognizes the importance of this project 
to maintaining American leadership in the intensity frontier & to 
basic science discovery of nu & SM physics. However, (we) also 
recognize that LBNE construction must be affordable under a flat 
budget scenario. As such, the Committee supports the Office of 
Science's challenge to the HEP community to identify an LBNE 
construction approach that avoids large out-year funding spikes or 
to identify viable alternatives with similar scientific benefits 
at significantly lower cost."  Senate: "The Committee also 
recommends $30M for the Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment, which 
includes $10M for R&D and $20M for project engineering and design.  
Research in neutrinos represents the next frontier of particle 
physics and this experiment remains a top priority for the U.S. 
and international physics communities.   The Committee restores 
funding for this project to mature the design, develop better cost 
estimates, and encourage international collaborators to make 
financial contributions."  House has $12M for SURF; Senate $15M.

*** Nigel Lockyer & LBNE 
</H1> <P>
Nigel Lockyer has been appointed the new director of Fermilab.  In 
the following interview with Nature (and elsewhere) he acknowledges 
the key role of LBNE in the future of Fermilab.

*** Hyper-K moving ahead, not tied to ILC? 
</H1> <P>
A June meeting discussed plans for building a large new water 
Cherenkov detector for neutrino physics and underground physics in 
Japan.  Quotes from the meeting:  "It is often stated that we need 
a global strategy for the next generation neutrino experiments. In 
the world, we need both Hyper-K w/ ~300km baseline nu beam and a 
liquid Ar TPC w/ >1000km baseline."  and "Both ILC and a big nu 
detector (Hyper-K) w/J-PARC are priorities.   Note that we do not 
intend to select one between two. We want to push both."

This site for neutrino reactor research, such as SONGS, is off.
