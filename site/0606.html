*** Daya Bay Press release
</h1>
The Reactor Neutrino Experiment at the Daya Bay reactor outside of
Hong Kong is now the largest U.S. - China collaboration ever.  11
U.S. groups have now joined this collaboration.  Its goal is to 
measure the neutrino mixing parameter theta-13.

*** BENE report published for future neutrino experiments in Europe
</h1>
The "Beams for European Neutrino Experiments" Networking Activity
has issued its report as CERN Yellow Report CERN-2006-005 and as
CARE-2006-009-BENE ECFA/06/242.  It is an outline and a plea for a
timely neutrino accelerator and detector R&D program.  It is

*** Next for BENE - NUFACT 2006
</h1>
The next relevant dates for the continuation of European nu 
studies:  1) the 4th meeting of the ISS in Irvine Aug 21-23
at NuFact06 where the context of our international collaborative 
effort will take shape.  [Register for NUFACT at
<a href="http://nufact06.physics.uci.edu/"> 
http://nufact06.physics.uci.edu/ </a> ]  2) a new open meeting of the 
BENE SG at CERN in October, tentatively planned for Oct 23, when 
a) the implications of the CERN Council Strategy Document 
will have become explicit b) proper preparation for CARE06 meeting 
3) CARE06 meeting 15-17 Nov in Frascati preceded by BENE 13-14.

*** P5 (in Peru?) recommends NOvA long-baseline neutrino experiment
</h1>
In Peru, every license plate has "P5" at the top.  This stands for 
Plato Proceso para Peruano Principado (chiste).  Peruvian Director
of FNAL is pleased the Particle Physics Project Prioritization 
Panel recommended "the start of construction on the NOvA neutrino 
oscillation experiment using the NuMI beamline at Fermilab. This 
experiment is complementary to the other neutrino experiments on a 
worldwide basis and represents the next step for the U.S. in a 
phased international program aimed at measuring the remaining 
parameters of the neutrino oscillation matrix, determining the 
mass ordering among the neutrino mass eigenstates, and finding out 
whether neutrinos violate the CP symmetry."

*** DUSEL progress for underground lab
</h1>
Conceptual Design Reports for Henderson and Homestake were turned 
in to the NSF in late June.  TDR is expected in FY07 and $3M R&D 
funds are available in FY07 for physics.  A Property Donation 
Agreement for Homestake was completed in April and the property 
formally transferred to South Dakota in May.  There will be an 
early implementation program 2007-2012 with South Dakota funds.

*** Cascades appeal to NSF denied, upheld & rescinded
</h1>
I've heard different versions of this, but there was an NSF appeal 
about the decision on the Cascades Washington DUSEL site, and it
might or might not be back in the running with a CDR due May 2007.
My understanding is that appeals deal with process not substance.

*** MINOS new results on delta msquared_32.
</h1>
An updated neutrino oscillation result was presented at Nu06 from
1.27 10^20 POT.  Delta m^2_32 = 2.72 +.38 -.25(stat) +- 0.13 (sys)
10^-3 eV^2, and sin^2 2-theta_23 = 1.00 - 0.13(stat) +- 0.04(sys)

*** Donut controversy
</h1>
Fermilab Today used doughnuts to describe the collider energy, but
it is well known this metaphor is more appropriate to neutrinos.

*** MiNERvA gets CD-0 and an MRI from the NSF
</h1>
The Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science has granted CD-0
approval to the MINERvA experiment.  CD-0 approval is a statement 
detailing the scientific need for a DOE project.  MINERvA is a low 
energy neutrino scattering experiment which uses the NuMI beamline 
at Fermilab.  MiNERvA was also Selected by the National Science 
Foundation to Receive Major Research Instrumentation Grant in the 
amount of $777,485.

*** Santa Fe Mayor addresses Neutrino 2006
</h1>
The honorable David Coss, mayor of Santa Fe New Mexico is
a biologist.  But he carefully read the material that was sent
to him about neutrinos and noted that it said, "Neutrinos have
mass, but only under certain circumstances."  This reminded him
of many towns in Northern New Mexico, which have mass, but only
under certain circumstances, i.e. when the priest shows up.

*** New law of Physics at Neutrino 2006
</h1>
During the History session at Neutrino 06, Herald Kruse, the only 
surviving member of the Savannah River experiment which discovered 
the neutrino, reminisced on his experiences on the experiment and 
received an award.  At dinner he commented that it was a new law of 
physics, outlive everyone else and you win an award.

*** Neutrino 2006 Organizer named New Mexico Science Adviser
</h1>
Tom Bowles did such a good job organizing Neutrino 2006 that 
Governor Bill Richardson named him as his scientific adviser.
