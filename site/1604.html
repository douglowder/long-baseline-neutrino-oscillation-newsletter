*** Improving neutrino physics at J-PARC/T2K
</H1> <P>
A new facility in J-PARC to upgrade the Main Ring accelerator has
been approved. This facility will house a new power supply system
with which the repetition rate of the Main Ring will be doubled,
resulting in 750 kW beam power, with the potential to exceed 1 MW.
The T2K collaboration is considering improvements in physics
sensitivity, especially for CP violation, with an extension of the
running time with beam power of 1.3 MW. An Expression of Interest
for the T2K extension was presented to the J-PARC PAC in Jan.

<H1>
*** U.S. House and Senate can't agree how much to add to LBNF
</H1> <P>
They agree the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility deserves more than
requested.  The Senate provides an extra $10M, the House $5M.

*** Fire at Fermilab recycler, no weasel or marten involved
</H1> <P>
On Shakespeare's Birthday, the recycler anode supply power
transformer caught fire, causing a glitch that took out several
other systems.  To see the fire, go to slides 5 & 6 at
<A href="https://indico.fnal.gov/getFile.py/access?contribId=0&resId=0&materialId=slides&confId=12023"> 
https://indico.fnal.gov/getFile.py/access?contribId=0&resId=0&materialId=slides&confId=12023
</a>
Fermilab was able to quickly return beam to users in a few hours,
but there is no recycler available for slip stacking, so the NuMI
intensity is about half.  They may be able to restart the recycler
on 11 May.  This is unrelated, to the weasel (marten?) at the LHC.

Re: small animals, would you name a baby Bison MiniBisoNE?

*** Booster Neutrino Beam at Fermilab exceeding flux goals
</H1> <P>
While the neutrino rate at NuMI is low for a while, the Booster
neutrino beam has already far exceeded the FY16 integrated number
of protons on target.  See slide 3 of the previous Indico link.
As of 1 May, they had 275 e16 protons, compared to 125 e16 design.

<H1>
*** A phased array for radio detection of neutrinos
</H1> <P>
Looking for a radio signal of high energy neutrinos using the
Askaryan effect, balloon flight ANITA-1 saw 1 event with a
background of 1.1, ANITA-2 saw 1 with a a background of .97, and
ANITA-3 in 2014 has a blind analysis underway.  ARA has 3 test
stations deep in the Antarctic Ice and will have more 2017-2018.
But a phased array for PEV and UHE nus could see a correlated
signal while the noise is uncorrelated.  Phasing 400 antennas
could provide good energy overlap with Ice-Cube while being
sensitive to GZK neutrinos.  They ran tests on antennas in
existing boreholes in Greenland to improve GZK sensitivity by 100.

<H1>
*** Two new Minerva results relevant for long-baseline searches
</H1> <P>
1) Evidence for NC diffractive production of neutral pions, a
surprise process that is not in current generators but can be a
background for nu_e appearance using a hydrocarbon target.  2)
First measurement of CC K+ production.  This is an irreducible
background from atmospheric neutrinos for proton decay to a
neutrino and a K+.

*** This month's new word:  scotogenic
</H1> <P>
Well new to me.  It means caused by dark matter.  A scotogenic
model in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07777"> arXiv:1604.07777 </A>
gives maximal theta23, delta_CP is pi/2
or 3pi/2.  Another scotogenic model is found in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.05569"> arXiv:1604.05569 </A>.

<H1>
*** Latin American Neutrinos
</H1> <P>
A workshop at Fermilab focused on past and future Latin American
contributions to neutrino physics, with a focus on DUNE.
<A href="https://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=11392"> 
https://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=11392
</a>
Representatives from eight countries were involved.

<H1>
*** Civil Construction progress for FNAL Short-Baseline program
</H1> <P>
MicroBooNE is running, but buildings are under construction for
the short-baseline program near detector (SBND) and far detector
(ICARUS).  They will be complete at the end of calendar year 16.
To increase the intensity of the booster beam, a longer horn &
refurbished power supply could double the event rate.  It costs
$6.5M; with design starting now it could be in operation in 2019.

<H1>
*** Hyper-K open meeting 10-11 July, Queen Mary U in London
</H1> <P>
The Hyper-Kamiokande project is being designed to be the next
decade's flagship experiment for the study of nu oscillations,
nucleon decays, and astrophysical neutrinos. An International
Open Working Group Meeting for Hyper-K will be held 10-11 July.
