*** Critical Decision zero for several neutrino projects in US
</h1>
(from Robin Staffin)  This is to inform the High Energy Physics 
community that the Director of the Office of Science, Dr. Ray 
Orbach, has approved the Mission Need Statements for the following 
potential new medium scale initiatives.
<br>
* A generic accelerator-based nu_e appearance experiment to 
measure neutrino mixing and to probe the neutrino mass hierarchy
<br>
* A generic reactor-based neutrino detector to precisely measure
neutrino mixing (theta_13 )
<br>
* A generic ground-based dark energy experiment
<br>
* A generic neutrinoless double beta decay experiment to probe the
Majorana nature and an absolute mass scale of neutrinos.  
<br>
As 
announced previously, the request for the approvals of the 
following two new medium scale initiatives will shortly follow:
<br>
* A high-intensity neutrino beam (Super Neutrino Beam) for neutrino
CP-violation experiments
<br>
* A generic underground dark matter experiment to search for direct
evidence of dark matter
<br>
Note that an approval of Mission Need (commonly referred as CD-0
approval) does not equate to an approval to proceed with the project, 
although it is a required step in the approval process for any new 
major facility or experiment. Rather, it is an expression of intent
by the Office of High Energy Physics to the Department of Energy 
that we plan to pursue these specific scientific topics and/or 
facility options.  The potential projects may be located in the U.S. 
or in other countries; and there may be several options for the 
technology chosen to carry out the experiment or to build the 
facility. If these initiatives move forward, decisions such as 
technology choice and siting will come later in the approval process. 
The DOE's project approval process has been moving in parallel with 
scientific advisory processes (SAG, P5, HEPAP etc) in order to be 
ready to move forward expeditiously. The recommendations from the 
scientific advisory processes will be one of key inputs in next steps 
to come.  We look forward to continuing interactions with the High 
Energy Physics community to bring these exciting scientific 
opportunities to fruition.

*** In 1995, Critical decisions were "key decisions"
</h1>
This newsletter shouldn't be referenced, but it is appropriate to 
repeat this Key Decision guide from September 1995:
<br>
KD-0: "Permission to think" - One can work on conceptual design.
<br>
KD-1: "Permission to think deeply" - One can develop Title I - 
Means that major permitting has been accomplished, usually.
<br>
KD-2: "Permission to do detailed designs" - One can develop Title II -
Detailed engineering construction drawings.  All permitting in place.
<br>
KD-3: "You can build it" - Until now, no money can go for anything 
real - up to this point it's all paper.
<br>
KD-4: "You can use it" - It may exist, but you can't use it until DOE
approves that it is o.k. to use it.

*** Chooz
</h1>
The best limit for the third mixing angle, theta-13, comes from 
the reactor neutrino experiment CHOOZ which ran in the 90's.  
Although it ran for two years, improved sensitivity could be 
achieved in just a few months with a new experiment, since both 
reactors now run constantly at full power.

<p> <h1>
*** Double Chooz
</h1>
A location for the near detector has been identified which seems 
to be free of groundwater from the nearby river.  It is next to a 
hill where the hard rock continues sloping into the ground.  
Plans are to increase the near detector depth from 30 m to 40 m.
If this inexpensive experiment is promptly funded in the US and 
Germany, it could start in fall 2007.

<p> <h1>
*** Triple Chooz
</h1>
Chooz was located in a tunnel to a decommissioned underground 
reactor near the current Chooz reactors.  That decommissioning will 
be complete in 2010, & the site would be available, in 
principle, with no civil construction.  
A $50M 200 ton detector would reach sin^2 2 theta_13 < 0.01.

*** Beams for European Neutrino Experiments & ISS
</h1>
BENE documents can be found at

We expect the International Scoping Study (ISS) to set up a longer 
term World Design Study (WDS) at NuFact06, late August.  At CERN, 
the BENE05 yearly meeting Nov 22-25 focused on 1) preparation of 
our Yellow Report to the Symposium called in Orsay (Jan30-Feb1) by 
the CERN Council Strategy Group.  BENE is striving to have 
accelerator neutrinos included in the strategy 2) preliminary 
steps towards a FP7 (7th Framework Plan) Proposal to the European 
Community to fund, together with all EU funding agencies, a full 4 
years Design Study of the next European accelerator Neutrino 
facility.  This would be the European aspect of the WDS.

*** Poster Session Deadline for Neutrino 2006
</h1>
The deadline for submitting abstracts for Nu06 posters is 1/15/06.
The organizers encourage younger participants to play an active role 
in the conference by presenting their work in the poster session.

*** Two Germanium detectors meet for the first time
</h1>
The Heidelberg Moscow Germanium detectors in the Gran Sasso, and 
the IGEX Germanium detectors in the Canfranc tunnel were each 
pioneer neutrinoless double beta decay experiments searching for 
evidence of Majorana mass of the neutrino. Now these detectors are 
sitting in a new room together at Gran Sasso being prepared for 
their common mission in the first phase of GERDA. So far no 
arguments between them have been reported.

*** MINOS milestone
</h1>
MINOS now has 1.0E20 protons on target. K2K's final publication
was based on 8.9E19. K2K's numbers were:  expected accelerator nu
events - 151, observed - 107, number of apparent one-ring numu
CC QE candidates (used for energy spectrum determination) - 57
