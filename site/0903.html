*** Earthquake near Gran Sasso
</h1> <p>
A serious earthquake in Italy damaged parts of L'Aquila which is
close to the Gran Sasso lab.  We wish the best for our neutrino
friends there.

*** Neutrino 2008; Archiving old Meeting web sites
</h1> <p>
Meetings now post transparencies on their website and this has
made printed conference proceedings functionally obsolete.  (Some
editors like to have them anyway.)  However, not all websites get
maintained.  Many older meetings at the neutrino meetings page
give bad links.  Spires will archive meetings, and Neutrino 2008
has done so:
<a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/econf/C0805263/">
http://www.slac.stanford.edu/econf/C0805263/.  </a>
This
link should be good for many many years.

*** Neutrino Interactions Meeting 18-22 May in Barcelona
</h1> <p>
Nuint09 is the 6th in a series of workshops concentrating on
low energy neutrino interactions.  It will be in Spain this
Spring.

*** WIN 2009 Meeting to be at Gran Sasso in September in L'Aquila
</h1> <p>
The 22nd International Workshop on Weak Interactions and Neutrinos
(which alternates with Neutrino Conferences) will be held in
L'Aquila Italy from 14-19 Sept. 2009.

*** Neutrino Summer School Meets in July 6-17 at Fermilab
</h1> <p>
The Summer School aims to cover the full breadth of neutrino
physics and will present an opportunity for participants to
concentrate on the many aspects of the field that our community
will be addressing over the next few decades. They encourage
young researchers, either currently engaged in neutrino physics,
or those considering it to attend the School. The school is
aimed at advanced graduate students and recent post-docs.

*** Neutrino Factory Workshop Meets in Chicago in July 20-25.
</h1> <p>
Just after the summer school is the 11th in a series of workshops
to study future accelerator-based neutrino facilities.  It will
be at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago (where less
is more), except the first day will be at Fermilab.
Early registration fee till 1 May at

*** NNN09: Meeting on Nucleon Decay/Neutrinos October in Colorado
</h1> <p>
NNN09 will be the tenth of a series of workshops to discuss
experiments that go beyond the reach of current projects, as well
as the theory work that motivates and describes such advances.
New detectors will explore proton decay lifetimes over 10^35 y,
and advance our understanding of the neutrino sector, including
mass hierarchy, additional oscillation parameters, CP violation,
supernova dynamics, and high energy cosmic neutrino sources.

*** Neutrino Meeting at Luxor (no not Las Vegas)
</h1> <p>
In my travels, I would rate the Valley of the Kings as the most
interesting place I've ever been, despite the lack of neutrino
physicists there.  That will be rectified in November, when the
CTP International Conference on Neutrino Physics in the LHC
Era will be held in Luxor Egypt.

*** Low Emittance Muon Collider Meeting June 8-12 at Fermilab
</h1> <p>
This 4th workshop focuses on the development of high-luminosity
muon colliders using extreme muon beam cooling, where many
constraints on muon collider designs are alleviated with beams of
smaller emittance and lower intensity. The workshops covered topics
related to proton drivers, cooling, cooling demonstration
experiments, bunch recombination, muon acceleration, collider
lattices, interaction-point design, site boundary radiation, and
detector concepts for energy frontier and Higgs particle studies.
The workshops are sponsored by Fermilab's Technical Division and
Muons, Inc.

*** New Fermilab Lecture Series "Extreme Beam" Meetup
</h1> <p>
A new lecture series at Fermilab will explore myriad intensity
opportunities.  The intensity frontier offers a unique path for
21st-century particle physics.  Lectures will address topics
including neutrino physics, muon physics, hadron physics and
innovative accelerator and detector technologies for the
intensity frontier.

*** Meeting on Supernova Physics and DUSEL 16-17 Sep at UCLA
</h1> <p>
If you want to see a Supernova underground, you should probably
use neutrinos.  This workshop will consider supernova dynamics,
neutrino properties and supernova, the detector of nus at DUSEL,
and the DUSEL lab and supernova detector design/strategies.

*** Photonis to stop making phototubes
</h1> <p>
In a March press release, which is bad for particle physics, they
announced they will stop making tubes by July 2009.
