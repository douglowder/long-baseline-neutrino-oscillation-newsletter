*** Super-Kamiokande accident
</h1>
While refilling, a tube, most likely on the bottom, imploded 
and set off a chain reaction destroying much of it to about a 
depth of 2 m below the current (~2/3) water level.  Waveshifter 
plates are shattered, cables perhaps shredded, etc. The water is 
full of antimony and other hazardous chemicals. About 7000 of the 
11000 22-inch phototubes (~$3000 each) were broken. See pics at

*** Super-Kamiokande to rebuild
</h1>
Super-K will rebuild the detector. "There is no question."  The 
strategy may be the following steps, which will be proposed and 
discussed by the Super-K and K2K collaborations:
1. Quick restart of the K2K experiment. <br>
(1) clear the safety measures suggested by all committees;<br>
(2) reduce the density of the photomultiplier tubes by ~1/2;<br>
(3) use the existing resources;  <br>
(4) resume K2K, goal ~ 1 year;<br>
2. Preparation for the JHF-Kamioka experiment.<br>
(1) Restore the full detector using state-of-the-art techniques;<br>
(2) The detector will be ready by the time of JHF commissioning;

*** Super-Kamiokande rebuild support appreciated
</h1>
"To achieve our objective is formidable but we are determined to 
do so. We certainly need your encouragement, advice and help. I 
should appreciate it very much if you could support our effort as 
you have kindly done so before." Best regards, Yoji Totsuka,
director, Kamioka Observatory [ICRR, Univ. of Tokyo, E-mail:

*** Bin Laden lauds neutrino detector blast
</h1>
Bakhrubabad, Afghanistan - Speaking from his hidden mountain 
stronghold, Osama bin Laden praised the destruction of the 
Super-Kamiokande neutrino detector. The terrorist leader said 
neutrinos are "...an abomination on the face of God," and 
termed the search for neutrino mixing  "...idolatry, which will 
be smashed beneath the fist of righteousness."

*** MINOS 1/8th done
</h1>
Plane 64 recently hung.  184 PMT's in 1st full VME rack.

Also, the tunnel boring machine for the NuMI tunnel has reached 
the MINOS shaft, and should be finished before Christmas.

<p> <h1>
*** Particle Production Experiment 907 approved.
</h1>
This is a proposal to measure Particle Production in the Meson 
Area Using Main Injector primary and secondary beams.  One goal 
is to measure particle production off NuMI targets using 120 
GeV/c protons with sufficient accuracy to predict the NuMI 
neutrino spectrum.  Similar efforts at CERN are NA49/HARP.

<p> <h1>
*** MICE
</h1>
A letter of intent for an International Muon Ionization Cooling 
Experiment has been submitted.  This is a next step for a 
neutrino factory based on a muon storage ring.  The draft is at

*** CERN workshop Jan 16-18 on neutrinos and proton decay
</h1>
A workshop on "Large Detectors for Proton Decay, Supernovae and 
atmospheric neutrinos and low energy neutrinos from high 
intensity beams" will be held at CERN 1/16-18.  A low energy beam 
from the Cern Superconducting Proton Linac (SPL) is among topics.

*** S17 (relevant to solar neutrino Boron flux error).
</h1>
A new measurement of S17, the 7Be(p,gamma)8B cross section, 
appears in Junghans et al., 
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/nucl-ex/0111014"> nucl-ex/0111014.    </a>
They report
S17(0)=22.3+-0.7(expt)+-0.5(theor) eV-b.  This is a bit higher 
than the value in BP calculations, and indirect measurements are 
significantly lower; ~17.8

*** K2K data
</h1>
Through this summer, K2K, the one long-baseline neutrino 
experiment with data 
(<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0110034"> hep-ex/0110034), </a> 
has observed 44 events 
versus 63.9 expected in the absence of mixing.  (Don't just say 
63.9 events are expected.  Mixing is expected now.)   Fogli et al, 
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0110089"> hep-ph/0110089, 
</a> show the consistency with neutrino oscillations 
from Super-K's atmospheric results and combine results.

*** NuTEV gets high Weinberg angle.
</h1>
Or everyone else got a low Weinberg angle.  Or some new neutrino 
physics... NuTeV measures the neutral current to charged current 
rate for neutrinos and ant-neutrinos  Their sin^2 th-W = 0.2277
+-.0013(st)+-.0009(sy) is 3 sig > world average.
