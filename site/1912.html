<H1>Long-Baseline news, June 2019 </H1>
<P>

*** LBNF/DUNE and PIP-II in FY19-20 budget
</H1> <P>
According to AIP, funding for LBNF and DUNE is up from $131M to
$175M.  The estimated total cost of the project is $1.85B. An
additional $30M is for infrastructure at SURF.   Funding for the
Proton Improvement Plan II, needed for LBNF/DUNEâ€™s nu beam at
Fermilab, is up from $35M to $60M. That project is expected to
cost about $720M.  The total of $2.5B is within the June 2019 HEP
project guidance for all DOE project costs of $2.6B.

*** PIP-III would come after PIP-II
</H1> <P>
The 2014 P5 report called for a 1.2 MW beam power upgradeable to
multi-megawatt power.  Replacing the booster could get to 2.4 MW.
A new working group co-chaired by Bob Tribble and Gianluigi
Arduini will assess science opportunities and technology choices.
Their goal is to submit a white paper before Snowmass 2021.

<H1>
*** MicroBooNE results 
</H1> <P>
MicroBooNE has published its first PRL, the first measurement of 
the double differential cross sections on argon.  
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09694"> arXiv:1905.09694 </A>
They've also presented upper limits on the production of heavy
neutral leptons decaying to muon-pion pairs:

<H1>
*** New Neutrino Review in Review of Particle Physics (PDG)
</H1> <P>
<A href="http://pdg.lbl.gov/2019/reviews/rpp2019-rev-neutrino-mixing.pdf">
http://pdg.lbl.gov/2019/reviews/rpp2019-rev-neutrino-mixing.pdf
</A>
A new review of Neutrino Masses, Mixing and Oscillations now
appears in the Review section of the PDG.  It is written by
M.C. Gonzalez-Garcia and M. Yokoyama.

<H1>
*** Draw me a neutrino
</H1> <P>
KM3NeT is sponsoring this contest and you have until 15 March.
See 
<A href="http://wos.ba.infn.it/">
http://wos.ba.infn.it/
</A>.
Participants must reside in one of the
countries hosting the contest:  France, Georgia, Greece, Italy,
Morocco, Russia, South Africa, Spain and the Netherlands.  As in
many things neutrino, there are three groups:
Group 'electron neutrino': pre-schools and primary schools
Group 'muon neutrino': secondary schools
Group 'tau neutrino': adults

<H1>
*** Register for Neutrino 2020, 22-27 June 2020 - Don't be late.
</H1> <P>
<A href="https://conferences.fnal.gov/nu2020/">

Poster abstract submission
is now open through 1 Apr.  The early bird registration deadline
is 28 Feb. and registration closes 20 May.  The deadline to apply
for financial assistance is the Ides (15th) of March.

<H1>
*** Register for NuFACT 2020, 23-29 August 2020 - Don't flipflop.
</H1> <P>
The 22nd International Workshop on Neutrinos from Accelerators
will take place in Cagliari, Sardinia, Italy.  When you register,
you may be asked your shoe size.  They will put a pair of beach
flipflops in the bag as a workshop gift.

*** Neutrino and Collaboration meeting lists for 2020
</H1> <P>
<A href="http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/numeetings.html">

</A>
There had been 42 meetings listed in 2019.  A link at the top
gives dates for some neutrino collaboration meetings.  Currently
included are SBND, Super-K, NOvA, DUNE, MicroBooNE, Minerva & T2K.

<H1>
*** Development of LiquidO, an opaque scintillator detector
</H1> <P>
The CHOOZ experiment ended when the attenuation length of light 
became too short.  Double Chooz, Daya Bay & RENO succeeded by
making Gd doped scintillator that kept a long attenuation length.  
Now Double Chooz spokesperson Anatael Cabrera is working on how an
opaque scintillator & dense array of fibers could be advantageous.

*** Double Beta Decay APPEC Committee Report for Europe
</H1> <P>
<A href="https://www.appec.org/news/neutrinoless-double-beta-decay-report-from-the-appec-committee">
https://www.appec.org/news/neutrinoless-double-beta-decay-report-from-the-appec-committee
</A>
and 
<A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04688">
https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04688 </A>.  4 recommendations involved 
neutrinoless double beta decay searches being a top priority and
the need for support, underground space and theoretical assessment.
Two others called for a multi-isotope program at the highest level
of sensitivity should supported in Europe and that a program of
R&D should be devised on the path towards the meV scale for the
effective Majorana mass parameter.

<H1>
*** ARAPUCA
</H1> <P>
Ana Amelia Machado and Ettore Segreto have been awarded the 2019 APS 
Early Career Award for Instrumentation for the invention and development 
of the ARAPUCA photon detector:
