<p> </p><h1>*** More K2K data
</h1>
At ICHEP and NNN, K2K showed data for 30% more running than at
Nu2000, 2.6 10^19 pot.  They report data/no-osc-expect for fully
contained 27/40.3; out fidvol 16/17.2 Outer-D contained 10/30.1;
Outer-D crossing 13/14.4.  The run ended June 22 and will resume
January 10, 2001.  Earlier data can be found at
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0008047"> hep-ex/0008047 </a>

*** K2K Near Detector errors
</h1>
K2K has three near detectors with vastly different systematics
and factor of 50 variation in statistics.  It is interesting to
note that the errors on the predicted event rate from the three
detectors are quite similar.  They are 40.3 +4.7-4.6 (1kton water),
41.4 +6.2-6.4 (Mu counters); and 40.0 +5.2-5.5 (scint fibers).

<p> </p><h1>*** US Nus and World Report (WIPP)
</h1>
A similarly named weekly magazine reported on the Carlsbad
meeting on page 62 of its June 26 issue, and the possibility of
putting an underground physics lab down in the salt mine with
nuclear waste.   The neutrino background from the 6.2 million
ft^3 of waste is negligible.  They also hope that a project which
demands low radiation will allay public worry about the waste.

*** Neutrino Factory study 2
</h1>
A BNL site-specific study of a 20 GeV (mu) nu factory has begun.

<p> </p><h1>*** Is the neutrino better off today than 8 years ago?
</h1>
It's convention season, so conventional neutrino beams are being
looked at.  Most calculations suggest that high intensity
conventional beams fall short of the capabilities of neutrino
factories, but Burt Richter comes to the opposite conclusion in
"Conventional Beams or Neutrino Factories:  The Next Generation
of Accelerator-Based Nu Experiments",
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0008222"> hep-ph/0008222 </a>.
Another
look is Dick et al., "A comparison of the physics potential of
future long-baseline nu oscillation experiments",

<p> </p><h1>*** Neutrino Source workshop in Hawaii October 2-6
</h1>
An international workshop on "New Initiatives in Lepton Flavor
Violation and Neutrino Oscillations with Very Intense Muon and
Neutrino Sources" will be held at the University of Hawaii on
Oct. 2-6, 2000. It is supported by the NSF and the Japanese
Society for the Promotion of Science.

Attendance is limited by the size of the conference facility, and
registration will be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis.
Young physicists especially invited (some support is available).

<p> </p><h1>*** What neutrino mass do you measure/limit in tau decay?
</h1>Presumably it's a mixture of nu-2 and nu-3.  The same thing is
limited in mu decay 100 times better.  The PDG plans to clean
things like this up by 2002.

<p> </p><h1>*** Push down Ue3 limit in reactors?
</h1>
The Chooz/Palos Verde reactor limits (~10%) on Ue3 are themselves
limited by systematic errors.  	In a proposal for a two-reactor
experiment at Krasnoyarsk (250m &amp; 1100m), many systematic errors
cancel and the ratio is controlled down to 0.5%.

In this B-L model with 3 active and 3 sterile nus,
intergenerational mixing is suppressed, so only mini-BooNe would
see appearance.  Nutau disappearance is in principle observable.
