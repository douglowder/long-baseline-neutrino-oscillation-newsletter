*** Lower neutrino funding at CERN</h1>
In its efforts to produce a budget for 2002, the CERN management is considering
now to cut the budget of R&amp;D for high intensity proton machines and
Neutrino Factory down to... 0.3 MCHF! This is down by a factor 5 with respect
to the 2001 budget and by an even larger factor below the level that a
healthy R&amp;D programme would require. Even if the R&amp;D on future
neutrino sources is to be shared with other laboratories in Europe, this
cut will make it difficult to set-up these collaborations. A manifesto
on the subject has been developed at the web page

*** Homestake Deal Blasted in New York Times</h1>
In a front page article in the January 3 <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New
York Times, </a>the Homestake "deal" releasing Homestake Mining Company
of liability for the possible future site of the National Underground Physics
Lab is described as a $30-40M giveaway to the company. It is not in the
interest of good environmental policy. The government will "assume any
and all liability relating to the mine and laboratory, including liability
for damages, reclamation, the costs of response to any hazardous substance"
and mine closing.
<h1>
*** Mining for pork in South Dakota</h1>
The bill for the Homestake lab was described as a "sweetheart deal" and
a "stealth amendment" in an editorial in January 4th's Chicago Tribune.
They accused Senator Daschle of "hypocrisy" for previously arguing in favor
of environmental protections and against limitations on liability. To make
clear that they didn't like the bill, they said it "stinks."

*** Highlights of NNN-Baton Rouge</h1>
NUSL will start with small projects. Searches for neutrinoless double-beta
decay and dark matter "absolutely compelling" motivations for initial operation.
Also, progress with KamLAND almost ready for data, and Borexino coming
along, with several other approaches for p-p solar neutrino detection under
development. Theoretically, there is renewed interest in neutron-antineutron
oscillations as well as proton decay. There were many ideas for low-energy,
off-axis, or narrow-band neutrino beams for oscillation studies. There
are several ideas for detection of supernova neutrinos with the goal of
extracting the neutrino temperature for the different species.
