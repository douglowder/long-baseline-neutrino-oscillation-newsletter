*** Neutrino 2020 (Chicago) converted to online conference
</H1> <P>
(paraphrased from the organizers) Neutrino 2020 will be held as an
online-only conference, on or close to the original dates.  There
will be online poster presentations.  More details on the dates,
conference format, registration reimbursement, & the registration
process for the free online meeting will be available soon. Please 
continue to submit your poster abstracts. For those who booked a
room at the Hyatt, cancel your reservation directly through the
hotel.  Rooms in the conference hotel can be canceled without
penalty up to 48 hours before the reservation date.

*** NOW workshop canceled, other nu meetings in a state of flux

The Neutrino Oscillation
Workshop will switch to 2021 or 2022.  NuFACT (Sardinia) and ICHEP 
(Prague) are still currently scheduled, but the web pages report "active 
monitoring of the situation". I'll monitor the situation as best I can
for conferences and workshops at the neutrino meetings page

*** More neutrino seminars online
</H1> <P>
One possible silver lining is that many more neutrino seminars 
around the globe are available online.  For example, the Fermilab
neutrino seminars are now only on zoom.  This development isn't
new, but common technical problems are being solved more quickly.

*** New Global Fit for nu oscillations favors normal order
</H1> <P>
See Capozzi et al in 
<A href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08511">
https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08511.  
</A>
dchi2 = delta(chisquared) = 10 for normal order (NO) from oscillation 
data.  
Nonoscillation data (cosmology, beta decay and 0nu2b decay if
Majorana) gives addition dchi2 = 2.2 and Sum(mnu) < 150 meV at
2σ .  In combination with a range of cosmology assumptions, the 
normal preference is 3.2-3.7 sigma.  Also Sum m_ν < 120-690 meV.

<H1>
*** RANT - 5 sigma again
</H1> <P>
It seems to me that the oft-quoted and little understood 5-sigma
criterion for "discovery" in HEP is based on misunderstanding both
the calculation and the meaning of a chance probability.  Now the
American Physical Society has chosen to honor several outstanding
policy advocates during 2019 with the "5-Sigma Physicist Award".
5 sigma, really?  They chose 16 individuals for their  high-impact 
advocacy activities out of 55,000 APS members, or 3.5e-4 of us.
The chance probability of a 5-sigma effect is 3e-7, ~1000 times
less.  It is less than one-in-a-million, which is close to a joke.

<H1>
*** LEP reanalysis converges on 3 neutrinos
</H1> <P>
Several small corrections in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02067"> arXiv:1912.02067 </A>
led to reduced Bhabha cross
section with respect to that used by the LEP experiments. This
increases the integrated luminosity, thus decreases the hadronic
cross section and leads in turn to a larger number of light nus.
With luminosity corrections reported in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01704"> arXiv:1908.01704, 
 </A>
these changes
modify the number of light nus from the Z to Nν=2.9963±0.0074. The 
20-y-old 2σ tension with the Standard Model is gone.

<H1>
*** 90 is the new 70
</H1> <P>
On 28 March, neutrino physicist and Nobel prize winner Jerry Friedman
celebrated his 90th birthday.

<H1>
*** Jon Paley elected co-spokesperson for NuSTEC
</H1> <P>
NuSTEC, or the Neutrino Scattering Theory Experiment Collaboration, 
focuses on neutrino-nucleus interactions.

*** ANNIE sees first neutrinos
</H1> <P>
The Accelerator Neutrino Neutron Interaction Experiment at FNAL
has its first nu events.  The Gd-loaded water detector plans to 
efficiently detect the neutrons that arise in nu interactions.
