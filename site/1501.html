*** ELBNF LOI submitted to Fermilab PAC
</H1> <P>
<A href="http://www.fnal.gov/directorate/program_planning/Jan2015Public/LOI-LBNF.pdf">

The global neutrino community worked together to prepare this
letter of intent to pursue an accelerator-based long-baseline
neutrino experiment, as well as neutrino astrophysics and nucleon
decay, with an approximately 40-kt (fiducial mass) modular liquid
Argon TPC detector located deep underground and a high-resolution
near detector.  A goal is the deployment of the first 10-kt
detector on the timescale of 2021, followed by expansion to the
full detector size as soon as possible.  527 signed the LOI.

*** First ELBNF collaboration meeting
</H1> <P>
There were 278 registrants for the first collaboration meeting of
the Experiment at the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (ELBNF) at
FNAL on 22-23 January.  Slides are available at
<A href="https://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceOtherViews.py?view=standard&confId=9209">  
https://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceOtherViews.py?view=standard&confId=9209
</A>
The institutional board met and endorsed the LOI and started the
process of establishing a collaboration structure.

<H1>
*** Last LBNE institutional board meeting
</H1> <P>
On 28 Jan, the previous LBNE collaboration's institutional
board met and voted to turn over its assets to ELBNF and dissolve.
The former LBNE project will transition from one project to two;
a Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility and the detector.  When this
has progressed, DOE has asked for a "CD-1 refresh" to understand
the new scope.

<H1>
*** Last ELBNF collaboration meeting?  (as named)
</H1> <P>
There was sentiment that ELBNF was not a good name for the new
collaboration, so a naming contest is underway.  Send suggestions
for that name to 
<A href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4d202c383f34632a222229202c230d2c2321632a223b">  <span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="563b3723242f78313939323b37381637383a78313920">[email&#160;protected]</span> </A>
by 12:00 noon central time
on Friday 6 February.  Don't suggest ETNAN - Experiment That Needs
A Name.  Anything else is ok.  The new collaboration will then
vote among those choices and the IB will eventually finalize a
name, likely before the next collaboration meeting in April.

<H1>
*** Double Chooz catches up with its name
</H1> <P>
Double Chooz was the first reactor neutrino experiment to see a
deficit due to theta-13, but it started with just a far detector.
Now the Near Detector is running and it really is a "Double" Chooz.
Ironically, the Chooz Far Detector is behind the security fence,
since it was near the site of a decommissioned underground
reactor.  And the Near Detector isn't behind the security fence!

<H1>
*** Juno storms ahead. (as named)
</H1> <P>
Weathermen in the U.S. have started naming winter storms, and the
record-breaking storm that dumped 3 feet of snow on Boston was
called Juno.  Sorry about that.  It won't happen again.  Meanwhile
the Juno reactor nu experiment in China laid a foundation stone
for a new lab for a large detector to measure the hierarchy.  U.S.
members are considering a Pelletron based calibration system.  A
2019 data start is the goal.  Approval will likely depend on a
China contribution to the U.S. program at a commensurable level.

*** NESSiE changes its name to NESSiE
</H1> <P>
The January Fermilab PAC meeting heard from NOvA, ELBNF (or P1062),
the Short-Baseline Program including LAr1-ND, MicroBooNE and
ICARUS, Captain-BNB, Captain-Minerva, Annie and NESSiE.
<A href="https://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=9287">  
https://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=9287
</A>
The NESSiE Collaboration proposed a spectrometer in the Booster
beam to determine disappearance behavior at the 1 eV mass scale.
It stands for Neutrino Experiment with SpectromenterS in fErmilab.
The last E used to stand for Europe.  Since OPERA has started to
dismantle its spectrometer this January, a call has been opened
by INFN to reuse it, but time is tight for a decision.

*** Neutrino Platform Meetings at CERN
</H1> <P>
Meetings of the CERN Neutrino Platform are scheduled for
Thursday afternoons.  To join the mailing list for the meetings,
contact

<H1>
*** NOvA status
</H1> <P>
A retrofit of NOvA to replace some faulty cooling hoses was
completed in November at which point routine operations with 14 kt
began.  Uptime is routinely >95%.  Exposure so far is about
2e20 pot for the full detector mass, or about 1/3rd of a TDR year.
First results are expected before this summer with an update
around the time of the next shutdown, ~fall 2015.

<H1>
*** Neutrino Collaboration meeting date list
</H1> <P>
A list of neutrino collaboration meeting dates was collected and
has been linked to the "Neutrino Meetings" page at the top.

Let me
know if it is useful enough to try to maintain.  Input welcomed.
