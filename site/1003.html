<H1>Long-Baseline news, March 2010 </H1>
<P>

*** Did NuMI switch back to Neutrinos from Anti-nu?
</H1> <P>
The NuMI beam for MINOS and Minerva ran with the horns set to 
focus negative particles from October 2009 through Mar 22 2010.  
1.8e20 protons on target (POT) were delivered, to better study 
antineutrinos in the MINOS near and far detectors.  Analysis is 
proceeding on the measurement of oscillation parameters with 
anti-nus, led by Donna Naples, Jeff Hartnell and Justin Evans.

<H1>
*** Did Minerva finish installation?
</H1> <P>
The Fermilab Minerva cross section experiment finished installing 
its 120 track plus nuclear target modules in mid March.  They 
expect to have a water target in May and a liquid Helium target 
by September.  Their run plan is for 4e20 POT in the "low energy" 
beam, and 12e20 POT during the NOvA era.  The fiducial volume is 
3 ton CH,0.2t He, 0.15t C, 0.7t Fe and 0.85t Pb.

<H1>
*** What does MINOS say about theta13?
</H1> <P>
MINOS previously published an analysis of electron nu appearance 
in the NuMI beam using 3.1e20 POT in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.4996"> arXiv:0909.4996.  </A>
On 9 April, 
Lisa Whitehead will give a seminar on the analysis of 7e20POT at 
BNL; Gregory Pawloski at SLAC and Ryan Patterson at FNAL.  On 12
April, Anna Holin will talk at CERN.

*** Does Borexino see Geo-neutrinos?
</H1> <P>

Geo-neutrinos come from beta decays of natural isotopes in the 
earth.  I call them non-cosmic rays.  With 0.25 kton-yr, Borexino
sees 9.9 +4.1 -3.4 events, or an observation at 99.997%CL.  The
rate is 3.9 events/100ton-yr.  3TW core geo-reactor rejected @95%.

<H1>
*** What is the RENO experiment?
</H1> <P>
RENO (REactor Neutrino Oscillations) is 1 of 3 reactor anti-nu
disappearance experiments which hopes to take data in 2010 and
increase the world's sensitivity to theta-13.  It uses six 
reactors at Yonggwang South Korea located 1557, 1456, 1396, 1381, 
1414 and 1490 meters from its far detector.  A detailed Proposal 
and Technical Design Report is now available at 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.1391"> arXiv:1003.1391.

*** Has ArgoNeut been rigged out at Fermilab?

It ended its 5 month run in the NuMI beam on 22 February.

*** More Questions; SPC report released for CERN/Europe
</H1> <P>

</A>
The Report of the SPC Neutrino Panel was presented to the CERN 
Council in March.  The Council had asked questions, such as, "What 
is the view of the SPC on the importance of precise measurements 
of the neutrino oscillation parameters, in particular the CP 
violating phase and mass hierarchy?", "What is the view of the SPC 
on the overall value of the International Design Study for the 
future of (a neutrino factory)?  Should CERN take a more active 
role in enabling the study to reach its goals, irrespective of 
where such a facility would be sited?"  "What other high intensity 
neutrino facilities are technically possible and how would they 
address the measurements above?", "What should be the involvement 
of CERN in studies of those facilities, in particular with regard 
to the planned LHC upgrades?", "What is the view of the SPC on the
merit of a European strategy in this phase of nu experimentation
and whether it should have a place on the future CERN road map?"

<H1>
*** Some Answers in SPC report for CERN/Europe
</H1> <P>
Answers in context are in the report, but here's some text: "After 
intensively studying hadron flavor physics for many decades, a 
comparable effort to study lepton flavor physics and determine all
the nu oscillation parameters as precisely as possible is the 
logical next step."  "It appears today very likely that without a
nu factory several questions will remain unanswered."  "A CERN-
based program in direct competition with the Japanese and American 
ones would be of interest only if it can be timely or demonstrably
superior in performance.  Otherwise, participation by European(s) 
in those programs could be usefully supported at CERN."  "No 
global strategy exists concerning accelerator-based nu facilities."

<H1>
*** Some Recommendations in SPC report for CERN/Europe
</H1> <P>
<ul>
<li> Stronger CERN links with the European neutrino community.
<li> Neutrino groups in PH and AB departments, if possible.
<li> Regular workshops.
<li> Support for costing superbeam, beta beam, nu factory options.
<li> Development at CERN of a high power target facility.
<li> Finish MICE & show feasibility to produce 18Ne.
<li> Test beams for Detector R&D.
<li> High Intensity nu source in Europe unrealistic before 2020.
<li> Closely follow superbeams in Japan and USA.
<li> Concentrate on R&D for neutrino factory and/or beta beam.

*** Do neutrinos cause Toyotas to accelerate?

"Testing for the problem would involve putting vehicles in
front of a particle accelerator..."  No, but see:
