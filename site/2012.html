*** Daya Bay Completion Ceremony
</H1> <P>
The Daya Bay reactor neutrino experiment, which measured that
the "small" neutrino mixing angle theta_13 was nonzero, has
come to an end with a completion ceremony in December.

*** Short-Baseline Neutrino Program Multi-Institutional MOU
</H1> <P>
An MOU for collaboration by international partners on the FNAL-
hosted SBN program is now being processed for signatures by all
parties.  It memorializes organizational, managerial, funding and
participants' responsibilities to the program, as well as safety,
environmental and radiological regulations of the host.  It will
be signed by FNAL, LANL, UNICAMP-Brazil, INFN-Italy, STFC-UK and
Bern-Switzerland.   It may be the model for a future DUNE MOU.

<H1>
*** Neutrinos at Fermilab again in December
</H1> <P>
For the first time since the shutdown which was moved up at the
beginning of the COVID shutdowns, the Fermilab accelerator 
complex is making neutrinos again, for NOvA, MicroBooNE, etc.

<H1>
*** DOE Project Delays and Planning Delays
</H1> <P>
The pandemic situation has contributed to a number of DOE project
delays, which in turn postpones the need for new input on planning
from Snowmass and the next P5.  Magnet issues have delayed mu2e.
The CERN shutdown has affected accelerator, CMS & ATLAS upgrades.
There are cryostat procurement issues for SuperCDMS.  Some project
rebaselining will be needed.  The current DUNE/LBNF TPC is $2.6B;
CD2 is still planned for 2021.

<H1>
*** Snowmass2021 and P5 delay
</H1> <P>
After extensive community input, the Snowmass Steering Group, the 
Advisory Group, all conveners, & early career representatives met
and decided to delay the Snowmass process by one year.  Extending
the timeline of the Snowmass and P5 process would enable HEP's
scientific vision and the subsequent prioritization exercise, to
be fully informed by another year's anticipated progress.  The new
timeline calls for preliminary topical group reports in the Spring 
of 2022, Frontier Reports in late spring, the summer study at UW-
Seattle in summer 2022, and the Snowmas Book in October 2022.

*** Neutrino Telescopes meeting will be online 18-26 Feb 2021
</H1> <P>
The XIX International Workshop on Neutrino Telescopes will be 
online instead of its traditional Venice venue.  Registration is
free but mandatory.  
<A href="https://agenda.infn.it/event/24250/overview">

The opening session will host three Nobel prizes (Glashow, Barish,
Rubbia), Francis Halzen and the former INFN president F. Ferroni.

*** Gerda neutrinoless double beta decay experiment ends
</H1> <P>
The GERDA experiment designed to prove the existence of zero-nu
double beta decay is coming to an end. The collaboration has
evaluated and published in PRL the full data. Though no signal was
found, all goals set for the final phase of GERDA were achieved.
The progress made since 2011 is now being incorporated as the
search continues in the LEGEND experiment.

*** Nobel Prize Winner Jack Steinberger, 1921-2020
</H1> <P>
One of 3 1988 prize winners for the discovery of the mu neutrino,
he was also awarded the 1988 National Medal of Science by Reagan.

"3D-projection Scintillator Tracker (3DST) in SAND,
a DUNE Near Detector Subsystem"  The 3D-projection Scintillator
Tracker is the proposed equivalent of SuperFGD within Hyper-
Kamiokande for the SAND detector. 3DST will be made of 
scintillator cubes, each with three orthogonal holes for WLS
fibers for 3D projectional readout, with a unique capability
of event by event neutron detection.

"The Payload for Ultrahigh Energy Observations PUEO"
The Payload for Ultrahigh Energy Observations is a NASA Long
Duration Balloon that will launch in 2023 in Antarctica. PUEO is
able to detect radio emission of high-energy cosmic particles,
including high-energy neutrinos. Building off of the success of
ANITA, PUEO will have a lower energy threshold and improved
sensitivity to neutrinos.

"Radio Detection of Cosmic Rays" Detecting high-energy
neutrinos via radio detection allows for detection to not be
limited to clear nights, using arrays of digital radio antennas.

"Opportunities for multi-messenger observations with
neutrinos and tests of fundamental physics over the next decade"
IceCube-Gen2 will have five times the sensitivity for steady point
sources and detect astrophysical neutrinos tenfold than IceCube.
It would be monitoring approximately 8 gigatons of ice and
including a 500 km^2 of radio array.

"Ocean Bottom Detector"
This LOI describes the geoneutrino detector, geoscience, and ocean
engineering efforts put into OBD. The OBD project has improved
applied anti-neutrino science, and it is anticipated that a 1.5 kt
detector will be deployed eventually,
