</p><h1>Setback in Congress</h1>
The Main Injector came out of conference committee
at the lowest possible level ($15M House, $25M  Senate;
$15M Conference)  Previously there has been talk of a
DOE directive that there is to be no construction in
1993 unless there was more than $15M.

<h1>Kamioka atmospheric flavor ratio</h1>
At the Dallas meeting, they presented their flavor
ratio for 6.2 kton-years of running.  Their answer is
still .6, as it was at the Long baseline workshop for
4.9 kiloton-years: R = R(data/mc)
Kam-I+II ( 4.92 kty) R = 0.60 (+.07,-.06) (+.05,-.05)
Kam I+II+III (6.18 ) R = 0.60 (+.06,-.06) (+.05,-.05)

<h1>Macro thinking about filling GRAN SASSO Lab B</h1>
According to Doug Michael from CalTech, Lab B at
Gran Sasso could fit a 15 kiloton rpc plus iron plate
calorimeter aimed at CERN.  Such a detector could also
measure the neutral current to charged current ratio in
atmospheric neutrinos.  A prototype may be built and
tested at CERN over the next year or so.

<h1>A&amp;E firm costs to be estimated.</h1>
Ray Stefanski is organizing a small group of people
at Fermilab to answer the question, What "statement of
work" should be given to an AE firm for the neutrino
beam line design?  The group includes Steve Werkema,
Dave Johnson, Jorge Morfin and will interact with the
Construction Engineering Service Section (Nestander's
group).

<h1>Brookhaven Long Baseline presentation P889</h1>
The presentation by Al Mann and Mike Murtagh for a
long baseline experiment at the Brookhaven accelerator
was done very well, and the PAC had only trivial
questions, but the $12 Million beam line cost and $20
Million for 3 detectors was considered a hangup.  Soudan
would like to calibrate with neutrinos if that
experiment were to run, but we were told not to get our
hopes up.

<h1>Tsarev Visit</h1>
Vladimir Tsarev from the Lebedev Physical Institute
is visiting Fermilab, Argonne and Soudan to discuss
possible collaboration with P822.  Since the early
1980's, his group had published about 50 papers in
Russia on various aspects of Long Baseline Neutrino
Physics, and most recently a beam line from UNK to Lake
Baikal was actually engineered.  Since UNK has been
(unofficially) put off for an indefinite time period,
members of that group may be able to spend time thinking
about many of the issues facing P822.
