*** Direct Oscillatory evidence from Super-K
</h1>
At NOON2004, Super-K reported seeing a "dip" in their L/E 
analysis of atmospheric neutrinos for the first time.  Though 
expected for oscillations (versus decay or decoherence, for 
example), the L/E resolution limited this.  The method involved 
selecting events with the best L/E resolution.  A dip is clearly 
seen at 600 km/GeV.  This also measures delta m squared to be 
between 1.9 and 3.0 10^-3 eV^2 at 90% CL.  "See Oscillations" can 
now be crossed off the neutrino physics to-do list.

*** APS Neutrino Study Meeting and Web Page
</h1>
The APS DPF/DNP/DAP/DBP Neutrino Study will have its wrapup 
meeting sometime near the weekend of June 26-27, 2004 in Aspen.
A study web page is under development and ideally will exist.

*** DONUT results on tau neutrino
</h1>
The DONUT collaboration discovered the interaction of the tau 
neutrino with 4 events in 1999.  They have about 900 neutrino 
interactions in their emulsion, and they continue to scan and 
analyse their data.  They presently have identified two more 
trident events, for a total of 6 candidates, 6.3 expected.
They also have 8 charm seen, 6.9 expected.

*** JPARC budget
</h1>
The approval of the neutrino project in J-PARC for a five-year 
construction includes a total budget of 16 billion Yen approved 
by the cabinet in Japan.  Although the final official decision 
on any budget matter must wait until the approval by the House 
at the end of March, 2004, a change is unlikely.  The 
construction of the neutrino beam line will start in JFY04 
that starts 1-APR-04.  The JPARC budget is now 151 billion Yen.

*** Reactor Neutrino Experiment to study NuTeV anomaly?
</h1>
Experiments are being designed to measure theta_13.  Another 
idea, being developed by Janet Conrad & others is to collect 
enough nu-e elastic scatters in the near detector (and separate 
them from the inverse beta decays) to measure the Weinberg angle.
