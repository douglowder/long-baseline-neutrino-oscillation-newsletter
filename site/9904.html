<p> </p><h1>
*** Massive Attack
</h1>No, it's not about the Balkans, and neutrinos would be useless in
those mountains anyway.  An article in the March 13th issue of
New Scientist starts with neutrino mass overturning the Standard
Model, but continues more cautiously.  It goes on to call
Mini-Boone "definitive", and describes long-baseline experiments
in Japan and the US.  Some things are unintelligible, though.
Apparently "Massive Attack" is the name of a rock group, which is
unknown to teens (or their parents) outside of the British Isles.

*** Workshop on Neutrino Factories
</h1>Given the long time scales associated with the development of new
accelerators, now is the to time to begin work on a precision
neutrino physics program.  A workshop on neutrino factories based
on Muon Storage rings is being held to explore and evaluate
conceptual components and of the physics opportunities provided
by its neutrino beams.  See

*** Amanda sees atmospheric neutrinos
</h1>With the Amanda B array, they have analyzed 6 months of the 2.5
years of data.  With a 50 GeV cut, they see 17 clean upgoing
muons with no downgoing background.  The angular resolution is
about 2 degrees, as expected.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Clinton again mentions neutrinos
</h1>This week at presentations for the National Medal of Science, he
said, "You have sought answers to questions that few Americans
can even begin to understand, or others people ask but can't
answer -questions about neutrino physics and plant genetics,
about polymer composites and urban poverty. Your success in
illuminating the hows and whys of our world and raising the
quality of human existence have helped make the time in which we
live perhaps the most exciting in human history."

<p> </p><h1>
*** Reviewers of NuMI review suggest another review
</h1>A line from an old "Frank and Ernest" cartoon shows a scientist
with the line "Research, Research, if you'd done it right the
first time, you wouldn't have to do it again."  An External
Independent Review of the NuMI project for the US DOE was
submitted by the contractor, EG&amp;G on March 19, 1999.  The single
recommendation of the NuMI external Independent Review Team is
that the NuMI project undergo a complete external review.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Don't print this newsletter three times
</h1>In light of the review, I pull another sentence out of Clinton's
speech, "America's scientists should spend more time on
research, not filling out forms in triplicate."

<p> </p><h1>
*** Relativity probably ok
</h1>One explanation of the neutrino experimental data which is not
regular neutrino oscillations involves gravitationally induced
oscillations.  The suggestion is that the different flavors have
different coupling to the gravitational potential (whatever that
means.)  Rather than the usual dependence on L/E, one finds the
probability of such an oscillation depends on L*E and the solar
and atmospheric neutrino effects collapse to the same area of
parameter space.  A new paper (Fogli et al, below) looked at the
data with this idea and strongly constrains this possibility.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Joint OMNIS/MINOS meeting May 8th at Fermilab
</h1>The only two experimental groups which are anagrams of each other
plan to get together on May 8th at Fermilab to discuss whether
MINOS could be used as a supernova detector.

seeing this reaction, whatever the origin of the nuebar.
