*** Keeping email subscriptions up to date
</H1> <P>
It is getting harder to find new emails when people change
institutions, so please let me know if your address isn't up to
date.  If I have found a new email and you don't want the
newsletter anymore, just unsubscribe or ask me to do it.

*** Super-Kamiokande starts observations with Gadolinium
</H1> <P>
The rare earth gadolinium has been introduced into SK, starting a
new period of observations. The addition of Gd helps SK’s ability
to observe supernovae bursts in our galaxy.  It will also improve
discrimination of atmospheric neutrinos from antineutrinos and
reduce backgrounds for nucleon decay searches.

*** Snowmass Letters of Interest
</H1> <P>
In August many "Letters of Interest" were submitted for the
Snowmass 2021 HEP planning exercise, though more may dribble in.
LoIs are informal documents for the 1st stages of the study. They
will help conveners to prepare the 5-8 Oct 2020 Planning Meeting.
LoIs contain opinions, interests and proposals for further study.

Many nu
LoIs will be summarized in future LBNN newsletters.

*** MicroBooNE soon
</H1> <P>
We should soon hear from MicroBooNE whether the low energy excess
is due to electrons or photons, but I don't know when.  Possible
answers include no excess, all electrons, all photons, and a mix
with a rate the same, lower, or higher than MiniBooNE.

<H1>
*** Muon g-2 answer soon
</H1> <P>
We should soon hear an answer from the FNAL experiment measuring
the muon's g-2, but I don't know when.  Possible answers include a
value consistent with theory, an answer consistent with BNL E821,
a value in between, or a value larger or smaller than both.

In preparation, a four year
international collaborative effort of theorists has updated the
Standard Model prediction in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04822"> arXiv:2006.04822 </A>.  They get (g-2)/2 =
116591810(43)e(−11), 3.7 sigma smaller than the BNL measurement.

An outlier number in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12347"> arXiv:2002.12347 </A>
has recently been  revised a
bit.  I don't know any nu connection of all this, but who knows.

<H1>
*** New word for my spell checker - unobservability
</H1> <P>
In a nice talk on 0nu2beta decay at Nu2020, Petcov used the phrase
"well of unobservability" for the dip in the plot of the effective 
mass measured in 0nu2beta experiments vs the smallest neutrino
mass.  The two small masses and Majorana phases would conspire to
make it difficult to measure this small or vanishing term.  Note
that the effective mass is not the mass of anything.   The
neutrino was once thought to be unobservable, so we shall see.

<H1>
*** 2020 edition of PDG/RPP updates neutrino parameters
</H1> <P>
The new Review of Particle Physics from the Particle Data Group
is available as P.A. Zyla et al. (PDG), Prog. Theor. Exp. Phys.
2020, 083C01 (2020).  PDG values of neutrino mixing parameters are
[angles are sin^2(), mass differences Delta m^2 in eV^2] theta12 =
0.307 +- 0.013, theta23 = 0.545 +- 0.021, theta13 = 0.0218 +-
0.0008, dm_32 = 2.453 +-0.034 e-3, dm21 = 7.53 +- 0.18 e-5.  delta
= (1.36 +- 0.17) times pi.  
<A href="https://pdglive.lbl.gov/Particle.action?node=S067&init=0"> 
 https://pdglive.lbl.gov/Particle.action?node=S067&init=0</A>
Compared to 2019,
theta23 and dm_32 went up a little while delta went a bit down.

<H1>
*** Supernova power outage
</H1> <P>
For a brief amount of time, a supernova has an impressive power
output, mostly neutrinos.  Just before the big blast, there is a
possibly measurable flux of pre-supernova neutrinos, that could be
seen by KamLAND.  They send out a "presupernova significance"
signal which might indicate to other potential supernova neutrino
detectors to keep their livetime high, but due to a power outage
at KamLAND it was off for part of a weekend in August.

<H1>
*** DUNE Near Detector will not soon have a name.
</H1> <P>
A contest to name the DUNE near detector was interrupted as the ND
design matures.  Some of my favorites nominations were:  DESERT
(DUNE ECAL and Spectrometer Enclosing an aRgon TPC); SPINE (System
for Particle Identification in Neutrino Events); GArDEN (Gaseous
Argon Detector for Exploring Neutrinos); PARENT (Pressurized ARgon
and Ecal as duNe Tracker); PARS (Pressurized ARgon System); ARENA
(ARgon and ECAL Near-site Apparatus); SAHARA(Spectrometer Around
High-pressure ARgon Apparatus); FizzArD (Fizzy Argon Detector);

<H1>
*** Change in neutrino jobs page notifications
</H1> <P>
There has been a reduction in the number of new positions, so
the previous monthly notifications to a large set of neutrino
collaborations will cease.  Instead, I will now link the neutrino
jobs page in each month's newsletter, and highlight the additions
each month in color.
