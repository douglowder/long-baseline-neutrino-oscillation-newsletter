*** CERN long-baseline neutrino beam start delayed (CNGS)
</h1>

Scheduled for the 29 May 2006, the start of the CNGS beam
commissioning is delayed due to problems with the powering
of the PS accelerator magnet system.   The AB Department's 
Power Converter Group is working flat out with Siemens to 
return the PS's power supply system to working order. A 
problem appeared on the insulation of the power cables of 
the rotor of the rotating machine (photo) which supplies 
power to the PS magnets. To prevent more significant damage 
to the rotating machine, the AB Department, with the approval 
of the CERN Management, decided to shut down the PS which had 
started running on 15 May. Everything is being done to restart 
the accelerator on 26 June.  Presently, the latest DRAFT 
schedule foresees the start of CNGS on 10 July 2006.

The longtime measurer of solar neutrinos died at age 91.

*** EPP2010 - Shapiro at Fermilab User's Meeting
</h1>
Author of the EPP2010 report gave frank presentations at SLAC
and Fermilab where he offered his opinion that Fermilab pursuing
neutrino experiments such as NOvA was a mistake when it should
be concentrating on the Linear Collider.

For the impatient, go to 44 minutes into the program.

*** Oddone at Fermilab User's meeting
</h1>
Given discussion of EPP2010, he argued that NOvA was lined
up as a coherent international neutrino effort as recommended
by EPP2010.  P5 will discuss whether the complementary reach
of NOvA (to T2K) is a compelling physics program.  P5 has two
funding scenarios:  1.)FY07 +7%, FY08 +1.5%, FY09 +3%, and 10%
per year for the next administration; 2.) +7% per year. In the 
first scenario there wouldn't be a neutrino program at FNAL.

*** Rob Plunkett elected MINOS cospokesperson
</h1>
Fermilab's Plunkett was elected to a 3 year term leading MINOS.

*** MINOS back on after Fermilab shutdown
</h1>
There had been a water leak which caused MINOS to limp along with
its second horn for a short time just before the shutdown.  The
horn has been fixed and is as good as new.  Spare horns are
being built but are a few months away.

*** Daya Bay US meeting
</h1>
On June 2nd, the Daya Bay US collaboration invited members of the
US Double Chooz and Braidwood collaborations and others to consider
joining the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment in China near HK.

*** Double Chooz meets in a convent, gets surface facility
</h1>
The June Double Chooz meeting will meet at the "couvent des 
recollectines", at Givet (near Chooz in France).  This is so the 
God of Neutrinos will help.  EdF recently allowed a building 
outside the tunnel to be used for scintillator storage, but the
lack of U.S. support is delaying the project.

*** Colorado Senate supports DUSEL-Henderson surface facility
</h1>
On 1-Jun the Colorado Senate Bill SB206-229 was signed by Lt. 
Governor Jane Norton who was the acting governor of the day. 
The bill authorizes $20 million for construction of a surface 
facility for Henderson DUSEL.

<p> <h1>
*** Super-K is refilling
</h1>
They have replaced the phototubes missing since the accident.
2/3rds done.  Pakvasa's prediction that the next Supernova 
would be while Super-K was off seems to have been evaded.

<p> <h1>
*** DOE projects
</h1>
Several neutrino experiments can be found on the DOE projects
page: 
<a href="http://www.science.doe.gov/opa/13projects.html">,
http://www.science.doe.gov/opa/13projects.html, </a>
$135-150 
for EvA (NOvA); $15M for reactor neutrinos, $10M-$75M for zero-
nu double beta decay; and $12-18.3M for neutrino electric dipole 
moment (?).  The reactor neutrino number had been higher.

*** Results coming to Neutrino 2006 on MINOS, Super-K,...
</h1>
A fantastic Neutrino meeting is in store for those who will soon
meet in Santa Fe:  
<a href="http://neutrinosantafe06.com/"> http://neutrinosantafe06.com
</a>.   There will be
new results from MINOS and Super-K.  MiniBooNE will not have 
opened their box yet, but they are confident they will be able to
do so sometime early in the summer.

http://neutrinooscillation.org/numeetings.html </a>
   Note the
Nufact meeting in Irvine 24-30 August.  Separate are the NuFact
Summer school 15-22 August and the ISS meeting 21-22, both in
Irvine.  ISS group meetings are July 3-5 in Spain and at CERN
and July 26-28 in Princeton.   The 2nd International Workshop
on a Far Detector for the J-PARC Neutrino Beam will be held at 
Seoul National University 12-14 July.

Next they'll publish which hole the electron went through.
