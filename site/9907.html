*** MINOS undergroundbreaking
</h1>In one of his first acts as Fermilab Director, Mike Witherall
helped break wall for the MINOS laboratory at Soudan for the new
long-baseline experiment.  (see photo at

His instructions to the collaboration
were "Just go do it and tell us what the answer is."  There was a
videotape from Congressman Oberstar, and representatives of DOE,
NSF and the University of Minnesota.  Dating herself to at least
the late 1970's, UMinn Vice President for Research Dr. Christine
Maziar said, "We Golden Gophers do it underground."

*** Final Results - Chooz reactor neutrino Experiment
</h1>No evidence for nu-ebar disappearance.  90% limit .10 (mixing) at
high mass, 7 10^-4 eV^2 at large mixing.   See Apollonio below.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Data from SAGE Solar Neutrino Experiment
</h1>8 years data gives 67.2 (+7.2-7.0)(+3.5-3.0)SNU, half the SSM.
Oscillation fits are shown.

*** ICARUS + NOE = /I canoe (can you canoe?)/ICANOE
</h1>A freak July windstorm hit the Soudan/Boundary Waters Canoe area.
Soudan operations were not affected, but 12 million trees fell
over, hampering canoers.  At about the same time in Europe, the
ICARUS and NOE collaborations joined forces for the CERN/NGS
long-baseline neutrino proposal which is due in September.  Much
of the design work (and the name) is preliminary.

*** New nus from mu mus amuse.
</h1>The highlight of the Lyons neutrino factory meeting was a wine
tour of Beaujolais.  That caused a real coming together of ideas,
both on the machine and the physics sides.  At the meeting, 3
schemes became one, from the target downstream, with only the
proton driver being different.  From  24 R&amp;D areas, 4 were
selected for high priority investigation, targeting, pi and mu
capture, phase rotation and cooling.  The possible access to CP
violation in very long-baseline neutrino oscillations was the most
exciting prospect but it would be difficult to disentangle from
matter effects.  Nu physics is pushing the machine parameters to
very high intensities (10^22 mu decays per year) and energies
(50 GeV).  Neutrino experiments very close to the source were
also exciting.   Very compact, high resolution detectors would
have neutrino event rates (4.10^7 /kg/year) comparable with those
previously available in e and mu beams.

*** Isotropic neutrino beams; or at least 2 Dimensions
</h1>In 1990 I submitted an LOI for a neutrino beam from FNAL to
Soudan.  Fermilab was having similar discussions with
representatives from IMB, Grande and DUMAND.  Taiji Yamanouchi
accepted the LOI, shook his head, and said that maybe Fermilab
should just produce an isotropic neutrino beam.  That idea almost
makes sense now.  At the FNAL user's meeting, Chris Quigg
described a muon storage ring aimed at Super-K, AMANDA, KGF,
Alice Springs and Gran-Sasso.

*** Three dimensional Atmospheric Neutrino Flux Calculation
</h1>Previous calculations of the atmospheric neutrino flux have made
a 1-D approximation, i.e. secondaries and decay products are
collinear to the primary cosmic ray.  A new 3-D calculation (see
Battistoni et al, below) shows that the 1-D approximation gives
the wrong neutrino angular distribution for sub-GeV neutrinos.
However the angular smearing from measuring only the lepton is
large enough to wash out this difference, so there is no bias in
determining oscillation parameters in current experiments.  An
upcoming paper will address comparisons will balloon mu data.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrinos in extra dimensions
</h1>There is recent theoretical interest in the notion that extra
dimensions could be as large as 1 mm, but have escaped detection.
The true Planck scale would then be a few TeV, rather than 10^19
as it appears in our 4 dimensional world.   This would solve the
hierarchy problem.  If the right-handed neutrinos exist in these
extra dimensions, a Dirac neutrino mass of 10^-3 eV naturally
emerges.  For example see Smirnov

<p> </p><h1>
*** Tube switch
</h1>The last of the 1220 phototubes from LSND has been removed and
boxed up. The phototubes will be shipped to Fermilab in the
fall, tested in FY2000, and installed in FY2001. BooNE data
taking should begin by the end of 2001.

<p> </p><h1>
*** The jellyfish dip?
</h1>Tokyo power reduced 3 1.1 million KW reactors to .8 million KW
because a swarm of jellyfish blocked its pipes at the Kashiwazaki-
Kariwa nuclear plant.  If KamLAND was running (it isn't yet), it
would have seen this dip in neutrino production.

<p> </p><h1>
*** NuMI Deputy manager &amp; MINOS manager
</h1>The new deputy manager of the NuMI project at Fermilab is Greg
Bock, replacing Dixon Bogert who is now manager.  The new MINOS
project manager is Aesook Byon-Wagner.
