*** T2K sees first long-baseline event

This
long-baseline neutrino experiment using the new JPARC accelerator
and the Super-Kamiokande detector 295 km away is moving towards
higher beam intensity.  The press release reported the
first far detector event on 24 Feb 10.  Previously INGRID, the
on-axis near detector saw its first event on 22 Nov 09, and the
off-axis near detector also observed a neutrino  on 19 Dec 09.

*** Future neutrino experiments for theta-13
</h1> <p>
Good planning for future nu facilities requires a good evaluation
of the capabilities over time of upcoming experiments.  We rely on
theorists to compare sensitivity reach of future experiments.  A
notable recent effort is Patrick Huber et al. who compare the
reach of experiments in Figure 6 of
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.1896"> arXiv:0907.1896.  </a>
One problem
they have is to understand the schedule of experiments.  A common
but unsatisfactory solution is to believe the schedule given in
the proposal.  Experiments often fall behind their schedules
adiabatically, and are reluctant to regularly update them, so they
can be behind schedules they continue to show.

*** Reactor Neutrino delays;  Double Chooz, RENO, Daya Bay
</h1> <p>
Double Chooz, RENO and Daya Bay are all making progress towards
getting new information about theta-13, but are also all behind
the schedules shown in Huber's Figure 6.  Double Chooz installed
the cables to its phototubes which are all in place on the far
detector, but issues regarding liquid filling will take longer
than originally thought.  Daya Bay has done much of its extensive
civil construction, but some soft rock in the region of its far
lab have prevented them from finishing yet.  Many parts for
construction of the first detector are on site, but safety
concerns about fire protection are causing a fraction of the
collaboration to stop on-site work for now.  RENO completed
construction of tunnels, vetos and buffers at both near and far
sites. Acrylic gamma catchers and targets are built and under
installation. PMTs are about to be installed. They plan to fill
in June.  Despite delays, results from all three are coming!

*** Neutrino theorists can add to their vacations
</h1> <p>
Neutrino theorists can breathe easier and may have less work
since Fermilab announced that the "standard neutrino theory"
has been confirmed.

I am reminded of a riddle attributed to neutrino pioneer
and "God Particle" author Leon Lederman: Question-"Why can't
you get an appointment with a particle theorist on a
Wednesday?"  Answer-"It would ruin two long weekends."  Two
theorists not on vacation, E. Akhmedov &amp; A. Smirnov merit a
read in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.1903"> arXiv:0905.1903, </a>
"Paradoxes of Neutrino Oscillations".

*** Using Neutrinos to detect and predict earthquakes

During February, an earthquake hit Fermilab and woke people up but
did no damage.  An earthquake in Chile was devastating.  Could
neutrinos play a role?  Wang et al. look at "Earthquake Forecast
via Neutrino Tomography" in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.2866"> arXiv:1001.2866.  </a>
A prominent
accelerator physicist once told me, "My friends have plans;  my
enemies have schemes;  I use methods."  When authors
describe their own idea as a scheme, it doesn't bode well.

*** Hank Sobel wins Pontecorvo prize
</h1> <p>
Hank Sobel from UC Irvine is being awarded the 2010 Bruno
Pontecorvo Prize from the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research
(JINR), Dubna.  This award has been given annually since 1995 to
"a distinguished scientist for the most significant investigation
in particle physics".  Hank has worked on many notable neutrino
experiments, including Savannah River, IMB, CHOOZ, Super-K, K2K,
and T2K.

*** Tingjun Yang wins the APS Mitsuyoshi Tanaka Award
</h1> <p>
The full name is the APS Mitsuyoshi Tanaka Dissertation Award in
Experimental Particle Physics.  His thesis was "A study of Muon
Neutrino to Electron Neutrino Oscillations in the MINOS
Experiment", and his Ph.D. adviser was Stan Wojcicki.

Participation is by invitation only,
but all neutrino enthusiasts who want to come should request
an invitation from the secretariat.  The XXIV International
Conference on Neutrino Physics and Astrophysics will be held at
the Megaron Athens International Conference Center.

As always, the "Neutrino
Oscillation Workshop" has come up with an amazing graphic.  It
represents a mosaic (not a real mosaic of course, but an ink
drawing of A4 letter size). It is inspired by a famous floor
mosaic in the nearby Cathedral of Otranto.  Previous NOW
attendees have seen the real "Tree of life" mosaic in the
afternoon excursion to Otranto.  It's a fascinating medieval
artwork by a monk named Pantaleone representing a symbolic
summary of the culture and theology of his time.

*** MAP (Muon Accelerator Project) R&amp;D Proposal
</h1> <p>
Fermilab will host a national effort on Muon Accelerator R&amp;D.  The
Lab is working with the existing Neutrino Factory Collaboration to
form a new national Muon Accelerator Program (MAP).  MAP will
study those aspects of a mu collider that require new technologies
and will complete a Design Feasibility Study (DFS).  A proposal
for R&amp;D has just been submitted:
