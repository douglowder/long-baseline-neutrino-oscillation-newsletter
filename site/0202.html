<h1> *** Super-K Accident Update </h1>
They were planning to start draining the tank in February and 
this should only take a few weeks.  When the accident took place, 
the amount of energy released was 75 MegaJoules.  It registered
on a seismographs 15 km away.  An internal report on the accident 
is not yet available, but many calculations exist, e.g.

<h1> *** SNO Accident Update (Science Fiction)</h1>
Pick up the January 2002 ANALOG Science Fiction Magazine, and 
part 1 of a serial by Robert Sawyer starts with an accident at 
the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory.  They lose the heavy water.  
There's this Neanderthal Physicist in an alternate universe who 
makes a mistake with a quantum computer.  Of course it is 
neutrino physicists in our universe who are the real stars.

<h1> *** NuMI upgrade workshop May 2-4 at Fermilab</h1>
A workshop on new initiatives with the NuMI beams will be held at 
Fermilab.  Working groups are being organized by <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="156574677455737b74793b727a63">[email&#160;protected]</a>.  
Fermilab Director Mike Witherell points out 2 ideas that have
attracted considerable interest:  an experiment using the off-
axis beam to look for numu to nue and a high-statistics 
non-oscillation experiment in the Near Detector Hall.

<h1> *** Neutrino Mass less than 2.2 eV</h1>
Pravda reports recent result on tritium endpoint

<h1> *** Neutrino Mass 1.6 eV or so</h1>
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey is counting galaxies in clusters of 
galaxies and see too few.  Neutrinos would lower the cluster 
abundance, so they fit to neutrino mass, and get a few eV, with 
best fit around 1.6.  Omega-nu = 0.03 (Omega-matter ~ 0.3 today).

<h1> *** Neutrino Mass may not be .39 eV </h1>
The recent report on evidence for neutrinoless double beta decay 
is disputed by the 26 authors of a comment on that paper in
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0202018"> hep-ex/0202018.  </a>
They say that the extraction of the "signal" depends upon the 
choice of window and the absence of a flat background, among 
other problems pointed out in the paper.  Also

<h1> *** Neutrinos for the Public </h1>
"Neutrinos get under your skin" is the title of a Fermilab Public 
Lecture by Boris Kayser on Friday March 1, 2002.  "The universe 
is made of tiny particles" we find out from this chicken farmer.

<h1> *** Neutrinos for the entrepreneur </h1>
"Neutrinos for Fun and Profit" is a set of in-depth informal 
meetings held at Fermilab on Thursday afternoons covering a 
variety of topics.  Contact <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6a1a0b180b2a0c040b06440d051c">[email&#160;protected]</a> to get on email list.

<h1> *** CNGS review at CERN </h1>
The Civil construction of the Cern Neutrinos to the Gran Sasso is 
going quite well, according to a recent review.  Construction is 
done almost to the end of the decay tunnel.  The extraction 
tunnel from the SPS to be shared with LHC is filling with racks. 
Modest cost increases are causing scrutiny, though. The approved 
cost was 71 MSF but is now thought to be 79 MSF.  29MSF is 
committed.  There may be some other small cost additions as the 
designs of technical components are finished.  CERN will soon 
re-evaluate and rank all non-LHC projects, including OPERA 
(Oscillation Project with Emulsion-tRacking Apparatus).

<h1> *** Looking at the sun with 20/20/20 vision </h1>
Or if you look at the archive, it's 
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ex/202020"> hep-ex/202020 </a>
where Smy finds 
a unique oscillation Solution to the Solar Neutrino Problem by 
combining Super-K, Homestake, Gallex/GNO, Sage & SNO.  It's LMA.

<h1> *** We get letters </h1>
"To Whom it May Concern, I just read about neutrinos in an 
astronomy book  and I guess they are what I have been able to 
see falling since I was about 14.  They look like empty spherical 
bubbles.  Their edges are very thin and appear to be made of 
fuzzy light but they don't shine, just fall slowly.  The 
exception to this rule is in stormy or pre-rainy rainy weather 
when the lights I see are more compact and whirl and dance.  At 
these times they are solid - smaller than the bubbles but 
brighter.  Sincerely RB"
