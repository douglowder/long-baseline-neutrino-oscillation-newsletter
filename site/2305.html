*** Hyper-Kamiokande Excavation of gigantic cavern has begun
</h1> <p>
The main underground cavity in which the Hyper-Kamiokande detector
will be installed is 69 m diameter, 73 m tall cylinder with a
21 m high domed support. When complete, it will be the largest
artificial underground cavity in the world.   After excavation of
a 1.9 km access tunnel, digging the cavern began in Nov. 2022.
The Hyper-Kamiokande collaboration aims begin operations using the
J-PARC accelerator and beamline upgrades in 2027.

*** DUNE excavation is proceeding
</h1> <p>
Excavation is about 65% complete overall; the central utility
cavern has been fully excavated.  A DUNE coordination office has
been established at Fermilab, and is being led by Steve Brice.

*** Veniamin Sergeevich Berezinsky 1934-2023
</h1> <p>
The Russian physicist Veniamin Sergeevich Berezinsky, considered
one of the founders of astroparticle physics and neutrino
astronomy, passed away in April in L'Aquila Italy.

*** Stanley George Wojcicki, 1937-2023
</h1> <p>
We remember Stanford Professor Wojcicki as a force of nature, and
not a weak one.  He was the first spokesman of MINOS, which led to
the revitalization of neutrino physics at Fermilab.  In 2010, his
daughter Anne and her then-husband, Google co-founder Sergey Brin,
endowed a $2.5 million chair in experimental physics at Stanford
in Stan's name.

*** Petition to keep Fermilab open
</h1> <p>
For 50 years, Fermilab has been an open facility, welcoming to the
community and research scientists from around the world. That has
recently changed.  Access restrictions make FNAL one of the harder
places to visit and work.  As usual, it took the initiative of
some of the young members of our field to try to bring reason to
the decision makers.  A petition with &gt; 2500 signatories so far to
do just that can be found at
<a href="https://www.reopenfermilab.com/">

*** Explanation for Fermilab access restrictions
</h1> <p>
<a href="https://news.fnal.gov/2023/05/from-lia-merminga-accessing-fermilabs-batavia-site/">

</a>
Fermilab director Lia Merminga posted an open letter about FNAL
access on Ferminews.  While making openness a goal, the letter
implies the difficulties and inefficiencies in working at Fermilab
are needed for safety and security.  I was disappointed that the
letter didn't acknowledge that a heavy burden arising from new
restrictions is borne by the international physics community.
This is counter to the 2014 P5 advice to, "Reformulate the long-
baseline neutrino program as an internationally designed,
coordinated, and funded program with Fermilab as host."

</p><h1>
*** rant:  safety and security arguments
</h1> <p>
The wearing of badges doesn't provide security.  A fence around
Fermilab or the prevention of visitors coming on site doesn't keep
anyone away from already access-controlled areas.  Arguments about
safety &amp; security, when they are used as excuses rather than
reasons, diminish safety and security, and run counter to the
long-run interests of neutrino physics in the U.S. and the world.

*** Retired Neutrino Physicist on Mount Everest
</h1> <p>
<a href="https://www.telegraphindia.com/my-kolkata/news/the-telegraph-meets-a-senior-citizen-from-new-town-who-is-just-back-from-a-trek-to-the-everest-base-camp/cid/1941527">

</a>
Naba Mondal, 1st leader of the India-Based Neutrino Observatory,
made it up and back to the Everest Base Camp, 5364 m above sea
level.  It took 10 days and covered 130 km.  In his thesis a few
years back at the Kolar Gold Fields, he had measured atmospheric
neutrinos.  Does less atmosphere mean fewer neutrinos?

*** EPS award for 2023
</h1> <p>
The 2023 EPS High Energy and Particle Physics Prize is awarded to
Cecilia Jarlskog for the discovery of an invariant measure of CP
violation in both quark and lepton sectors; and to 2 of the 3
experiments which measured theta_13 using reactor neutrinos.
The latter led to the conclusion that the lepton invariant is much
larger than in the quark sector, and favored construction of the
new round of long-baseline experiments, DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande.

*** New record power for NuMI beam at Fermilab
</h1> <p>
A 22 May power record for the Main Injector is 960 kW, by reducing
the cycle time from 1.2 s to 1.13 s.  The goal is 1.065 s. But the
beam is down at the moment due to a water leak.  NOvA's total
expected beam by the 9 July shutdown is 3.75e20, below the base
goal of 4.5 e20. NOvA will end at the LBNF long shutdown in late
2026.  It hopes to have 60e20 pot by then.
