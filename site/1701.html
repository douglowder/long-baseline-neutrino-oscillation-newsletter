*** Fermi's mistake?
</H1> <P>
In its article on "Why are we called Fermilab", you can see the
famous Fermi picture with the wrong formula for the fine structure
constant.

My adviser, who worked for Fermi at the time, said UChicago wanted
some publicity shots, and Fermi's office was too dark, so they
moved to the conference room, where someone had written equations
on the blackboard.  When the post office issued a stamp for Fermi,
Al Wattenberg checked it for "mistakes".  As a result, part of the
wrong formula was cropped out.  But in the stamp ceremony, Nina
Byers  claimed this was clearly Fermi's handwriting.

*** LBNF anomaly and ITER
</H1> <P>
Nobody knows what Congress is going to do, but with the change of
administration and the current Continuing Resolution, it is
reasonable to speculate that there will be a CR all year.  In that
case, in order to start construction, LBNF needs an "anomaly",
which has been advocated by congressmen from S. Dakota, Illinois
and others.  But other big projects in the Office of Science may
be correlated.  For example, in a May 2016 Report on the Continued
U.S. Participation in the ITER Project, find, "The DOE Office of
Science is considering several other projects of $1B or more,
including Exascale computing, LBNF/DUNE, PIP, APS Upgrade and SNS
2nd target Station.  Absent additional resources being made
available, DOE would need to delay some of the projects listed
above...but DOE is committed to funding the resources needed for
ITER in the budgets through FY2018."

*** U.S. Congress has a sense for neutrino research
</H1> <P>

"The Director shall carry out research activities on rare decay
processes and the nature of the neutrino, which may include
collaborations with the National Science Foundation or
international collaborations." This was part of the "DOE Research
and Innovation Act" passed by the House (not yet law).  The
sponsor and science chair Lamar Smith said: "The committee will
continue to prioritize basic research at the Department of Energy,
and will work to limit spending on late-stage commercialization
programs that distort the energy market. Critical reforms are
needed to ensure the Department of Energy spends limited federal
research dollars on discovery science that the private sector
cannot conduct, not loan guarantees and subsidies."

*** Heritage Foundation report on the DOE
</H1> <P>
The Heritage Foundation is a think tank with a point of view
favored by some republicans.  They've suggested a DOE budget:

It proposed many cuts.  I couldn't find cuts for HEP, but in the
section proposing to reduce nuclear physics spending, it wrote:
"Much like the High Energy Physics program, funding for the
Nuclear Physics program has become unaffordable."

<H1>
*** NOvA oscillation values
</H1> <P>
NOvA's publication preprint on muon neutrino disappearance covers
the data shown at Neutrino 2016.  
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.5891"> arXiv:1701.5891 </A>
For the Normal
ordering, delta msquared_32=(2.76 +- 0.11) e-3 eV^2 with two best
fit values of sin^2(theta_23) = 0.404 +0.030 -0.022 and 0.624+0.022
-0.030 at 68%CL, disfavoring maximal mixing with 2.6 sigma.

*** Do Something For Science
</H1> <P>
This is a new section of the newsletter.  Every scientist should
"do something for science" daily.  I will welcome suggestions how
we can promote science and pass them along.  The 1st suggestion is
to volunteer for the Fermilab "Ask a Scientist" program.

*** NEOS - NEutrino Oscillation at Short Baseline
</H1> <P>
This is a very short-baseline reactor neutrino experiment in
Korea designed to look for oscillations arising from a sterile
neutrino explanation of the reactor neutrino anomaly.  Their
results so far don't find any.

*** Sterile Neutrinos, Fact or Fiction?
</H1> <P>
At the Washington APS meeting, Patrick Huber reviewed data
concerning sterile neutrinos with this title.  He concludes that
disregarding the MiniBooNE low energy excess, an eV-scale sterile
nu is a simple explanation for all observations.

*** More on the APS April meeting and semantics
</H1> <P>
The APS meeting used to be called the Washington meeting, but it
was in April and got expensive due in part to Cherry Blossoms.  So
it was moved to other cities, and later named the April meeting,
though it was sometimes in May.  This year the April meeting was
in January in Washington.  They told participants to use 16x9
"widescreen" slides, and not 4x3 "standard" slides, because
"widescreen" is now standard and "standard" is non-standard.
