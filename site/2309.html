*** Physics Graduate wins Nobel Peace Prize

Narges Mohammadi won the
2023 Nobel Peace Prize for her fight against the oppression of
women and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all.
She had been the winner of the 2018 Sakharov award from the
American Physical Society.  This July, the APS Committee on
International Freedom of Scientists drafted a letter which the APS
Board sent to leaders and judges in Iran, urging the release of
Mrs. Mohammadi who is serving a 10 year sentence for criticizing
the Iranian judicial system's treatment of minorities.

*** Next Supernova seminar series on 17 October
</H1> <P>
A SNEWS Supernova Seminar Series has been established that ranges
from theory to experiment and from modeling to observation; it
covers neutrinos, gravitational waves, the electromagnetic
spectrum and, of course, multi-messenger efforts.

*** PRL Journal Club on FASER Collider Neutrinos
</H1> <P>
FASER is a forward detector near the ATLAS experiment at the LHC
and was featured at an online and recorded session, which may be
found at 
<A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t67u-YoE3nk">

They see
153 +- 2 (bkg) candidate neutrino events from the ATLAS
interaction region, from an estimated 10^11 neutrinos which
passed through the detector.  They also tagged 64 million muons
coming from the interaction region.  These are the first
interactions from neutrinos produced at a collider.

*** Can a Neutrino interact with a photon?

Neutrinos might have magnetic moments.  I think this is saying
something different from that, but I am not sure.

<H1>
*** Antineutrinos fall in a gravitational field
</H1> <P>

</A>
This is as
expected, but how to test it has been long discussed.  The ALPHA
experiment at CERN concluded that antimatter, or at least anti-
Hydrogen, falls in a gravitational field the same way as matter.
I wonder if anyone has ever had a theory with the opposite
conclusion, and if so, what it says about Majorana neutrinos.

<H1>
*** CERN continues to support the Fermilab-hosted DUNE experiment
</H1> <P>

</A>
On 11 Sep 2023, FNAL and CERN signed a project planning document
to advance DUNE.  Excavation of the large caverns of the Long-
Baseline Neutrino Facility that will house the cryogenic vessels,
detector modules and related infrastructure a mile underground in
South Dakota is nearly 80% complete.

<H1>
*** Reduced running for NOvA in 2023
</H1> <P>

There is a new DOE directive regarding the safety of accelerator
operations.  The Fermilab accelerators will not be allowed to
restart until each system is in compliance with this directive.
Beam may not return to the Main Injector until late February 2024.

</H1> <P>
<A href="https://indico.ihep.ac.cn/event/20514/">

NPB2024, for which an
invitation is required, will discuss the origin of nu masses, the
nature of dark matter, and the source of matter-antimatter
asymmetry in the Universe.  It will be 19-21 February 2024, on the
HKUST campus in Hong Kong, China.  An exclusive visit to JUNO—
slated for completion early next year—will be arranged.

Like a good
politician, the answer doesn't contain the answer to the question.

*** P5 report to be discussed at December HEPAP meeting
</H1> <P>
The presentation of the report of the Particle Physics Project
Prioritization Panel (P5), a HEPAP subpanel, will take place at a
HEPAP meeting 7-8 Dec. 2023.  A hybrid P5 report town hall will be
held at FNAL on 11 Dec. in the afternoon.  HEPAP meetings are open
to the public.
