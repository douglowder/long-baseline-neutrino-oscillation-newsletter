*** Neutrino 2022 to be virtual again in May/June 2022
</h1> <p>
“The XXX International Conference on Neutrino Physics and
Astrophysics” will be held 30 May - 4 June in virtual Seoul Korea.
It is the 50th Anniversary of this meeting.  Many new interesting
results will be reported either in the plenary or poster sessions.
Due to COVID-19, the participants will be scattered throughout the
world, but our spirits will be united by our interests in neutrino
and astrophysics.

*** Poster deadline for Neutrino 2022
</h1> <p>
Registration for Neutrino 2022 opens 1 March.  But the poster
abstract submission is open and the deadline is 28 Feb 2022. The
currently announced deadline for submitting posters is 18 April,
more than a month before the meeting.  This isn't the best plan
for the most up-to-date results which will be presented in oral
sessions to be supported by detailed poster presentations.

*** If 5 sigma is good, is 21 sigma better?
</h1> <p>
In
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11375"> arXiv:2112.11375 </a>,
an association was found between fast radio
bursts and Ice-Cube neutrino events at a quoted significance
level of 21 sigma.  An independent analysis in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13820"> arXiv:2112.13820 </a>
finds
no signal.  The first paper was withdrawn from the arXiv.

*** T2K (from the J-PARC newsletter)
</h1> <p>
The J-PARC neutrino facility and T2K continue to work on upgrades
of the beamline and near detectors.  There is progress but there
are also challenges due to COVID.  These were discussed during the
T2K collaboration meeting, which was 24 Nov - 15 Dec.  Mechanical
fabrication is going well but there were delays on the delivery of
electronics. Some travel bans are a critical issue for J-PARC
assembly work. In addition to oscillation analysis, joint analysis
of T2K beam data and SK atmospheric data, and T2K-NOvA joint
analysis challenges were also discussed.

*** Neutrino Wordle, not what Josh Wardle had in mind
</h1> <p>
What is the connection between neutrinos and wordle?  As you guess
words and rule in or out letters and their positions in an unknown
word, the wavefunction collapses.  There is a neutrino oscillation
analogy there.   Here are some words to try:  Dirac, anode, MINOS,
NOMAD, BooNE, argon, steel, water, noble, Nobel, solar, wires,
super, hyper, OPERA, CHOOZ, SNEWS, CUORE, GERDA. T2HKK is probably
not allowed.

*** rant:  email messages without dates and other information
</h1> <p>
Since I don't read every email the day it is sent, an email with
the subjects "Meeting tomorrow" or "Today's meeting canceled" may
be confusing.  Also since most of us attend many meetings,
a bit more specificity in the subject would often be helpful.
Last week, Argonne sent a message that the lab was closed due to
weather, and "Argonne" appeared nowhere in the from: or message.

*** Snowmass Neutrino Meeting will be a hybrid meeting.

The neutrino frontier workshop will be 16-18 March at Oak Ridge.

*** Snowmass neutrino white papers so far
</h1> <p>
I'm not confident that it is up to date, but there are only 3
neutrino white papers at
<a href="https://snowmass21.org/submissions/nf">
https://snowmass21.org/submissions/nf.
</a>
There are also 24 "anticipated" neutrino white papers at
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ORQe5LYSaLQ7rsg7UihlD485cUDAxWlb9qZsOlgutIs/edit#gid=0">
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ORQe5LYSaLQ7rsg7UihlD485cUDAxWlb9qZsOlgutIs/edit#gid=0
</a>
but I anticipate there will be more.

"Prospects for keV Sterile Neutrino Searches with
KATRIN",   A promising way to search for keV-scale sterile nus is
via high-precision beta spectroscopy, where these particles
manifest themselves as tiny distortion of the spectral shape.
KATRIN has the potential to surpass the sensitivity of previous
laboratory-based searches.

"Nu Physics with Noble Liquid Bubble Chambers",
The Scintillating Bubble Chamber collaboration is developing
scintillating liquid noble bubble chambers for dark matter and
CEvNS physics. The nuclear recoil energy threshold goal is 100 eV,
so CEνNS Enu threshold could be as low as 1.4 MeV.  Physics goals
include searches for new physics such as dark matter candidates
with reactor, solar, supernova &amp; pre-supernova neutrinos.
There is a potential applications involving reactor monitoring.

"Search for Heavy Sterile Neutrinos Using 39Ar Beta
Decays in Large LArTPC Detectors"  A study of 39Ar beta decays in
DUNE allows for a search for sterile neutrinos in the 20-450 keV
mass range, leading to a significantly better global sensitivity
in that range.  To make use of the full expected O[10^(19)] decays
further development of the DUNE far detector DAQ may be necessary.

"Nuclear Recoil Calibration Techniques for Dark
Matter and Neutrino Experiments",  Neutron sources are needed that
can deliver neutrons with kinetic energies in the range of 1 keV
to 14 MeV, both for dedicated nuclear recoil efficiency studies
and for calibrations in situ of large detectors.  The suitability
of a variety of neutron calibration techniques are considered.

"LANSCE-PSR Short-Pulse Upgrade for Improved
Dark Matter and Sterile Neutrino Searches"  This LOI discusses how
accelerator upgrades at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center can
lead to improved searches for sterile neutrinos using the Coherent
CAPTAIN Mills 10-10 liquid argon detector.
