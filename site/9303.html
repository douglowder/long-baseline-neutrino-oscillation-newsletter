</p><h1>First 822 collaboration meeting set April 21</h1>
An agenda for the first 822 collaboration meeting at
Argonne on April 21st has been sent out.  (It's
available on anlhep::_$dra3:[mcg]agenda.txt.
Please notify Maury Goodman if you are coming and he
doesn't already know it, so that gate passes can be
arranged.

<h1> Main Injector groundbreaking</h1>
March 22nd, the Main Injector groundbreaking took place,
for construction at MI60.  Previous work had taken place
on wetland mitigation.  A number of politicians and
scientists were there.   In a session after the
groundbreaking by the Director John Peoples, neutrinos
to Minnesota was mentioned prominently in answer to a
question about Fermilab's long term future.

<h1>Beam work progressing, Fluor Daniel starting work</h1>
Meanwhile Gordon Koizumi and others from the Main
Injector group have made substantial progress in
planning the beam and extraction to Minnesota.  A wall
sized display of the beam is now at Argonne.  And in a
full day meeting, Gordon and others worked with the new
consulting engineers (Fluor Daniel) to bring them up to speed
on some of the beam design issues.  First reactions were
that the beam might be built with mining techniques rather
than drilling (??) and that the experimental buildings,
which nominally sit on top of shale below the dolomite,
can be adequately supported by the shale.

<h1>Main Injector Intensity up</h1>
P822 was written based on a main injector intensity of
4 10**13 every 2 seconds.   Now much higher intensities
are being foreseen, and 10**14 every 1.5 seconds has been
mentioned as the design intensity.

<h1>Nuclear Physics Workshop</h1>
A nuclear physics workshop on neutrino physics has been
organized for October 20th in conjunction with the
Division of Nuclear Physics Meeting the 21st to 23rd at
Asilomar in Pacific Grove California (Monterey).  It is
being organized by Kevin Lesko at Berkeley 510-486-7844.
Topics include solar, atmospheric, accelerator, reactor
and supernova neutrinos.

<h1>Shootout LBL versus P822</h1>
At the Argonne DOE review, the Soudan atmospheric
neutrino results and the possibility of P822 were well
received, including a comparison of 822 to the approved
possible Brookhaven long baseline experiment.  One of
the DOE officials mentioned the possibility of a
committee (HEPAP subpanel perhaps?) comparing the
Brookhaven and Fermilab experiments.

<h1>New Scientist Report</h1>
The new Scientist reported the atmospheric neutrino
problem and the "intriguing" long baseline proposal on
page 16 of the March 13, 1993 article.  The author was
Christine Sutton who just came out with a book,
"Spaceship Neutrino".

<h1>Venice Neutrino telescopes meeting</h1>
Peter Litchfield reports from the Venice meeting on
neutrino telescopes, there was a theory talk by Vogel who
couldn't change the mu-mu to nu-e ratio by nuclear
effects by more than 5%, a review by Suzuki of the
Kamioka data showing a large number of consistency check
that they have done on their data, presentations by
Icarus that a 3.5 kiloton detector had been chosen as
their first step, and Frejus stands by their ratio of
1.01 and not the .83 for contained events alone.  A side
trip to Gran Sasso included enormous empty halls there.

Solar Puzzle", Richard Milburn, TUHEP-93-01.  Could this
be right?  Could we have been so blind?  Spin rotation
from Thomas precession could be changing 50% of neutrinos into
sterile right handed neutrinos.  This sounds wrong, but
I don't know why.
