*** Intel scholarship winner studies neutrinos
</h1>Natalia Toro, a 14-year old high school senior from Boulder,
Colo. won the Intel Science Talent Search (formerly Westinghouse)
with a project on neutrinos.  Her project was "Independent
Analysis of Evidence for numu -&gt; nutau Oscillations in the
Super-Kamiokande Atmospheric Neutrino Data."  She wins a college
scholarship of $50,000 and hopes to attend MIT.   She started nu
research with the Research Science Institute at MIT summer '98.

*** Monica bad for neutrinos in UK
</h1>Work on MINOS in Oxford was interrupted on 11th March by
unprecedented crowds in the centre of town caused by the presence
of Monica Lewinsky autographing copies of her book at a local
bookshop.  But prospects for full funding of the MINOS effort in
the UK by PPARC look pretty good.  A PPESP presentation went well
on 29th March, and PPARC decides this summer.  UK responsibilities
in MINOS include the rear-end electronics and the near detector.

*** New atmospheric oscillation signature at Super-K
</h1>Super-K quotes its R value from 3200 sub-GeV single ring events
and 700 multi-GeV single ring events.  There are also 2000
multi-ring events.  In the two ring event sample, "2-e" events
(with no pizero) are 59% nue-CC; "2-mu" &amp; "1e-1mu" events are
89% numu-CC.  With just these events, they see a numu deficit,
and a zenith angle effect with a consistent value of delta-m^2.
The pizero/e Ratio (NC/CC) is 1.11 +- 0.06(stat)+-0.02(MC)+-
0.26(syst) where the systematic error is dominated by cross
section uncertainty.   This ratio would be 1.00 for numu to
nutau, and R(~.67) for numu to sterile neutrinos.

*** Transient neutrino flux?
</h1>One feature of the new 201 days of data from Super-K compared
to their PRL is 5 or 6 standard deviations away from the
earlier data.  The overall event rate has dropped by about
12% and the electron rate has dropped by about 4 sigma.  The
measured mu/e rate in the new 201 days is 6 sigma higher.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Palo Verde
</h1>First results from the Palo Verde reactor neutrino oscillation
experiment were presented at WEIN.  With 70 days data, they
measure an energy distribution as expected without numu to nue
oscillations, and set limits on the mixing of .6 at high mass and
1.5 10^-3 eV^2 at maximal mixing.  Signal:Background is 2:1.

<p> </p><h1>
*** SNO full
</h1>The Sudbury Solar Neutrino Experiment is now full and trigger
studies show that at 30 hits, the detector is comfortable at
700Hz.  Backgrounds due to U are below design goals, Th in H20 is
at the goal, and a few times high in the D20.  Some phototube
bases have leaked water at a connector, 15% so far, or 4% of the
total have some degree of breakdown.  That's being monitored.
Neutrino data will start in about 2 months, after Rn decays.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrinos for the next thousand years
</h1>The NNN conference (Nucleon Decay, Neutrino Oscillations and
Neutrino Astrophysics) will consider design of a much larger
water detector than Super-Kamiokande.  It will be held at
Stonybrook from September 23-25th.  Details will be at
www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/numeetings.html when I get them.
There is a recent link to the meeting on Neutrinos for the Next
Millenium, June 10-12 at Hopkins, a workshop to assess recent
progress in neutrino physics.  www.pha.jhu.edu/events/jhwsh99

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrino Security at Los Alamos
</h1>There have been reports in the popular press that some neutrinos
from Los Alamos National Laboratory are missing.  Officials are
quick to point out that unlike the shortages of neutrinos in
Japan, Gran Sasso, Homestake, Baksan and Soudan, Los Alamos
actually has extra neutrino events.  Nevertheless, security
officials are busy with plans to surround Los Alamos with
light years of lead.

<p> </p><h1>
*** MiniBooNe
</h1>MiniBooNe is in the process of preparing a technical design
report.  They have a Director's review in April.
