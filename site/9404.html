</p><h1>PAC presentation for P822</h1>
On March 8th, Peter Litchfield presented recent work done on the
Fermilab Long Baseline proposal, concentrating on systematic
effects on the neutral current to charged current ratio, and
energy measurements.  We also showed the tau to e nu nu
quasielastic signature for which we expect 8 events with a
background of 3 at the "Kamioka point", and the neutral current
energy distribution, modified by the appearance of tau events,
which is a 5 sigma effect for maximal mixing.

</p><h1>PAC response</h1>
The PAC wrote, "The Committee is very pleased by the recent
progress of P822...The Committee strongly encourages the group
to continue exploring the limiting systematics using the present
Soudan detector data and Monte Carlo calculations" and
encouraged us to develop an EOI for "a staged approach to a
larger detector, with increased statistical reach and
well-studied systematics.  From their present progress we have a
good indication that a compelling experiment may be possible."
EOI's are due May 16th.

</p><h1>Deputy Spokesmen for 822</h1>
<a href="/soudan2/people/heller-k.html">Ken Heller</a>
from the University of Minnesota and
<a href="/soudan2/people/litchfield-pj.html">Peter Litchfield</a>
from Rutherford Appleton Laboratory have been designated as Deputy
Spokesmen for Proposal 822

</p><h1>No "Standard" solution to Solar neutrino problem</h1>
Fifteen authors (see below) have criticized a paper by Dar and
Shaviv, which had claimed to "explain" the solar neutrino problem
with a differently extrapolated nuclear cross section for Be7.
That solution ignores not only some of the solar neutrino
data, but also most of the measured nuclear cross sections for
Be7.   Further, if other modelers run (5) other solar neutrino
codes with the parameters of the Dar and Shaviv model, they
still get substantial disagreement (4-6 sigma) with the
Gallex, Sage and Kamioka data, as well as irreconcilable
differences with the Homestake data.
<p>
</p><h1>Interesting data from LSND</h1>
LSND has preliminary results from 6 weeks of data taking.  This
includes a measurement of numu Carbon to mu- N at 100 MeV.
They get a shape which agrees with expectation, but a
normalization of .47 +- .19 of what is expected based on a Fermi
Gas Model.  Could this be relevant to atmospheric nus?  Maybe,
but its on the low energy side, and most explanations would give
nue's low as well.
Also of interest is 8 events with a background of 1 in numubar
to nuebar oscillation region, E &gt; 38eV.  If interpreted as
oscillations, P ~ .01 and delta m**2 is about 1 eV**22.
<p>
</p><h1>CHORUS has started taking data.</h1>
NOMAD will start in 1995.
<p>
</p><h1>Are neutrinos tachyons?</h1>
Tritium endpoints:
New Livermore data gives m**2 = -120 +- 20 +- 15
previous data       Mainz      - 39 +- 34 +- 15
Zurich     - 24 +- 48 +- 61
Los Alamos -147 +- 68 +- 41
and Tokyo too.  Does anyone know if tachyonic nus oscillate?

</p><h1>DOE review of Brookhaven</h1>
During a long baseline (E889) presentation at Brookhaven, Hess
and O'Fallon were discouraging about the prospects of getting
funding in the short term (2 years), or even getting a review.
<p>
</p><h1>CERN long baseline working group</h1>
At a meeting on April 26th at Gran Sasso, proponents of CERN
long baseline projects to ICARUS, GENIUS, and NESTOR compared
notes, as did representatives of 822.   Event rate estimates are
350 events per kiloton-year at 450 GeV; 210 at 160 GeV, based on
1(450) to 3(160) x 10**19 protons on target.   The ICARUS
proposal was optimistic by about 5.   The reason for the lack of
a near station appears to be the beam tunnel finishes directly
under Meyrin.  Preliminary estimates for the cost of the
neutrino beam, without near station, were 50MSwFr.
<p>
</p><h1>DPF neutrino subgroup meets</h1>
May 1st-2nd about 30 physicists working on a diverse group of
neutrino mass experiments met to plan the DPF study group
document.  There will be some follow up at Johns Hopkins next
week.  Those wishing to help should contact fnalv::rameika
<p>
</p><h1>822 Coding Standards</h1>
The Soudan group is rewriting its "coding standards" and
specification of platforms for group fortran code.  This
will be the logical starting place for 822 code.  If you have
opinions about these issues, contact Nick West at 20046::west.
