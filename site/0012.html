*** Tau neutrino is the particle of the year
</h1>Two years ago, this newsletter declared the neutrino to be the
particle of the year.  In retrospect, we should have specified
the eigenstate nu_3.  This year the DONUT result that charged
current interactions of the tau neutrino have been observed
impels us to honor a different eigenstate, nu_tau.

*** Comparing Ue3^2 with numu to nue
</h1>One goal of the long-baseline experiments is to measure or limit
numu to nue coupling at/near the Super-K value of dmsq.  An
existing limit from CHOOZ already exists.   One point about
presentation of these limits is not universally known.  CHOOZ
limits are usually shown in a two-neutrino plot, dmsq versus
sin^2 2-theta_12.  Let's imagine that plotted this way, a
long-baseline experiment does twice as well after a given amount
of running.  If you then plot the same two results versus
Ue3^2, they are the same.  The long-baseline appearance
experiment must include another factor of sin^2 theta_23 ~ 1/2.

*** Mass of the wrong neutrino in tau decays
</h1>At e+e- machines, one physics topic was to look at tau decays and
use the kinematics of multi-pion decays to limit the "tau
neutrino" mass.  But this was usually done by taking the single
event closest to the kinematic limit to constrain the mass, (a
few tens of MeV).   We now think that nu_tau is an approximately
equal mix of nu_2 and nu_3.  But for ANY mix, this procedure sets
an upper limit only on the LIGHTER of the two mass eigenstates.

*** UNO will be called UNO
</h1>At its collaboration meeting in December at WIPP, UNO decided
that it will be called UNO, Underground Nucleon decay and
neutrino Observatory.  WIPP is enthusiastic about the project,
and excavation costs are being understood.  Water handling issues
are the next major study topic.  Losing candidates for names
included ARMAGEDDON (A Really Massive and Gigantic Experiment
Detecting Decay of Nucleons), DIAMOND (Detector In A Mine
Observing Nucleon Decays), PLUNGE (Proton Lifetime Underground
Next Generation Experiment), and THUNDER (The Huge Underground
Nucleon Decay Experimental Rig).

*** JAERI-KEK Project approved
</h1>Phase 1 of the JAERI-KEK Joint Project on high-intensity proton
accelerators was approved for construction.  Although the formal
approval of the budget will be made by the Diet next year,
the notice from the Japanese Government means that Phase 1 was
practically approved: 1) 400 MeV Linac (normal conducting),
2) 3 GeV Proton Synchrotron (PS) at 1 MW, 3) 50 GeV PS at 0.75 MW,
4) major part of the 3 GeV neutron/meson facility, and 5) a
portion of the 50 GeV experimental facility.  The Phase 1 budget
is 1,335 Oku Yen.  Completion is planned in 6 years.  (1 Oku Yen
~ $1 million)  The cost including Phase 2 is 1,890 Oku Yen.

*** Neutrino Focusing
</h1>D. Monderen considers astrophysical situations which focus
neutrinos in

Beam designers will have to settle
for horns, lithium lenses and hadronic hoses.

*** New Energy Secretary neutrino-neutral
</h1>Spencer Abraham, the designated new secretary of energy, once
sponsored a bill to eliminate the energy department.  But he is
not the Michigan congressman who during a debate on funding the
national weather service in the commerce department said, "We
don't need the government; I get my weather from The Weather
Channel."

*** Nuclear neutrino physicists meet, recommend
</h1>A group of 104 neutrino physics met and made a set of
recommendations:  #1 move new solar/supernova/beta-beta
experiments through R&amp;D Quickly and spearhead an effort to create
a deep underground multipurpose lab; #2 support a neutrino bunker
at the SNS beam stop, and #3, theory/computational initiative on
supernova mechanism, and #4, support collaborators on projects
funded primarily by others.
