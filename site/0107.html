<h1>Long-Baseline news,  July 2001 </h1>

<p> <h1>
*** Neutrino consensus for US High Energy Physics
</h1>Many drafts of a "consensus" of the US HEP community circulated 
at Snowmass.  Early drafts did not even include the word 
neutrino, but the final statement listed "the elucidation of 
neutrino masses and mixing" as one of 6 outstanding issues to be 
addressed by HEP.  Strong support for the existing neutrino 
program was also mentioned, but endorsing a linear collider will 
be the most quoted conclusion.  The neutrino subgroup indicated 
support for a neutrino superbeam the #1 priority.

*** Neutrino awareness in Utah
</h1>While at Arches Utah, I wore a "Cosmic Ray Conference" shirt, 
while my daughter had on a "Soudan, proton decay" t-shirt.  One
day we were asked "What are cosmic rays?" The next, "What does 
proton decay mean?"  As we started to explain, we were asked each 
time, "Does that have something to do with neutrino mass?"
 
<p> <h1>
*** LANNDD
</h1>A massive Liquid Argon Detector for Proton Decay, Supernova and 
Solar Neutrino Studies and a Neutrino Factory Detector.  If 
future large nucleon decay detectors are background limited, it 
might take a fine-grained detector to discover nucleon decay.  
This idea (from Cline, Learned and McDonald) is for a 70 kT 
active volume liquid argon TPC immersed in a magnetic field.

It could go in Carlsbad.

*** 335 sign neutrino letter of intent
</h1>A letter of intent for neutrino experiments beyond MINOS and 
Mini-Boone has attracted 335 signatories.  It can be found at

*** Soudan 2 turned off
</h1>This nucleon decay and atmospheric nu detector began data taking 
in `89; reached 5.90 kt-years when turned off this month.

<p> <h1>
*** Fermilab Hadron Hose dropped
</h1>Another casualty of NuMI funding priorities is the hadronic hose, 
a wire down the beam pipe which would have increased the low 
energy flux and decreased near/far systematic effects. 

<p> <h1>
*** Tunnel Boring Machine wet, then dry
</h1>A pump failed and the tunnel boring machine digging the NuMI 
tunnel got wet.  But it dried out quickly and is boring again.
Meanwhile, the first MINOS plane is installed.  See

<p> <h1>
*** KamLAND filling
</h1>KamLAND, a reactor neutrino experiment in Japan which is expected 
to confirm the Large Mixing Angle solar neutrino (LMA) solution 
is about half full of scintillator.  They hope to be running in 
October and present results at the Sendai Conference 02/02.

<p> <h1>
*** Super-Kamiokande unfilling
</h1>At the end of July, the K2K run ended and Super-Kamiokande 
started draining the tank in order to replace a few inner and a 
few more out phototubes.  They will be able to run in super-nova 
mode at night with most water levels.   The process of draining 
fixing and filling will take about six months.

<p> <h1>
*** Novel nu-e beam idea
</h1>Helium 6 has a lifetime of 0.8 seconds.  Zucchelli suggests a
relativistic beam of Helium 6 to make a pure nu-e beam with 
a perfectly known energy spectrum.  See 
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0107006"> hep-ex/0107006 </a>.


<p> <h1>
*** House funds ICE Cube, Senate Homestake
</h1>The Committee has included $15M to initiate the IceCube Neutrino 
Detector physics/astronomy project recently approved by the 
National Science Board. This project, building on the successful 
AMANDA demonstration, is designed to more fully develop knowledge 
of the origins of the universe as well as the fundamental nature 
of physical matter using its unique polar telescope. A house 
committee also recommended 11.4M for NuMI, the same as the budget 
request.  The senate "encourages" Ice-Cube but earmarks $10M for 
Homestake, "a world-class underground laboratory for physics, 
geology and extreme biology."  No extreme physics?

<p> <h1>
*** Will a Brighter Booster Help Fermilab Neutrino Experiments?
</h1>
Yes.  MINOS needs it to achieve originally projected nu rates.

<p> <h1>
*** Small Mixing Angle Solution Ruled out by SNO plus Super-K
</h1>It depends who you talk to, but interpretations of SNO are 
filling the preprint server.

*** Neutrino poetry in Nature, 7/12/1
</h1>Neutrinos have mass we've just found out.  They're not ghosts 
like we thought.   I see them as dragonflies...  (Jo Walton)
