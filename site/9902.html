*** K2K beam to target
</h1>On Feb.3 16:00(JST), the proton beam was successfully
extracted from the PS with newly installed fast extraction
system and was transported along the entire beam line to the
neutrino target point.  The PS group and beam channel group
did hard and excellent work.

*** LENS targets low energy solar neutrinos
</h1>If detecting neutrinos is considered hard, then detecting low
energy  (down to 250 keV) solar neutrinos, from the pp reaction,
seems almost impossible. The LENS (Low Energy Neutrino
Spectroscopy) Collaboration proposes to detect these low energy
solar nus.  The plan is to detect neutrino capture in which the
result is a prompt electron and an excited isomeric state which
then emits a photon. The trigger will be the electron with a
delayed gamma. The possible target elements are Yb, Se or Gd.

*** NuMI Critical Decision 2
</h1>In an important milestone of the NuMI/MINOS project, Martha Krebs,
Director of the DOE Office of Science, approved the NuMI Project
Execution Plan on Feb. 17.  This constitutes Critical Decision 2,
Approval of Baseline, and marks the transition to the execution
phase of the project.  To follow the critical decision process
(formally called key decision), see the

*** And God created the earth and the sun
</h1>Found on the
<a href="http://almime.mi.infn.it/">
Borexino home page:  </a> "As Everybody knows, the earth
and the sun were created for the sake of nu-oscillation
experiments. The distance between them was chosen as vacuum
oscillation length, the density inside the sun to fit the MSW
effect and the sun was prepared as an ideal pure electron nu
source.  When all this was done, there were created Bruno
Pontecorvo to invent idea of neutrino oscillations, John Bahcall
to calculate the solar neutrino flux, Ray Davis to perform the
first solar nu experiment and all the other solar-neutrino people
to accomplish this difficult job."   And of course the radius of
the earth was chosen for the atmospheric neutrino effect, and the
state of Wisconsin to be a neutrino drift space.

*** Majorana neutrino mass limit .2 eV
</h1>With 24 kg-yr of data, the Heidelberg Moscow neutrinoless double
beta decay experiment sets a lower limit on the half life in 76Ge
of 5.7 10^25 yr (90%CL), excluding an effective Majorana neutrino
mass greater than .2 eV.  This sets strong constraints on
degenerate neutrino mass models.  See
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-ex/9902014"> Baudis et al.</a>

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrino Dark Matter
</h1>The first two (<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-ph/9902219">
1</a>, <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-ph/9902271">
2,</a>)
papers listed below explore the neutrino
experiment/astrophysics interface.  Neutrino mass implied by
atmospheric and solar neutrino experiments is not thought to be
cosmologically significant, but adding LSND implies both a 4th
neutrino and cosmological consequences.

<p> </p><h1>
*** High Mixing angle MSW solution and atmospheric neutrinos
</h1>If the solution of the solar neutrino problem is due to the high
mixing angle MSW solution, numu to nue oscillations can affect
the observation of low energy atmospheric nu_e neutrinos.  The
last two papers below
(<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-ph/9902312">1</a>,
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-ph/9902261"> 2</a>)
seem to reach opposite conclusions on
whether Super-K data agree with or rule out this possibility.

http://www.snafu.de/~bigbang/poll.html </a>
where you can Enter your preferred values for
the Hubble constant, H0, the cosmic density parameter, Omega, and
the cosmological constant, Lambda.   What if Omega=10 wins?
