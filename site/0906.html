*** SNO done, and SNO+ getting ready
</H1> <P>
The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory used its heavy water to measure
(with a combined fit) theta-12 (34.4 +- 1.3 degrees) and Delta m^2 
(7.59 e-5+-0.2 eV^2).

It didn't want to lose any 
D20 and it didn't lose any.  I has given it all back to the AECL 
and it gave it back cleaner.  But they kept everything else 
(acrylic, tubes, ...)   Next a new collaboration will fill the
detector  with liquid scintillator.  By dissolving 150 Neodymium, 
they can look for neutrinoless double beta decay.  There are also 
reactor neutrino, geoneutrino  and solar neutrino capabilities.

*** Double Chooz Reactor Nu Experiment getting ready
</H1> <P>
*** Double Chooz Reactor Nu Experiment getting ready
Phototube installation is complete for the far detector. And the
scaffolding was removed without damaging any tubes.  The acrylic 
tanks are next.

*** Daya Bay Reactor Nu Experiment getting ready
</H1> <P>
One attraction of the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment is the 
nearby large mountain which can provide a large overburden, and 
hence low potential backgrounds for a theta-13 search.  The Daya 
Bay tunnels from two directions have joined up, and the civil 
construction is continuing towards the region for the far detector.  
The detectors will be built in a nearby lab and moved into the 
mountain in pairs.  This moving of the detectors is independent of 
the idea to later move the detectors again by swapping them to 
reduce systematic errors.  Some outsiders are skeptical that moving 
these triple volume detectors while filled with liquid can be 
reliably done.  But the alternative plan of building the detectors 
in place and moving the mountain was rejected, and the idea of 
moving the reactors isn't practical either.  Another neutrino lab 
will be built in China at Jinping Mountain in Sichuan Province.

*** RENO Reactor Experiment in South Korea getting ready

The halls for South Korea's RENO neutrino near and far detectors are ready.

*** MINOS getting ready to switch to antineutrinos
</H1> <P>
The Fermilab NuMI beam is currently in a shutdown that is scheduled
to end in September.  The MINOS project will switch the sign of
the horn and magnets in order to run with antineutrinos.
This will allow MINOS to quantitatively check if Delta msquared
is the same for neutrinos and antineutrinos.

*** New DOE official asks, "Why do neutrinos?"
</H1> <P>
William Brinkman, a senior research physicist in the Department of 
Physics at Princeton University, has been confirmed by the U.S. 
Senate as director of the Office of Science in the U.S. Department 
of Energy.  The office is the single largest supporter of basic 
research in the physical sciences in the United States, providing 
more than 40 percent of total funding in this vital area. It 
oversees -- and is the principal federal funding agency of -- the 
nation's research programs in high-energy physics, nuclear physics 
and fusion energy sciences. The Office of Science also manages 10 
national laboratories.  His first question to the HEP community 
involved the neutrino sector, which is the key to future facilities
in the last P5 report (Project X, new beamline, DUSEL, megaton scale
detector.)  A group of Fermilab administrators and theorists visited
him and explained the rationale for neutrino research in the U.S.

*** Lucia Votano named Director of Gran Sasso
</H1> <P>
Lucia Votano has been appointed by the Board of Directors of the 
Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN) as the Director of 
the National Laboratory in Gran Sasso, the world's largest 
underground laboratory for astroparticle physics. She has been 
Chairperson of the Collaboration Board of the OPERA experiment (Oscillation Project with 
Emulsion-tRacking Apparatus),

*** Neutrino Predictions from String Theory (F-theory GUTs)
</H1> <P>
With string theory and two simple assumptions, a no-free-parameter
first-order estimates can be made of the quark and lepton mixing
matrices.  The assumptions - 1) A GUT exists & 2) Particle physics 
is not changed in the absence of gravity (the Planck mass).  The 
only parameter is alpha-GUT=0.04, determined from running the measured 
coupling constants to the GUT scale.  Predicts CKM elements well;
normal hierarchy, dmsq_32 = 30X dmsq_21 (data 31+-2); m1=0.002eV;  
q-23=q-12=27 deg (data 34+-1 and 45+-7) and q-13=12 deg.  It also 
predicts delta.

And a 10-100 MeV gravitino is the dark matter.
