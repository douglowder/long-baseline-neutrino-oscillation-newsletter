*** SNO done, and SNO+ getting ready
</h1> <p>
The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory used its heavy water to measure
(with a combined fit) theta-12 (34.4 +- 1.3 degrees) and Delta m^2
(7.59 e-5+-0.2 eV^2).

It didn't want to lose any
D20 and it didn't lose any.  I has given it all back to the AECL
and it gave it back cleaner.  But they kept everything else
(acrylic, tubes, ...)   Next a new collaboration will fill the
detector  with liquid scintillator.  By dissolving 150 Neodymium,
they can look for neutrinoless double beta decay.  There are also
reactor neutrino, geoneutrino  and solar neutrino capabilities.

*** Double Chooz Reactor Nu Experiment getting ready
Phototube installation is complete for the far detector. And the
scaffolding was removed without damaging any tubes.  The acrylic
tanks are next.

*** Daya Bay Reactor Nu Experiment getting ready
</h1> <p>
One attraction of the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment is the
nearby large mountain which can provide a large overburden, and
hence low potential backgrounds for a theta-13 search.  The Daya
Bay tunnels from two directions have joined up, and the civil
construction is continuing towards the region for the far detector.
The detectors will be built in a nearby lab and moved into the
mountain in pairs.  This moving of the detectors is independent of
the idea to later move the detectors again by swapping them to
reduce systematic errors.  Some outsiders are skeptical that moving
these triple volume detectors while filled with liquid can be
reliably done.  But the alternative plan of building the detectors
in place and moving the mountain was rejected, and the idea of
moving the reactors isn't practical either.  Another neutrino lab
will be built in China at Jinping Mountain in Sichuan Province.

*** MINOS getting ready to switch to antineutrinos
</h1> <p>
The Fermilab NuMI beam is currently in a shutdown that is scheduled
to end in September.  The MINOS project will switch the sign of
the horn and magnets in order to run with antineutrinos.
This will allow MINOS to quantitatively check if Delta msquared
is the same for neutrinos and antineutrinos.

*** New DOE official asks, "Why do neutrinos?"
</h1> <p>
William Brinkman, a senior research physicist in the Department of
Physics at Princeton University, has been confirmed by the U.S.
Senate as director of the Office of Science in the U.S. Department
of Energy.  The office is the single largest supporter of basic
research in the physical sciences in the United States, providing
more than 40 percent of total funding in this vital area. It
oversees -- and is the principal federal funding agency of -- the
nation's research programs in high-energy physics, nuclear physics
and fusion energy sciences. The Office of Science also manages 10
national laboratories.  His first question to the HEP community
involved the neutrino sector, which is the key to future facilities
in the last P5 report (Project X, new beamline, DUSEL, megaton scale
detector.)  A group of Fermilab administrators and theorists visited
him and explained the rationale for neutrino research in the U.S.

*** Lucia Votano named Director of Gran Sasso
</h1> <p>
Lucia Votano has been appointed by the Board of Directors of the
Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN) as the Director of
the National Laboratory in Gran Sasso, the world's largest
underground laboratory for astroparticle physics. She has been
Chairperson of the Collaboration Board of the OPERA experiment (Oscillation Project with
Emulsion-tRacking Apparatus),

*** Neutrino Predictions from String Theory (F-theory GUTs)
</h1> <p>
With string theory and two simple assumptions, a no-free-parameter
first-order estimates can be made of the quark and lepton mixing
matrices.  The assumptions - 1) A GUT exists &amp; 2) Particle physics
is not changed in the absence of gravity (the Planck mass).  The
only parameter is alpha-GUT=0.04, determined from running the measured
coupling constants to the GUT scale.  Predicts CKM elements well;
normal hierarchy, dmsq_32 = 30X dmsq_21 (data 31+-2); m1=0.002eV;
q-23=q-12=27 deg (data 34+-1 and 45+-7) and q-13=12 deg.  It also
predicts delta.
