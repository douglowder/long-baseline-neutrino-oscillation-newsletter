<p>
</p><h1>*** NuSAG/EPP2010 reports coming
</h1>
The final draft of the Neutrino Scientific Assessment Group
NuSAG report on reactor neutrino and accelerator neutrino projects
has been sent to the new members of NSAC and HEPAP (the DOE nuclear
and particle physics advisory committees.)  Public in March, maybe.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Fermilab Long-Baseline Workshop 6-7 March 06
</h1>
FNAL and BNL are planning a joint study on possible very-long-
baseline neutrino experiments using an upgraded proton source at
Fermilab. This study would consider physics opportunities for
exploring nu masses and mixings at a follow-up experiment to
the first phase of NOvA.  A kickoff workshop will be held at FNAL
6-7 March. No registration.  For planning, tell .

<p>
</p><h1>*** SciBooNE approved at Fermilab; E954
</h1>
FNAL approve an experiment to use the K2K-SciBar detector in the
the FNAL Booster Neutrino Beam Line, called SciBooNE.  You can
find a recommendation from FNAL PAC at
<a href="http://www.fnal.gov/directorate/program_planning/Dec2005PACPublic/December2005PACReport.pdf">

</a>
The proposal is posted at
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0601022"> hep-ex/0601022.  </a>
Data in fall 2006.

<p>
</p><h1>*** MiniBooNE running with antineutrinos
</h1>
Running with anti-nus, MiniBooNE gets a new number, E944.  They
recorded their first antineutrino January 19 and already have
quite a few.  Reversing the horn and magnets took about 2 weeks.

<p>
</p><h1>*** NOvA Spokesperson election
</h1>
In a close election, Mark Messier from Indiana, was chosen NOvA
cospokesperson, joining Gary Feldman from Harvard.  Fermilab's
John Cooper ends his term but continues as Project Manager.  This
long-baseline Fermilab nu experiment has challenging reviews soon.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Neutrino R&amp;D funding in the U.S.
</h1>
The U.S. HEP DOE office called for expressions of interest for R&amp;D
activities which will further progress on various nu initiatives.

</a>
They were due 27 Jan and collaborations were to submit a single
proposal.   Proposals were written by NOvA, T2K-US, Braidwood,
Double Chooz US, Daya Bay US, and UNO, among others.  About $8M
is thought to be involved, mostly from an 06 R&amp;D funding line item.

<p>
</p><h1>*** President's Budget has money for NOvA
</h1>
In the proposed 07 budget, there is an increase for HEP of $58.4M in
the $775M budget. "Project engineering and design funding of $10.3M
is requested for the new electron neutrino appearance project."

<p>
</p><h1>*** EU funding for Neutrino Telescopes
</h1>
9.0 M Euro from the EU has been approved for the Design Study of
the km^3 nu telescope Neutrino Telescope in the Mediterranean.
It starts 1 Feb and will last 3 years.  The total cost is 20 ME;
the remaining 11M will be covered by the national contributions of
the eight Europen countries which participate.  28 Institutions


<p>
</p><h1>*** UK funding for Braidwood; and a poem
</h1>
A UK seedcorn request for UK participation in the U.S. Braidwood
reactor neutrino experiment was approved in full.   The U.S.
part of the collaboration is waiting for NuSAG while humming
"Rule Britannia"

</p><h1>*** The Neutrino of Love; A poem and an opinion
</h1>
<a href="http://www.dylancasey.org/NeutrinoSessions/NeutrinoofLove.htm">
http://www.dylancasey.org/NeutrinoSessions/NeutrinoofLove.htm
</a>
A free MP3 extols the "neutrino of love".  The author of this
newsletter often offers opinions, and it is my opinion that
readers will enjoy the lyrics, if not the music.  Also see the
neutrino poetry page:

<p>
</p><h1>*** Physics funding in the U.S.; and another opinion
</h1>
In his State of the Union address, President Bush said:
"I propose to double the federal commitment to the most critical
basic research programs in the physical sciences over the
next 10 years."  Is neutrino research critical?  I think so.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Neutrino lectures at Fermilab
</h1>
A series of Academic lectures focuses on "The New World of
Neutrino Physics".  11 lectures starting 7 Feb to 14 Mar.

</p><h1>*** Neutrino summer schools in 2006 in Munich and Scotland
</h1>
There will be the International School on Astro-Particle Physics
European Doctorate School Neutrinos in Physics: Munich 23-31 May.
And the Scottish Universities Summer School in Physics will cover
"Nus in Particle Physics, Astrophysics and Cosmology" 8-23 Aug.

</p><h1>*** Doug Michael memorial service at Cal Tech
</h1>
The MINOS Collaboration lost its co-spokesperson, friend and
colleague Doug Michael last month. Doug's life, accomplishments
and aspirations were celebrated at a Caltech memorial service on
28 Jan in a number of moving talks by family members, classmates,
and MACRO and MINOS colleagues. MINOS co-spokesperson Stan Wojcicki,
noted "Doug was the heart and soul of the MINOS experiment," which
stands as his lasting legacy.  Donations for Douglas Grant Michael
can be at:

</p><h1>*** Beams for European Neutrino Experiments Document (BENE)
</h1>
BENE has a document proposing a strategy of R&amp;D steps for Europe
towards a new precision neutrino facility.  It will be published
as ECFA reference ECFA/06/242 and as a CERN report.  In July, in
Lisbon, a "strategy document" will be issued.
