<p> </p><h1>
*** COSMOS withdrawn
</h1>With the loss of their emulsion target, COSMOS spokesman Bill
Reay met Fermilab director John Peoples after which the COSMOS
experiment was withdrawn.   The collaboration had asked Fermilab
if it was willing to get involved in the emulsion buying and
scanning fronts, but as expected, this was not met with the
requisite enthusiasm or funds.   The Fermilab beam group is
looking into how this will lower the cost of the near detector
area.  The COSMOS groups have been invited to join TOSCA at CERN.

<p> </p><h1>
*** MINOS lease and blasting
</h1>The MINOS experiment has now signed a long-term lease with the
Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) which will allow
the digging of the cavity towards Fermilab.  Eight test blasts
using up to 18 pounds of dynamite were set off to study the
frequency response of various elements of the Soudan 2 hall and
detector.   Everything survived the blasting, including a module
nearby with high voltage on.  The MINOS cavity is now 0.1% done.

<p> </p><h1>
*** K2K beam pipe completed
</h1>K2K is on schedule for a January 1999 startup with the 12 GeV ps.
No firm schedule yet exists for the proposed 50 GeV machine, but
neutrino possibilities include further K2K running at higher
energy, or LSND-type tests at the 3 GeV machine.

<p> </p><h1>
*** New MINOS review in response to Gilman panel
</h1>The Gilman report endorsed the long-baseline program at Fermilab
and suggested  a careful evaluation of the configuration of the
facility; presumably the beam energy.  Fermilab has assembled a
panel headed by C. Baltay to review the physics of MINOS in May.

*** The Future:  Neutrino to miss earth in 2028
</h1>According to calculations obtained by long-baseline news, one
neutrino will pass within 30,000 miles of earth in October 2028,
while another one will miss the earth by 600,000.  We are fairly
sure that neither one will pass through the asteroid 1997XF11.

*** The Past:  Solar neutrino oscillations in 1969.
</h1>According to a 1969 issue of Scientific American on the solar nu
problem, "...The most imaginative idea has come from the USSR,
where Gribov and Pontecorvo have proposed that neutrinos have a
kind of double identity: approximately half the time they are
the ordinary `e nus' we suppose them to be but half the time
they are `mu nus'. ... It will not be easy to test this unusual
hypothesis, but it cannot be lightly dismissed.''  Several solar
nu "popular articles" are at
<a href="http://www.sns.ias.edu/~jnb/">
http://www.sns.ias.edu/~jnb/, </a> which
is available (of course) from the neutrino oscillation industry
web page <a href="http://www.hep.anl.gov/NDK/Hypertext/nuindustry.html">

*** OPERA web page linked to Neutrino Oscillation Industry
</h1>OPERA, "Oscillation Project with Emulsion-tRacking Apparatus".
is a massive lead/emulsion target for a long-baseline experiment.
It will search for numu to nutau in the parameter region
indicated by the atmospheric neutrino anomaly. It exploits
nuclear emulsion for the unambiguous detection of taus.  OPERA
will run at the LNGS in the future neutrino beam from CERN.

*** New EOI for low energy long-baseline from INFN
</h1>An EOI for a new long-baseline experiment has been submitted to
Gran Sasso on Feb. 4th.  Several INFN groups are considering a
new experiment with a low energy beam for low delta m^2.
With a 4 GeV (E-nu) beam, they get to 5 10^-4 eV^2
(superoptimistically?) assuming 100 events/kiloton/10^19 pot.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Palo Verde lab completed
</h1>The low background laboratory at Palo Verde has been completed.
The neutron shielding water tanks are in place. The detector was
being installed during February and March.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Taiwan reactor experiment TEXONO
</h1>The Taiwan EXperiment ON reactor neutrinOs will use low energy
neutrinos as a probe for the first time.  Using a 600 kg CsI
pilot detector near the NPSI, II and IV reactors.  If they reach
their goal of 100 keV threshold, they will study low energy nu-e
elastic scattering and search for a nu magnetic moment.  The
collaboration has several groups from Taiwan, China and the US.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Satellite symposium after neutrino '98
</h1>A meeting aimed at young physicists in Japan will be June 10-11
in Tokyo.  Contact 

<p> </p><h1>
*** Zeuthen workshop on km^3
</h1>An International Workshop on "Simulation and Analysis Methods
for Cube Kilometer Neutrino Detectors" will be held at DESY
Zeuthen, Germany on July 6-9, 1998.   For details see
