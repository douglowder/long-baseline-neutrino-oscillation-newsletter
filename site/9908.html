<p> </p><h1>
*** CERN proposals
</h1>Several Neutrino proposals have been turned in, including ICANOE,
I216 and OPERA.  (below) They will be discussed at a CERN meeting
during September and decisions are expected in December.

<p> </p><h1>
*** K2K Horn failure
</h1>When running at maximum current (250kA) the KEK horn broke:
the flexible twisted wire connection between horn and stripline
(replaced with solid copper strips); the stainless steel water
cooling manifold (replaced temporarily with rubber hose); the
horn inner conductor piece which doubles as the target (will be
replaced with a larger stronger piece.  The end wall is also
being redesigned to be stiffer.) A spare horn will run at reduced
current until the redesigned horn is ready in a few months.

<p> </p><h1>
*** KEK neutrino beam workshop
</h1>Besides reports on KEK's neutrino success and hardware problems,
there was discussion on horns for NGS at CERN and NuMI at FNAL
which are under development.  CERN is in the process of building
a prototype horn for NGS, which will have a welded inner
conductor.  The design current is 150 kA, but the horns are still
6 m long.  NUMI is building a prototype horn, to be ready next
winter. (I=200 kA).  NUMI horns are about half the size of CERN
horns.  Next nu beam workshop at FNAL sometime next year.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Confidence
</h1>Lincoln Wolfenstein is confident in Super-K results, but not in
their confidence levels.  John Ellis gives personal % confidence
rates as follows:  Nus mass(99), &lt; 1 eV(90); Supersymmetry(80),
LSP most of CDM (60); Lambda not 0 (90),  Omega-Lambda big (50).

<p> </p><h1>
*** MINOS in budget which hasn't passed
</h1>$22M for the NuMI beam is in both the House and Senate Bills for
FY00.  When delivered, $41.8 of 76.2 TEC will have been
appropriated.  MINOS and Soudan funds are not line item but are
"Other Project Costs".  The budget plan which Fermilab says it
will try hard to achieve shows $13.5M in FY00.  This would
represent $20.3M out of $59.9 OPC funds.

<p> </p><h1>
*** MINOS extraction
</h1>MINOS has been asked to consider switching from fast resonant
extraction (1 millisecond) to Single Turn Extraction (10
microseconds).   This could cause a neutrino rate problem in the
near detector.  Faster electronics is being designed.  There
would be savings in shielding around the extraction septa.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrinos, Hilary Clinton love New York from Cornell to BNL
</h1>A recent meeting at the NSF focused on how the NSF and Cornell
might get involved in a muon-collider/neutrino factory.  NSF
might have an interest in playing a major (~500M$) role in the
neutrino factory.  It could be located at Brookhaven.

<p> </p><h1>
*** NNN Program;  (None of the N's are for New York.)
</h1>The program for the September 23-25 Stonybrook Workshop on the
Next Generation Nucleon Decay and Neutrino Detector at Stonybrook
is set.  See <a href="http://superk.physics.sunysb.edu/NNN99">
http://superk.physics.sunysb.edu/NNN99 </a>.

<p> </p><h1>
*** High Altitude Muons from balloons check nu fluxes.
</h1>HEAT has 10665 events, MASS has about 3000 and Caprice 4627.
There are discrepancies with calculations at high altitude, but
3D calculations (in progress) reduce some discrepancies.  Mu+/Mu-
ratios vary from 1.2 to 1.6 but may depend on latitude
(geomagnetic cutoff).  Changes in the mu flux are more sensitive
to many effects than the nu flux because neutrino detectors
integrate over the height in the atmosphere.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrino Telescopes; AMANDA, NESTOR, NEMO, ANTARES, BAIKAL
</h1>AMANDA has 16 atmospheric nu events in 85 days.  The background
is pretty small, but they need more Monte Carlo to be sure.
NESTOR will be in the Ionian Sea, 3800m deep, 30km to counthouse.
The cable installation has been delayed but should be in place with
12 modules in 1999. They hope for data in 2001.  NEMO is a new
nu telescope idea considering sites in the Ionian and Tyrrhenian
Seas for km^3 arrays, 3300-3550 m deep.  ANTARES near Marseilles
will deploy a prototype in September '99 and finalize conceptual
design next month.  They need to position the array not too close
to two unexploded bombs they found.  Baikal has 196 tubes
deployed and continues to take data.

*** Additions to Neutrino Oscillation Industry Web Site
</h1>
<a href="http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/nuindustry.html">
http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/nuindustry.html </a> includes new
links to HERON (solar), Aqua-RICH and ICANOE (long-baseline).
Also a new page on Neutrinos from Horizontal Air Showers includes
links to AUGER, HiRES, AGASA, OWL and the Telescope Array.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrino transparencies available
</h1>Most conferences/workshops now make their transparencies
available after a meeting.  The
<a href="http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/numeetings.html">
"neutrino meetings" </a> web page
keeps links to meetings that are over, and direct links to
transparencies when possible.  They are now available from the
"Neutrinos at the Next Millenium", "HEP99" and also the
proceedings from the 26th ICRC.  See link on the Industry page.
