*** New results from T2K on theta-13
</H1> <P>
T2K has presented results for electron neutrino appearance with
6.39e20 protons on target, 2.1 times what was previously reported.
They observed 28 events, with 4.64 background expected and 20.4 
appearance expected (for sin^2 2q13=0.1, maximal q23 and delta 0).  
q=0 is excluded at 7.5 sigma.  A new reconstruction algorithm 
removes 70% of the pizeros relative to the previous analysis.
The T2K experiment expects to collect 10 times more data in the 
near future, including data with antinus for studies of CP.

*** First results from GERDA neutrinoless double beta decay
</H1> <P>
There was a previous claim to see 0nubeta-beta in Germanium in PLB
586-198(2004).  GERDA is testing this claim with a low background 
Germanium detector in Gran Sasso.  With 21.6 kg-yr of data, they 
see 3 (0) events in +-2 (+-1) sigma of the expected value, with 
5.9 signal and 2.0 BG expected.  They rule out the previous claim 
(aka Klapdor) with high probability.   The lower limit on the half 
life is 2.1 e25 years (90%CL) corresponding to an upper limit on 
the effective electron nu mass "mee" < 0.2-0.4 eV (depending on 
matrix elements).

*** A question for people who think they use a 5 sigma criterion
</H1> <P>
Does anybody care that Klapdor's claim hasn't been ruled out at
five sigma?  (I sure hope not.)

*** LBNE report for Snowmass
</H1> <P>
The Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) from Fermilab to
South Dakota has issued a report for Snowmass describing in some
detail "Scientific Opportunities with the Long-Baseline Neutrino
Experiment".  Snowmass paper SNOW13-00081 and

*** The first 13 other Snowmass neutrino white papers

Previously, the neutrino group for Snowmass asked for

white papers </a> and there are 85 of them.  Now they are inviting 
papers which can be longer for the proceedings.  The "SNOW" list

*** A question for Theorists about the neutrino mass hierarchy
</H1> <P>
I am asking the following question to a number of theorists and 
am getting a variety of nuanced answers.  Any theorist who does or 
doesn't have an opinion, please let me know.   The next thing
we will probably measure is the neutrino mass hierarchy.  It will 
either be "normal" or "inverted".  The charged leptons and quarks 
have what we would call a "normal" mass hierarchy.  If we measure 
an inverted neutrino hierarchy, is there anything we might glean
from this, or are all theories agnostic?  Would it be surprising?

*** Kevin Costner selling South Dakota land
</H1> <P>
New rules and their varied implementations are causing trouble and 
even wasting money for physicists & physics conference organizers.  
A GSA "Las Vegas meeting scandal" is blamed.  I've never been to a 
physics meeting Las Vegas.  Many Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment 
meetings will probably take place in nearby Deadwood SD.  But no
meetings will take place soon in the proposed $100M Dunbar Casino.

*** SNO+, a million Isaacs
</H1> <P>
SNO+ reuse the SNO detector and look for neutrinoless double beta 
decay, among other things.  They decided to switch from loading 
the scintillator with neodymium-150 to tellurium-130. This has a 
34% isotopic abundance, so an initial 0.3% loading will be 810 kg.  
The ratio of two neutrino beta decay to zero neutrino is 50 times 
better. But the lower Q-value means that they need to reject some 
other backgrounds.  They now think they can tag bismuth-214 decays 
using delayed coincidence to the 10^(-4) level.  They will fill 
with water in 2013 and with scintillator in 2014.  SNO was held up
but they need to hold SNO+ down with a million Newtons.

<H1>
*** g-2 for nu_1, nu_2 and nu_3
</H1> <P>
It should be close to negative two.  Our muon friends will measure 
it for mus precisely.  BNL's mu ring just got to Fermilab.  It is 
not Katrin, but this reminds us of that move 9 years ago.  Nus 
have better music.

</H1> <P>
Beam is circulating again in the Main Injector after the long
shutdown, and nu beam (for MINOS, NOvA, MINERvA) will start soon.
