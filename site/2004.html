*** T2K CP studies appear in Nature
</h1> <p>
Details of T2K CP studies released in October
(<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03887"> arXiv: 1910.03887</a>)
using nus and antinus have been published in Nature and generated
much publicity.

Matter and Antimatter matters matter.

*** T2K and the press
</h1> <p>
Many press reports discuss the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the
universe and CP violation.  Neutrino physicists are aware that
leptogenesis provides a plausible connection, but the story isn't
over.  In translating that story for the press, misstatements
abound, which mostly don't matter.  In a provocative blog, I was
struck by "few people care about CP violation in the nu sector."

*** Fewer neutrinos during pandemic
</h1> <p>
During the "work at home" days, the major labs are closed and
beams are shut off.  At FNAL for example, the beam is off for the
rest of the fiscal year.  But some experiments are keeping their
detectors going, such as NOvA for supernova &amp; cosmic ray studies.

</p><h1>
*** Neutrino 2020 and 2030
</h1> <p>
Neutrino 2020 will be a virtual conference, starting 22 June and
extended to run Mon-Thu over 2 weeks with each day shortened to
4.5 hours.  International advisory committees overwhelmingly
supported an online conference over a conference postponed by a
year. Abstracts for posters were delayed until 8 May.  As of
1 May, over 550 abstracts had been received.  Registration details
(which will be free) will be posted on the web site soon.

Neutrino 2030 in Zurich will
be a live meeting for the Pauli Centennial Celebration, except for
those of us whose presence is required at a ball.

</p><h1>
*** NuFACT2020 and ICHEP
</h1> <p>
ICHEP 2020 will be a virtual meeting, with parallel sessions
28-31 Jul &amp; plenaries 3-6 Aug.
<a href="http://ichep2020.org/">
http://ichep2020.org/
</a>
ICHEP 2024
will be in Prague.  NuFACT2020 in Sardinia, on the other hand,
will be held on 21-26 June 2021.  It is OK to call it  NuFACT2021.

</p><h1>
*** Neutrino backgrounds
</h1> <p>
With meetings at home on zoom, ... we get to see in the background
what people have on their walls and bookshelves.  Books such as
"Neutrino" by Frank Close can be seen, as well as classics such as
"The structure of scientific revolutions" by Thomas Kuhn, and the
Feynman lectures.  Some choose to use a virtual background, (arrow
next to video in zoom) &amp; a large neutrino detector is an obvious
choice.  Please share with me any good neutrino backgrounds.

</p><h1>
*** Neutrino Day goes virtual 11 July 2020
</h1> <p>
A Sanford Lab tradition, this year's neutrino day: a matter
mystery will be a virtual experience, with online chats, hands-on
activities, games, art activities, scavenger hunts and a science
comedian.

*** ICARUS filling with liquid Argon
</h1> <p>
The ICARUS detector, which came to Fermilab from LNGS, is part of
the short-baseline nu program to follow up on unexpected results
from MiniBooNE.  It started filling with liquid Argon in February
<a href="https://news.fnal.gov/2020/04/liquid-argon-delivery/">
https://news.fnal.gov/2020/04/liquid-argon-delivery/
</a>
and is now
full with 760 tons of liquid Argon.

*** RANT - how to write a date
</h1> <p>
The progression day-mon-yr has always made more sense to me than
mon-day-yr.  The inferior scheme is ingrained in many people, and
isn't going away.  When you make a hotel reservation on many
websites, be careful that you are choosing the dates you want!

</p><h1>
*** Neutrino Interaction drawn by hand
</h1> <p>
It has been a while since physicists recorded their data with a
pencil &amp; paper.  But Third-grader Maria Esperanza Castro Torres of
San Cristóbal, Venezuela showed it's still a good skill to have.

*** Neutrino Music by David Ibbett
</h1> <p>
In the “Particle of Doubt,” scored for soprano, violin, viola,
cello, piano and electronics, you can almost hear an oscillation.
