<p> </p><h1>
*** CERN Council endorses long-baseline (CNGS) program
</h1>On December 17th,
<a href="http://www.cern.ch/Press/Releases99/PR14.99EGranSasso.html">
CERN approved the nu program to Gran Sasso </a>
by a vote 17-3.   The CERN director is
quoted "The approval of the CERN Neutrinos to Gran Sasso
Facility is a tremendous boost to Europe's strong community of
neutrino physicists."  The neutrinos will go from CERN below Mont
Blanc, Aosta, Allesandria (where they cross the river Po), the
Appenine Chain (where they reach their maximum depth of about
8km), Florence (at a depth of about 4 km) and Assisi.  2.5
milliseconds after creation they will arrive at Gran Sasso.

<p> </p><h1>
*** ICANOE
</h1>The SPSC committee was satisfied with the ICANOE proposal and
impressed by the quality and amount of work presented.  The
realization of the T600 module remains an important milestone.
The proposed modular structure allows for useful data in 2005.

<p> </p><h1>
*** OPERA
</h1>The SPSC committee appreciated the progress made in optimizing
the detector design, cost estimates, and schedule.  A full
proposal is due during the summer of 2000.  Data-taking in 2005
with a completed detector was deemed feasible.

<p> </p><h1>
*** What will you be doing May 15, 2005?
</h1>That's the day data taking for the experiments at Gran Sasso is
planned to begin.  Over half of the 71 million Swiss francs
required for the project, in addition to the equipment valued at
22 million Swiss francs already existing at CERN, are being
provided by INFN.  Contributions from Belgium, France, Germany
and Spain complete the funding.

*** Santa Claus found to have mass
</h1>For the second year in a row, the gravitational property of a
fundamental object is the main scientific story of the year.
Last years's story, the discovery of neutrino mass by Super-
Kamiokande, has already made it to a college textbook (Modern
Physics by Tipler &amp; Llewellyn).  Santa Claus' mass is probably
related to the fact that he always accepts cookies, something
he was told to do to get his web browser to work well.

<p> </p><h1>
*** European Mirror site of long-baseline news has moved
</h1>It is now at:
<a href="http://hepunx.rl.ac.uk/longbnews/">
http://hepunx.rl.ac.uk/longbnews/ </a>
The mirror relies on a robot which can take up to one day.
There is also now a European mirror for the neutrino oscillation
industry page:  <a href="http://hepunx.rl.ac.uk/neutrino-industry/">
http://hepunx.rl.ac.uk/neutrino-industry/ </a>

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrino factory meeting in UK
</h1>On 7th December a 1/2 day meeting of the UK PP community was held
in Oxford to discuss 'The Physics Opportunities of a Neutrino
Factory'. The meeting drew a large attendance to hear speakers
from CERN, the US and the UK on the status of neutrino
oscillations and the physics potential of high intensity muon and
neutrino beams from muon storage rings.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Another workshop on "Limits" at Fermilab
</h1>The CERN workshop on Confidence Levels this month is full, but if
you are at Fermilab March 27-28, there will be another workshop,
more at an instructional level.  Methods for setting limits
include the CL_s methods used by the LEP Higgs searches;
Bayesian; Feldman-Cousins and modifications thereof; etc.
Proponents of the various methods will speak.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrino Jobs page
</h1>A page with neutrino job notices has been linked to the
neutrino oscillation industry home page.  It can be found at
<a href="http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/jobs/jobs.htm">
http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/jobs/jobs.htm</a>.  Positions will be
posted as I get them, but may become outdated.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Is the (atmospheric) nu mass scale cosmologically relevant?
</h1><a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-ph/9912363">
Lesgourgues et al. </a> argue that a 0.07 eV neutrino affects
structure formation and microwave background anisotropies
provided that a relic neutrino asymmetry exists.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrino Anarchy
</h1>Does the mass matrix have an ordered pattern, perhaps governed by
a flavor symmetry, or is it random?
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-ph/9911341">
Hall et al, </a> choose random.
