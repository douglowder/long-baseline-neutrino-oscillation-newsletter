<H1>Long-Baseline news, June 2012 </H1>
<P> 

<H1>
*** LBNE reconfiguration progress; feedback sought
</H1> <P>
LBNE has settled on a 10 kiloton far detector on the surface at 
Homestake.  It is encouraged to get its baseline funding estimate 
(CD1) with a Lehman review in October/November.  The interim report:
https://indico.fnal.gov/getFile.py/access?resId=0&materialId=3&confId=5622
Public or private feedback is solicited by 20 July through the 
DPF newsletter.

*** New results from Double Chooz at Neutrino 2012
</H1> <P>
Using the rate and energy shape, Double Chooz reactor antineutrino
disappearance experiment now measures sin^2(2 q13) = 0.109 +- 
0.030(stat) +-0.025(syst), & rejects no oscillations at 3.1 sigma.
It has a week with both reactors off, useful to study backgrounds.

*** New results from Daya Bay at Neutrino 2012
</H1> <P>
The Daya Bay reactor antineutrino disappearance experiment showed
an improved measurement with more than 2.5 times the data from
their publication.  Using the rates at near and far detectors,
they see 0.944 +-0.007(stat) +-0.003(syst) of the expected rate
at the Far Detector, and fit to sin^2(2 q13) = 0.089 +-0.010
(stat) +- 0.005(syst), the most precise measurement of theta13.

*** New results from Minerva at Neutrino 2012
</H1> <P>
Minerva has measured the the antineutrino Quasi-elastic cross
section off scintillator & shown Q^2 distribution.  The large
axial-vector m value of 1.35 GeV is disfavored and there is a dip
in the data at low Q^2.  Data with nuclear targets are coming.

<H1>
*** New results from EXO200 at Neutrino 2012
</H1> <P>
Using a 32.5 kg-yr of data 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5608"> (arXiv:1205.5608) 
</A>
and 22,000 2nu-2beta
events, they measure a half life of 2.23 +- 0.017(stat) +- 0.22
(sys) 10^(21) yr for 136Xe.  They observe no signal in the
0nu-2beta region of interest (5 events within 2 sigma, with 7.5
expected from the background fit.)  They limit the lifetime to
be greater than 1.6 10^25 years, and the effective mass to be
less than 140-380 meV at 90% CL.  Klapdor is mostly ruled out.

<H1>
*** New results from Super-K at Neutrino 2012
</H1> <P>
Solar nu rate best fit flux is now 2.39 10^6/(cm^2 s) for SK-III.
1069 days of SK-IV has new electronics, a lower threshold & higher 
efficiency.  The 3904 day analysis sees 57721.3 solar nus, with a
best fit to .451 +- 0.007 of the unoscillated expected flux.  The
Day-Night Amplitude (-2.8+-1.1+-0.5%), "consistent
with zero at 2.3 sigma".  Also called a Day/Night hint.
Atmospheric nus updated +1097 days to 3903 days and with theta_13
Delta msquared = 2.66 +.15-.40 10^-3 eV^2 at one sigma and 
sin^2(q23) = .391 to .691 at 90%CL.  There is now 3.8 sigma
signal for tau neutrino appearance with the reactor constraint.

<H1>
*** New results from T2K at Neutrino 2012
</H1> <P>
Based on 2.56e20 pot collected by May 2012, T2K now has 10 events
(6 before) for electron neutrino appearance in a muon neutrino 
beam in Japan.  This is equivalent to a 3.2 sigma excess compared
to no oscillations, and fits to sin^2(2 q13) = 0.104+0.060-0.045.
The systematic error is now at the level of 10%.  After the Mar
2011 earthquake, J-PARC/T2K restarted with 190kW beam power.

<H1>
*** New results from MINOS at Neutrino 2012
</H1> <P>
With 10.71e20 pot nus, MINOS gets best fit delta m^2_32 = 2.41 +
.11 -.10 10^-3 eV^2 and sin^2(2q) = 0.94 +0.04 -0.05.  Systematics
are still small.  For antinus 3.36e20 pot, and delta m^2_32 = 2.48 
+.22 -.27 10^-3 eV^2, sin^2(2q23) > 0.83 at 90%CL (best fit 0.97).  
For nue, expect 128.6 events, see 152 in nu, expect 17.5 antinu, 
see 20.  With sin^2(2q13)=0.1, would expect 32.5 and 3.7 more.  A 
joint fit with 37.9 kt-years of atmo nu data gives best fit 2.39 
+0.09 -0.10 10^-3 eV^2, sin^2(2q23) > 0.90 at 90%CL (best 0.96). 

<H1>
*** New results from OPERA at Neutrino 2012
</H1> <P>
The OPERA experiment in the higher energy long-baseline beam has 
found a second event consistent with muon neutrino to tau neutrino 
oscillations.  They have taken 14.2e19pot through 2011 and expect 
to have 18.9e19pot after the 2012 run, compared to 22.5e19pot in 
the proposal. They have found a second candidate tau event with 1 
nuclear fragment and one primary track and a tau flight length 
1.54mm which decayed into a 3 prong.  They now have two events 
with 2.1 expected signal & 0.2 background.  They have 19 electron
candidates, 4 with E<20GeV (expect 1.1 signal, 3.9 background).

<H1>
*** How quickly things change, Nobel laureate Leon Lederman
</H1> <P>
On 8 June, it was announced that former neutrino physicist Leon
Lederman was departing Fermilab on 11 Jun.  12 Jun he was back.

*** Congratulations to Higgs discoverers and to Higgs?
</H1> <P>
Since I congratulated my friends for the discovery of the Higgs at
125 GeV last December, I don't need to do it again.  (I think
Steven Colbert got it right on 7 March.)  But does the Higgs give 
mass to the Universe?  It accounts for 1% of the nucleon mass 
(rest glue) which makes up 4% of the Universe.   Neutrino mass may 
be all Higgs (Dirac) or not (Majorana).

*** Pop quiz
</H1> <P>
During the Venus transit of the sun, were more solar neutrinos
absorbed in Venus, or focused toward us by gravity?  Photo at
