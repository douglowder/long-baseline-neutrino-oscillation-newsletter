*** First data from ArgoNeuT
</h1> <p>
This 47 x 40 x 90 cm^3 TPC has its first result on the
measurement of the inclusive muon neutrino CC cross section on
Argon.

*** INO gets land from Tamil Nadu
</h1> <p>
The India-based Neutrino Observatory has passed another hurdle,
getting a land donation from the state of Tamil Nadu for
the cavern and its surface laboratory.  They also need to arrange for the
purchase of some land for an institute at Madurai.

*** Invisibles... for neutrinos, dark matter &amp; dark energy physics
</h1> <p>
Invisibles is a new European ITN project (FP7-PEOPLE-2011-ITN),
which focuses on Neutrino and Dark Matter phenomenology and their
connection. Experimental and theoretical aspects are also
encompassed. The network involves nodes in seven European
countries and its associated partners extend to seven non-European
countries.

*** Blog site for high intensity workshop (30 Nov-2 Dec Rockville)
</h1> <p>
To enable discussion of opinions and ideas for neutrinos at the
intensity frontier in advance of the Rockville meeting, we have
set up a discussion website:
<a href="http://neutrinowg.phy.duke.edu/"> http://neutrinowg.phy.duke.edu/
</a>
If you want to initiate a post, please contact one of the neutrino
working group conveners (Andre De Gouvea, Kevin Pitts, Kate
Scholberg or Sam Zeller).  Anyone can make comments on the posts,
although comments will be moderated.  They will publish all
non-anonymous comments from the community.

*** HEPAP news
</h1> <p>
Neutrinos were a big part of the October 2011 U.S. HEPAP meeting.

</a>
A. Lankford reported on the NRC DUSEL study, which looked at the
physics value of LBNE, dark matter and 0nu 2beta experiments.  He
reported that "The value of the whole is greater than the sum of
its parts" and that "The cost of the whole is less than the sum of
its parts."  H. Weerts reported on the upcoming Intensity Workshop.

</p><h1>
*** LBNE report and technology decision
</h1> <p>
The 2010 Physics Working Group Report prepared by the (now 320
member) LBNE collaboration and edited by Bob Wilson (Col State)
has appeared on the ArXiV.
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.6249"> http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.6249
</a>
More recent "case studies" detailing the water and argon choices
for the technology decision will be released soon.  Those
documents focus on the physics capabilities.  A description of
the full experiment including costs is being developed by
the project as the CD1 report.  The current schedule calls for
the technology choice to be made in December 2011.

*** More on neutrino velocity
</h1> <p>
According to the New Scientist, OPERA will repeat its neutrino
velocity measurements with shorter pulses from the SPS before it
submits its abstract for publication

</p><h1>
*** Neutrino Velocity Preprints
</h1> <p>
A large number of papers are being written regarding the OPERA
velocity result (I found 55 in the October arXiv.)  Yuri Shitov is
maintaining a web digest of these papers; so even though these are
recent and notable, I won't mention them in my "references" below.

*** Call for Neutrino Astrophysics papers
</h1> <p>
A Special Issue on "Frontiers in Neutrino Astrophysics," will
be published in Advances in High Energy Physics in July 2012. You
can find the Call for Papers for this Special Issue at
<a href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ahep/si/fna/ ">
http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ahep/si/fna/
</a>
and the deadline for
submission is 6 Jan 2012. The Special Issue is open to both
original research articles as well as review articles.

Raju was a creative and outstanding physicist most recently known
for his ideas on solar neutrino detection in LENS (Low Energy
Neutrino Spectroscopy) See
