<h1>Long-Baseline news, October 2009 </h1>

</p><h1>
*** SNO low energy solar neutrino data
</h1> <p>
SNO is over but is still presenting interesting new results.
in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2984"> arXiv:0910.2984 </a>
they have lowered the kinetic energy threshold
to 3.5 MeV and measure the total flux of active-flavor solar
neutrinos from Boron decay with uncertainty more than a factor
of 2 smaller than before.  theta_12=34.06 +1.16 -0.84; dmsq_21
=  7.59 +0.20-0.21e-5 eV^2.  As others before, they do a
global fit and get sin^2(theta_13) = 2.00 +2.09 -1.63 e-2.
In Figure 29, the LMA prediction is for an upturn at low E.
The data is noticeably low instead, but errors are large.

*** NOvA gets final construction approval; CD-3b,
</h1> <p>
On October 30th, the DOE gave final approval for CD3b; which
allows for a start of full construction on the NOvA project.
This required a tremendous amount of work on the part of
the project team -- John Cooper and Paul Derwent in particular.

</p><h1>
*** MicroBooNE receives CD-0
</h1> <p>
The MicroBooNE experiment at Fermilab will use a time-projection
chamber filled with 100 tons of liquid argon to look carefully
at low-energy neutrino interactions.  CD-0 is a designation
from the Department of Energy which establishes "mission need",
i.e. that we want to know more about low energy neutrinos.
A final cost (less than $20M) will be developed to ask for CD-1.

</p><h1>
*** LBNE, The best you can get for $900M (CD-0 soon)
</h1> <p>
LBNE, the (about to be renamed) experiment for a new long-baseline
beam/detector from Fermilab to DUSEL, has yet to get CD-0.  (With a
hyphen in the name, it is hard to go negative.)  But there is hope
for CD-0 by the end of the year.  Recent experience is that
projects over $1B receive undesirable added scrutiny by those above
the funding agencies, so the new beam/detector combination may end
up with a price cap near $900M.

</p><h1>
*** SciNOvA - new idea with an Expression of Interest at FNAL
</h1> <p>
Not even CD-minus-two (perhaps).  This is an idea to re-instrument
the SciBar detector (15 tons of solid scintillator, segmented
in 1.3 cm x 2.5 cm strips used recently by the SciBooNE experiment)
and deploy the detector in front of the NOvA near detector. It will
be presented to the Fermilab PAC in November by Messier &amp; Tayloe.

*** Time to repeat the 1995 guide on "key decisions" (now CDs)
</h1> <p>
KD-0: "Permission to think" - One can work on conceptual design.
</p><p>
KD-1: "Permission to think deeply" - One can develop Title I -
</p><p>
Means that major permitting has been accomplished, usually.
</p><p>
KD-2: "Permission to do detailed designs" - develop Title II
</p><p>
- Detailed engineering construction drawings. Permits in place.
</p><p>
KD-3: "You can build it" - Until now, no money can go for anything
</p><p>
real - up to this point it's all paper.
</p><p>
KD-4: "You can use it" - It may exist, but you can't use it until
</p><p>
DOE approves that it is o.k. to use it.

*** CERN Workshop on Neutrino Strategy summary
</h1> <p>
The European Strategy for Future Neutrino Physics program is kept
at
<a href="http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=59378">
http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=59378.  </a>
It
was only a beginning of a process. Neutrino physicists in Europe
have a program of R&amp;D projects (SPL, MERIT, MICE, EMMA) Design
Studies (EUROnu for beams, LAGUNA for underground sites) and
networking (NEu2012) which aims at providing inputs for decisions
to come.  The SPC neutrino panel is preparing its report for
December, and CERN management will hold a "retreat session" end of
November to review the upgrade of the LHC injectors.  The European
accelerator neutrino community will continue its interaction with
management to narrow down options only to realistic beam and
detector configurations. The option to revive the old PS
Gargammelle neutrino beam, devoting it to accelerator/detector
R&amp;D, is also being discussed.

</p><h1>
*** MICE beam and experiment gets money &amp; "Transnational Access"
</h1> <p>
The Science and Technology Facilities Council in the UK has
awarded 222K Euro for Transnational Access to the MICE (ionization
cooling) infrastructure. This aims at supporting experimentalists
from EU to investigate muon ionization cooling or to perform
neutrino detector tests with high quality low energy beams of
muons, electrons, protons or pions.  For information or to apply,

*** Are there Neutrino Acoustic Oscillations of cosmic neutrinos?
</h1> <p>
Some big bang neutrinos may be non-relativistic.  So the point of
last scattering is closer for the heaviest cosmic neutrinos than
for the lighter ones, or for light.
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.2887"> arXiv:0907.2887
</a>
and
<a href="http://focus.aps.org/story/v24/st15">
http://focus.aps.org/story/v24/st15  </a>
Even if one could
measure cosmic neutrinos, it appears we can't detect Neutrino
Acoustic Oscillations.
