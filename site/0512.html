<h1>Long-Baseline news,  December 2005 </h1>

<p> <h1>
*** In Memoriam, Doug Michael
</h1>
Doug Michael passed away on Christmas Day after a one year battle
with cancer.  A cospokesman of MINOS, he was a tireless dedicated
physicist, whose loss is that much greater because it seems he is
too young to report our loss of him.  I heard someone describe him 
as a jet plane, while we are traveling in helicopters.  Instead 
of flowers, donations have been requested for the LYMPHOMA 
Research Foundation in memory of Dr. Douglas Grant Michael.

*** CD0 for double beta decay, reactor and long-baseline neutrinos
</h1>
In response to the interest expressed in the critical design 0 on 
3 neutrino physics topics, the DOE has established a web page:
<a href="http://www.science.doe.gov/hep/newinitiatives.shtm"> 
http://www.science.doe.gov/hep/newinitiatives.shtm  </a>
The long-
baseline CD0 options include 1) NOvA, 2)T2K, 3) do nothing.  
Reactor options are 1) Double Chooz, 2) Daya Bay, 3) Braidwood, 
4) do nothing.  Request for CD0 for a high-intensity neutrino beam 
for neutrino CP-violation experiments will shortly follow. 

<p> <h1>
*** MINERvA is working on CD1 & 2
</h1>
DOE gave responsibility for MINERvA's CD1 to Fermilab in lieu of 
having a "Lehman" review.  After a successful Fermilab CD1 
Director's Review in December, MINERvA is preparing to submit the 
other documents required for CD1 early in 2006.  There will be 
another Director's Review in April 06 and a DOE CD2/3 June 06. 

<p> <h1>
*** Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Project
</h1>
Daya Bay has  begun bore-hole drilling which should take about
two months to complete. The Institute of High Energy Physics and 
several Chinese Institutions have awarded $2 million Chinese 
dollars from NSFC for carrying out R&D activities for the Daya Bay 
project a few months ago. This grant is good for one year. 

<p> <h1>
*** RENO funded in Korea for $9M
</h1>
In December 2005, the Congress in Korea approved the $9M that was 
requested for RENO, the Reactor Neutrino Oscillation Experiment.  
The collaboration so far consists of 10 institutions from Korea.

*** Combinations of Reactor and Accelerator Neutrino Measurements
</h1>
When theta_13 is measured by both reactor and accelerator 
experiments, it will tell us much more about nu mixing than 
precise measurements by 1 technique alone.  A recent preprint by
Mahn and Shaevitz shows some examples.

*** Fermilab reports low tritium in NuMI water to neighbors
</h1>
Fermilab surface water ponds look different this year, as they 
prepare to deal with a problem with zebra mussels, which is 
driving the timing of the next accelerator shutdown.  In early 
December, the lab notified neighbors of a small tritium release,
well below regulatory standards, into Indian Creek.  Pumping from
the NuMI tunnel brings tritiated water to the surface, protecting
the underlying aquifer. Fermilab has taken measures to bring 
Indian Creek back to a level so low that it cannot be detected. 

<p> <h1>
*** ICARUS T1200 canceled
</h1>
A 300 ton liquid Argon detector was tested at Pavia in 2001 (T300)
and ICARUS had planned a physics program based on the 600 ton 
detector and 2 units of 1200 tons (T3000).  After the Borexino 
accident, all Argon activities were suspended till Sep 04.  T600
will proceed with installation in March 2006.  Major orders on
T1200.1 have been canceled and T1200.2 is postponed.  INFN had 
proposed 20M euro for 85% of T1200 for CNGS2, but now ICARUS is
unable to fulfill the deliverables.  T600 may continue as an
INFN supported technical tool for advance tests.

*** First neutrino seminar at Olin, new engineering college
</h1>
What would you do with $464M?  In a December 20 Wall Street 
Journal Article, the new Olin Engineering College is described.
That college had its first seminar on neutrinos in November.  One
of many things that makes OLIN unique is that 2/3 of the physics 
faculty is currently pregnant.

*** NOW2006 Neutrino Oscillation Workshop in Italy 9-16 September
</h1>
The workshop will be held in the Grand Hotel Daniela at Conca 
Specchiulla (Otranto, Lecce, Italy), a wonderful resort facing the 
Adriatic sea, from 9 to 16 September 2006. Because of limitations 
in accommodation and to fulfill the workshop requirements, 
participation is by invitation only, and will be limited to ~ 150.

*** Neutrino jobs page
</h1>
Two former MINOS students recently expressed appreciation for the 
neutrino jobs page: 
<a href="http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/jobs/jobs.htm"> 
http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/jobs/jobs.htm
</a>
Input when jobs are available and when filled is appreciated.
