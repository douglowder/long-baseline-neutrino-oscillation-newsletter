Long-Baseline news, October 2002</h1>

<h1>
*** Muon neutrino - 1/4 nu1, 1/4 nu2, 1/2 nu3</h1>
Back in the days of bimaximal mixing (not SO long ago), we wrote that numu
was 1/4 nu1, 1/4 nu2 and 1/2 nu3. We now think this isn't quite right,
and we're learning the fractions better. If KaMLAND confirms the LMA (on
11/9 or later), we'll continue to measure the MNS matrix even better. But
it gave the Nobel prize committee an idea.
<h1>
*** Nobel Prize - 1/4 for Davis, 1/4 Koshiba, 1/2 someone else</h1>
The prizes for neutrino astronomy this year (and not oscillations) was
food for many lunch table conversations. One theory is that this leaves
room for a prize for oscillations. Another theory is that this was meant
to be remembered as the prize for oscillations, even though it wasn't.
<h1>
*** Nobel prize for Neutrino Theory?</h1>
The New York Times stated, "No matter how worthy the winners, the selection
process is inherently unjust." It mentioned that the citation left out
John Bahcall, Vladimir Gribov, Bruno Pontecorvo, Stanislav Mikheyev, Alexei
Smirnov and Lincoln Wolfenstein. Folklore states that mixed experiment/theory
prizes are rare. Pontecorvo and Gribov have passed away hence ineligible.
<h1>
*** BooNE Prize for Neutrino Theorist Kayser</h1>
Boris Kayser won the unprestigious BooNE prize, awarded for most closely
guessing the number of phototubes in their 1st nu event. MiNIBoone already
has more neutrino events than LSND. But the p intensity &amp; hence the
event rates are lower than planned because of Booster losses, which should
be reduced soon.
<h1>
*** 2002 Cultural Prize for Totsuka</h1>
Yoji Totsuka, leader of the Super-Kamiokande collaboration which showed
conclusive evidence for neutrino oscillations, won the 2002 Cultural Prize.

<h1>
*** New Detectors in the NuMI Beam</h1>
An extensive study on detectors for future neutrino experiments in the
NuMI Beam will be presented to the Fermilab PAC. Some detector R&amp;D
would be useful for RPC's, phototubes and Liquid Argon. <a href="http://www.hep.anl.gov/mcg/detrd/detectrd.pdf">http://www.hep.anl.gov/mcg/detrd/detectrd.pdf</a>
<h1>
*** Neutrino Scattering in the NuMI Beam</h1>
An EOI signed by 17 institutions is thinking of high precision neutrino
studies in the near detector region of the high intensity NuMI beam at
Fermilab. Neutrino cross sections, nuclear effects, and a wide variety
of other particle and nuclear physics topics could be addressed. <a href="http://home.fnal.gov/~morfin/midis/midis_eoi.pdf">http://home.fnal.gov/~morfin/midis/midis_eoi.pdf</a>
<h1>
*** An Off-axis Near Detector in the NuMI Beam</h1>
A group from Rochester has expressed interest in a new off-axis near detector
to measure cross sections in anticipation of a future off-axis far detector.

<h1>
*** DISASTRO ECOLOGICO AL GRAN SASSO</h1>
Well, probably not. In August Borexino spilled about 50 liters of their
1250 tons of pseudocumene, and people in a nearby village claimed they
could smell it. After a web search, the only reference was on a bulletin
board for anarchists.
<h1>
*** Neutrino Homework</h1>
Assume Majorana nus. A left-handed numu beam interacts with a target producing
negative muons. The same experiment is observed by an observer moving faster
than the nus. In this reference frame they are right-handed. They are,
therefore, called antineutrinos by the observer and their CC interactions
are expected to yield positive muons. Sign of the electric charge is a
Lorentz invariant, hence both observers must observe the same sign, and
the negative sign is the answer. How does the moving observer explain this?
Does it prove that nus cannot be Majorana?
<h1>
*** Neutrino Folksong</h1>
A graduate of the Colorado school of mines wrote the following "Dark as
a Dungeon" to the tune of an unrecognized folk song:
<br><font color="#3333FF">Come all you bright students so young and so
fine</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">and seek not your fortune way down in the mine.</font>
<br>I<font color="#3333FF">t will form as a habit, it will seep through
your life</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">and hunting neutrinos causes nothing but strife.</font>
<br><font color="#CC0000">(Chorus) For it's dark as a dungeon, damp as
the dew</font>
<br><font color="#CC0000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
where the neutrinos come slowly and the funding does too</font>
<br><font color="#CC0000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
where it takes years to tell if the sun really shines</font>
<br><font color="#CC0000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
it's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine.</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">There's many a man I've known in my day</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">who lived just to labor their whole life away</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">like a fiend with his dope, like a drunkard with
his wine</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">a physicist can lust for the lure of the mine.</font>
<br><font color="#CC0000">(Chorus)</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">When the textbooks are written and the ages do
pass</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">the men in the mines proved neutrinos have mass</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">and though we twisted and strained with all of
our might</font>
<br><font color="#3333FF">when it comes to the sun, well Bahcall got it
right.</font>
<br><font color="#FF0000">(Chorus)</font>
