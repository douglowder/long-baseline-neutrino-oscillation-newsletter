*** Clinton links neutrino mass to SSC
</h1>
<a href="http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/clinton.html">
President Clinton's remarks to MIT graduates </a>
this June included:
"Just yesterday in Japan, physicists announced a discovery that
tiny neutrinos have mass.  Now, that may not mean much to most
Americans, but it may change our most fundamental theories --
from the nature of the smallest subatomic particles to how the
universe itself works, and indeed how it expands.  This discovery
was made, in Japan, yes, but it had the support of the investment
of the U.S. Department of Energy.  This discovery calls into
question the decision made in Washington a couple of years ago to
disband the super-conducting supercollider, and it reaffirms the
importance of the work now being done at the Fermi National
Acceleration Facility in Illinois."

*** The Universe May Never Be the Same
</h1>Neutrinos are in the News all over.  A front page story from the
Chicago Tribune shows Bob Bernstein looking out of the NuMI stub.

*** MiniBoone Approved at Fermilab
</h1>The BooNE experiment has received Stage I approval at Fermilab.
From Neutrino 98 and WEIN Conferences, there are now three results
with an excess:  LSND DAR (33.9 +/-8.0 events), LSND DIF (18.1 +/-
6.6 events) and Karmen I (7.3 +/- 7 events), and one experiment
which sees less than its expected background:  Karmen II (3
background events expected + 1.6 +/- 0.8 events expected based on
LSND DAR and 0 seen).  Phase I of BooNE (MiniBooNE) expects ~1000
events (a 10 sigma signal) if the LSND signal is numu -&gt; nue, and
thus will make a decisive statement either proving or ruling it
out.  They need about 3.5$M funds.  Plans are to run early 2001.

*** Do new KARMEN limits push LSND effect? Showdown in Santa Fe.
</h1>There were heated discussions at WEIN '98 whether the new Karmen
data "rules out" the LSND effect.  As shown in "latest results"
at <a href="http://www-ik1.fzk.de/www/karmen/karmen_e.html">
www-ik1.fzk.de/www/karmen/karmen_e.html, </a> the high delta m^2
limit from Karmen is 1.3 10^-3 for data through April '98 using
the unified approach of Cousins and Feldman (though their
sensitivity is 5.4 10^-3).

<p> </p><h1>
*** Tau neutrino candidate in DONUT
</h1>A good tau neutrino candidate has been reported by the DONUT
experiment, the emulsion experiment searching for the direct
observation of nutaus from taus from Ds decay in a beam dump at
Fermilab.  It has a decay after 4.5 mm in the ECC target.  Three
nutau candidates among the first 34 neutrino candidates is
consistent with the expected rate.

<p> </p><h1>
*** New CHORUS and NOMAD limits
</h1>
<a href="http://choruswww.cern.ch/welcome.html">
Chorus </a> has analysed their 1 mu events from 94-96 and their 0mu
events from 94-95.  They have located 91,834 events so far.
For large dmsq at 90% CL, their limit on the mixing angle
is 1.3 10^-3.  Their ultimate sensitivity when they are done
scanning is 2 10^-4.  For large dmsq at 90%CL,
<a href="http://nomadinfo.cern.ch/">
NOMAD's </a> new
limit on the mixing angle is 2.2 10^-3.  This includes a
partial analysis of their 1995-1997 data.

*** "Neutrino Oscillation Industry Page" feted
</h1>June 12 1998 Science named the Neutrino Oscillation Industry
web page
<a href="http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/nu_industry.html">
www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/nu_industry.html, </a> a
"Hot Pick" for its information on neutrino hunting.

*** Neutrino shine during an eclipse?
</h1>If neutrinos decay to visible light, the center of the sun would
shine during a solar eclipse.  A team looked in February from
Venezuela, and didn't see, as reported in
<a href="www.cern.ch/CERN/Courier/1998/E4.html">
May's CERN Courier. </a>

*** SNO survives earthquake
</h1>Last month a drift collapsed in the Sudbury mine.  No one was
hurt, but the noise could be heard in Sudbury and registered
3.9 on the Richter scale.  The detector was engineered to
withstand 4.5 and held up with no problems at all.

<p> </p><h1>
*** First leg of Japanese Hadron Facility funded
</h1>Recently, the Japanese Government decided to provide an additional
fund to supplement the JFY98 budget (starting 1 Apr 98).  It
includes construction of a high-intensity 60 MeV Linac.  Note
that the <a href="http://http://www-jhf.kek.jp/">
JHF </a> accelerator consists of 200 MeV Linac, 3 GeV
synchrotron and 50 GeV synchrotron.  This does not necessarily
mean approval of the entire JHF project.  But it's a good start.

*** Muon Collider Workshop
</h1>There will be a 1 day workshop on "The Potential for Neutrino
Physics at Future Muon Colliders at Brookhaven August 14th.
