*** GLOBES released, an Herculean task (or maybe ATLAS?)
</h1>
The Munich (TUM) group has released
A General Long-Baseline Experiment Simulator (GLoBES).

*** WIN05 in Delphi Greece June 2005
</h1>
The Weak Interactions and Neutrino Workshop will be June 6-11.
The oracle of Apollo at Delphi offered inspiration and guidance 
to all who sought his aid.  Let's ask the value of theta_13?

<p> <h1>
*** MINOS getting closer
</h1>
The MINOS experiment has been taking cosmic ray data with its far 
detector & is in the process of completing its near detector 
and (NuMI) beam line.  The experiment showed 37 contained and 48 
throughgoing nu induced events at Neutrino 2004, and hopes to 
measure the charge ratio soon.  With atmospheric muons, there is 
a sharp moon shadow.  Near detector installation has 260/280 
planes installed, and will be done during the Olympics.  The Main 
Injector has run with 6 batches and 2.7 10**13 ppp.  

<p> <h1>
*** THESEUS dies again
</h1>
THE Second Experiment Underground at Soudan, aka Soudan 2, was an 
early player in the long-baseline neutrino planning process.  
MINOS recently considered again the costs, merit and manpower 
requirements for running this 1 kiloton fine-grained calorimeter 
in the NuMI beam.  Having decided no, modules are being scrapped.

<p> <h1>
*** ADONIS new for supernovae
</h1>
A new collaboration is considering a supernova experiment using 
lead and scintillator, A Detector Of NeutrInos from Supernovae.
Proposed: 6x6x6 m**3, 466 ton lead, 81% fiducial volume for 
supernova nus.  The signal will be nu-e CC and neutron(s) from NC. 
Previously only nuebars have been seen from Supernovae.
  
<p> <h1>
*** ICARUS
</h1>
This 600 ton liquid argon experiment to be installed in the Gran 
Sasso is part of the Cern Neutrinos to Gran Sasso (CNGS) program and 
also called CNGS2.  27,000 cosmic ray triggers were collected during 
an 01 run.  At the LNGS Director's mandate, a working group reviewed 
cryogenics, safety, installation, commissioning & operation of T600 
in the lab along with a risk analysis of possible failures.  They 
recommended improvements to the cryogenics and concluded the overall 
risk linked to LNGS activities will not increase when T600 becomes 
operational.  The schedule is a dry test 9/04 and filling 10/05.

<p> <h1>
*** Athens in MINOS
</h1>
The University of Athens joined MINOS in 1998 (after COSMOS was 
cancelled) and has participated in various MINOS activities:  
4-plane prototype readout and analysis, initial design efforts of 
mu monitoring for the nu beam, testing and characterization of 
Hamamatsu M16 PMTs for the MINOS FAR detector (in collaboration 
with UT Austin), and MINOS FAR detector commissioning. The Athens 
group is currently participating in the commissioning of the MINOS 
NEAR detector, while preparing for physics analysis, an effort
involving developing software for neutrino event classification in 
the MINOS detectors, using Artificial Neural Network techniques.

*** NESTOR
</h1>
The Neutrino Extended Submarine Telescope with Oceanographic 
Research has 745 atmospheric muons at a depth of 3800 m in its 
site near Pylos Greece.  They used one NESTOR star with 12 
optical modules in March 03.  They plan to run 4 floors in 
autumn 2004 and full tower deployment in autumn 2006.

<p> <h1>
*** ANTARES
</h1>
This array of phototubes in the Mediterranean is located near 
Toulon France at a depth of 2500 meters.  A prototype sector line 
with 5 storeys of optical modules operated in 2003, along with a 
Mini Instrumentation Line with various devices to study the 
water.  They recovered the prototype and will redeploy in 2004.
Full detector will be deployed in 2005-2007.  Presently the 
detector design has 10 strings, each 400 m high with 30 storeys 
spaced vertically by 16 m, and 60 m between strings.

<p> <h1>
*** Pylos Meeting
</h1>
XIII International Symposium on Very High Energy Cosmic Ray 
Interactions will be held at the NESTOR Institute in Pylos Greece 
6-12 September 2004.

*** MiniBooNE horn sets world record; then fails
</h1>
After 100,000,000 pulses, MiniBooNE's horn suffered a ground fault 
July 24.  It pulsed an order of magnitude more than any other!  
They may take horn-off data til an available replacement is used.

<p> <h1>
*** Olympics August 13-29; Longbaseline newsletter schedule change
</h1>
To better use a reference resource, longbnews will be on average 2 
days later each month.  The "date" will be the previous month.
