*** Stefan Soldner-Rembold elected DUNE cospokesperson
</H1> <P>
Stefan Soldner-Rembold, professor of particle physics at the
University of Manchester, was elected to a two-year term as
co-spokesperson of DUNE.  He serves with Ed Blucher from the
University of Chicago.  Former spokesperson Mark Thomson will now
serve as the Executive Chair of the Science and Technology
Facilities Council, an important office in UK Science.

*** Patricia Vahle elected NOvA cospokesperson
</H1> <P>
"Tricia" Vahle, professor of physics from the College of William
and Mary, was elected to a two-year term as spokesperson of the
NOvA experiment.  She serves with Peter Shanahan from Fermilab.
Former co-spokesperson Mark Messier from Indiana University has
been writing meeting agendas as cospokesperson since 2006.

*** Rigged election disrespects  neutrinos
</H1> <P>

</A>
An alleged "subatomic smackdown" had voters choose their favorite
particle between the photon, proton, electron and neutron.  This
may have made sense in the 1950's.  When I was in school first
thinking about particle physics, I'm sure I would have assumed
a fundamental particle is absolutely stable.  Our standard model
has 12 "particles" and an array of force carriers.  But it is
intuitively obvious to the most casual observer, that neutrinos
are the most interesting on any list and should have been on the
ballot.  By the way, the photon "won".

*** Lia Merminga selected to lead Pip II
</H1> <P>
The new project director of Proton Improvement Plan II, Lia
Merminga has worked at SLAC, Jefferson Lab and TRIUMPH.  PIP II
will provide high intensity protons to the DUNE long-baseline
neutrino experiment in South Dakota.

*** Don't walk on the floor with your SOX
</H1> <P>
Dark Matter DM direct detection experiments look for recoils of
nuclei or electrons due to interactions with dark matter
particles.  But neutrino interactions from solar and other
neutrinos provide a background.  In the usual plot of dark
matter cross section versus mass, this provides a "floor" below
which it will be difficult to extract a DM signal.  In 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08146"> arXiv:1803.08146 </A>,
Wyenberg & Shoemaker map that floor for DM-e experiments.

<H1>
*** INFN cancels SOX experiment
</H1> <P>
The SOX (Short-distance nu Oscillations with BoreXino) project was
canceled due to the impossibility of obtaining the required
source.    
<A href="http://home.infn.it/en/media-outreach/press-releases/">  
http://home.infn.it/en/media-outreach/press-releases/
</A>
The plan had been to obtain a Cerium source from Russia and look
for oscillations in Borexino with a wavelength possibly suggested
by the short-baseline anomalies.  But the Russian source provider,
Mayak Production Association, reported that it will not be able to
deliver the source, and INFN reluctantly canceled the project.

<H1>
*** Isotope cloud due to SOX?
</H1> <P>
Science magazine reported speculation that a low-level isotope
cloud of ruthenium-106 may have been associated with the attempt
to make the source for SOX.  But the Russian company denies the
report.  See

<H1>
*** CERN emails
</H1> <P>
Last month, none of the 70 CERN subscribes received this
newsletter.   Some new software didn't like Fermilab's list
server.  They went back to the old software, warning me that
this would happen again.  If you want to see last month's
issue (or any of them), click on the link below.

*** Pontecorvo prize for Fogli and Lisi
</H1> <P>
Gianluigi Fogli and Eligio Lisi (from INFN, Bari) have won the
2017 Pontecorvo Prize for their work on global fits to neutrino
oscillation data. Global fits have, among other things, been
responsible for early indications of the large mixing angle
solution to the solar neutrino problem, and a non-zero value for
theta_13.

The idea for a near-sun orbit solar neutrino spacecraft has
received NASA funding for a Technical Study.
