</p><h1>Fermilab Technical Neutrino Review</h1>
On June 9-10 a committee reviewed four proposed
neutrino experiments at Fermilab, P803, P822, P860 and
P872.   A report was written and presumably discussed
by the PAC at Aspen last week.  The report hasn't been
made available to us yet, but some things were clear
from the discussions at the review and in hallway
conversations since then.   The committee seemed
disappointed in 822 that a more thorough design and
proposal for a cavity filler wasn't presented.
On the bright side, many of them seemed enthusiastic
about the physics prospects and goals for the long
baseline part of the program.  One possibility that
has been mentioned was for Fermilab to issue a call
for proposals for long baseline experiments.

At the two day meeting, a number of issues about neutrino
oscillation physics were discussed.  There were very nice
presentations on Chorus, NOMAD, LSND, Sudbury and BNL889.
Transparencies are available.

</p><h1> Calgary Workshop on Atmospheric Neutrinos?</h1>
There will be a short workshop on atmospheric neutrinos
at the Calgary Cosmic Ray conference on Wednesday July
21st at 7 pm.   If there is enough interest, there will
be a proceedings.   For further information, contact
Maury Goodman.

<h1>FERMILAB User's meeting</h1>
The neutrino program was again prominently mentioned as
part of Fermilab's future this year.  Lab Director John
Peoples said, among other things, "The Main Injector is
almost approved," and "In the next year we'll decide on
what kind of neutrino program to have.  It will be a
while before we're able to spend money on it."

<h1> Sad note.</h1>
Michael Gormley from Fermilab, who was active in 860
proposal, passed away this week.

<h1> Beam energy distributions</h1>
Anthony Malensek has produced NUADA calculations for the
near beam and far beam energy distributions.  While the
near beam's energy profile is very radius dependent, the
inner 25 cm of the beam matches the far beam at all
energies to a few percent.
