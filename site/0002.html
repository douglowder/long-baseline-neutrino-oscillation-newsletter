<p> </p><h1>
*** NuMI notice to proceed (or the FNAL/Gran Sasso connection)
</h1>The DOE announced that it has awarded a $30.5 million contract to
S.A. Healy Co. to build the tunnel for NuMI.  Construction of the
NuMI tunnels and halls, including the decay pipe and the area for
the MINOS near detector, will take about 18 months.  The parent
company of Healy is an Italian firm which worked at Gran Sasso.

<p> </p><h1>
*** The MINOS/SNO connection
</h1>The construction of the MINOS cavity at Soudan is proceeding,
with a large drilling machine which is making the holes for the
explosives.  The  machine was brought from Sudbury, Canada.  One
delay was caused when the crew couldn't find any metric bolts.

<p> </p><h1>
*** NEMO contract
</h1>A Contract for a Conceptual and Feasibility Study of a Deep-sea
Astrophysical Neutrino Observatory, called NEMO (NEutrino
Mediterranean Observatory), has been awarded to Sasp Offshore
Engineering, Sonsub International and Saipem (ENI Group) by INFN.
The Observatory will consist of ~104 optical sensors 3500 m deep.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Not enough adjectives
</h1>Amid a "historic science and technology budget" for FY01, the DOE
line item budget for NuMI is adequate for the beam, but the
detector budget is falling behind.  The president's budget for
FY01 cut the MINOS detector from $15M to $10M, but FNAL quickly
determined that this was a mistake.  NuMI management claims there
are not enough adjectives in the English language to describe
their reaction to the proposed FY01 budget.

<p> </p><h1>
*** UuNnO pronounced uno
</h1>A meeting at Irvine in February considered the construction of
a 60 x 60 x 180 m^3 650 kton water cerenkov counter, the Ultra
underground (or underwater) Nucleon decay and neutrino
Observatory.  Capabilities for nucleon decay, solar nus, super-
nova nus, atmospheric nus and nu-factory targets were considered.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Super-K solar neutrinos waiting for Neutrino 2000
</h1>Super-K decided not to update its results on solar neutrinos
every 6 months.  824 day numbers have been shown publicly, but
won't be updated till a group meeting about 10 days before
Neutrino 2000.  One change in solar neutrino analysis is in the
day/night effect, which was previously shown in 10 equal bins
(5 day, 5 night).  Bin N5 has now been changed to correspond to
the core only.  They are not seeing an enhancement in N5 only,
but D-N/D+N is 1.8 sigma for 824 days.  They are making progress
in lowering the threshold.  They are 95% efficient at 4.5 MeV
and will soon show data down to 5.0 MeV and should go below.

<p> </p><h1>
*** SNO goes SuperNova while waiting for Neutrino 2000
</h1>SNO will wait for Neutrino 2000 to show its real results.  They
have some rate of flashing phototubes, which are easy to
eliminate in offline analysis, but whose rates appear correlated
to seismic activity.  One physicist dropped a wrench on the
outside platform and set off the supernova trigger.

<p> </p><h1>
*** K2K rates
</h1>K2K now expects to get 10^20 protons on target in 5 years rather
than the earlier hoped for 3 years.  So far they have about 1.5
10^19 pot.  The neutrino event rate in the 3 near detectors is
Data/MC ~ .84+-.01 in 3 detectors.  Their far event rate is 3
contained fidvol events, expecting 12.3 +-1.8 (no osc).  They
also have 3 outside fidvol, expecting 5.5+-1.2; 2 events in the
outer detector (crossing) expecting 4.2+-1.6 and 4 events
contained in the OD, expecting 8.7+-3.3.  They put 5.4 10^12 ppp
on the target and expect a short term 5% increase.  The pulse-to-
pulse beam pointing is good to +-.5 mrad, probably dominated by
small targeting errors on the current carrying target.

<p> </p><h1>
*** HARP experiment at CERN approved
</h1>This PS experiment will study hadron production for understanding
potential muon yield for neutrino factories.  The NA49 beamline
and new apparatus are a possibility.  E_max is 15 GeV/c.

<p> </p><h1>
*** A friend disappears
</h1>We deeply regret to report the death of Roland Barloutaud,
founder and original director of the Frejus laboratory.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrinos on the dark side
</h1>Matter effects change the region of parameter space that is
allowed/excluded in the absence of matter effects for many
experiments.  These effects change depending on the sign of
delta-m squared.  This could be addressed in the sin^2-2 theta --
dm2 plot by folding over the negative solution above mixing of 1.
But it turns out that tan^2 theta is a better variable to plot
than sin^2 2-theta.  This is done in Gouvea et al. (below)

<p> </p><h1>
*** Shrock shocked, Bethe blocked
</h1>At the neutrino factory workshop, Shrock said that he originally
found the high mixing angle needed to explain atmospheric
neutrinos "shocking".  He wasn't alone.  For a long time (still?)
Bethe would only consider small angle MSW solutions.  "Why do you
prefer the small mixing angle solution?" Bethe was asked just 2
years ago.  "Mixing angles are small." he answered.
