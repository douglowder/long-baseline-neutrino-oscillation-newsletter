*** Baby MIND and WAGASCI to reduce uncertainties in T2K
</H1> <P>
The difference in target material between the T2K near
detector (scintillator) and far detector (water) is the largest
systematic uncertainty for oscillation analysis.  A new ND
with a water target (WAGASCI) has been developed.  In order to
measure the momentum and charge of outgoing muons, a magnetized
iron detector (Baby MIND) is also proposed.

*** Tau appearance in Super-K atmospheric neutrinos
</H1> <P>
When Super-K discovered neutrino oscillations in 98, they also had
a consistent 2 sigma excess in tau neutrino appearance.  Burt
Richter didn't understand.  They now report 338.1 +- 72.7 events
of nutau appearance, a 3.3 sigma excess corresponding to a chance
probability of 4.4e-4.  This is 5326 days of SK-I to SK-IV.

*** Neutrino covfefe** in the U.S.
</H1> <P>
The first step in the US budget process is the President's Budget
Request (PBR), which proposes a 17% cut of the DOE Office of Science
for 2018 compared to 2017.  It is 18% for HEP,  For NSF the proposed
cut is 11%, 10% for Math and Physical Sciences.  Changes are
possible, even likely, but some plans are made around these
numbers.  For LBNF/DUNE, there is $55M, $5M more than FY17 and
$29M more than FY16, but below what's needed to stay on schedule.
If enacted, the cuts might drastically reduce NOvA running time.
** you can google the etymology but I'll use this new word to
describe effects on neutrinos from the current U.S. administration.

*** NuMI flux study wins Ph.D. thesis award
</H1> <P>
The winner of the 2017 URA thesis award for was Leonidas Aliaga
Soplin for his work "Neutrino Flux Prediction for the NuMI
Beamline", his 2016 thesis from the College of William & Mary,
available at 
<A href="http://inspirehep.net/record/1450751/">  
http://inspirehep.net/record/1450751/  
</A>
He created a
software tool called Package to Predict the FluX (PPFX).

*** PIP-1+
</H1> <P>
When MINOS was proposed, the proton intensity of the FNAL Main
Injector was projected to be 3.7e20 protons per year, though it
took several years to reach that value.  The Proton Improvement
Plan (PIP) has now successfully raised that for NOvA to 7e20.
PIP-1+ is not a project, like PIP-II, but a follow-on to reduce
beam losses and conduct a new shielding assessment, to increase
the rate, along with upgrading the NuMI target to take more
protons per pulse.  The PIP-II vision is 1.2 MW; "PIP-III" 2.4MW.

*** Follow the move of ICARUS across the Atlantic
</H1> <P>
The 760 ton (when full) ICARUS detector, which previously moved from
Gran Sasso in Italy to CERN in Switzerland for upgrades, will soon
begin its transport to Fermilab in the U.S.  You can follow the
journey at

*** LBNF groundbreaking in South Dakota
</H1> <P>
Mark your calendar for 21 July (not to be confused with the
eclipse on 21 August).

<H1>
*** First neutrinos in the Fermilab muon area
</H1> <P>
The first beam has been injected into the Fermilab g-2 ring.
Nobody has measured neutrinos from muon decay, but we know they
are there.  The g-2 physics run should start by calendar 2018.
