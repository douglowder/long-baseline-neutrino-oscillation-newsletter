*** J-PARC/T2K to restart after minor radiation leak
</h1> <p>
After a seven month shutdown, J-PARC has written several reports
on safety and plans for how to avoid a reoccurrence of a similar
accident.  The governor of Ibaraki Prefecture has agreed with a
plan to restart operations.  Beam for the T2K long-baseline nu
experiment may start in April, but budget cuts reduce 2014 beam.

*** Gerda joint fit further rules out alleged 0nu2Beta signal
</h1> <p>
Having ruled out Klapdor's alleged signal at 1.25 10^25 y, Gerda
has combined its data (4 strings with 21.6 kg-yr) with IGEX and
HdM, to further limit T &gt; 3.0 10^25 y in Ge.  They plan 100 kg-y
with more Ge, better Pulse shape discrimination, cleaner material
in the cables and holders, and to instrument the liquid Ar shield
to veto cosmics.  2 nu lifetime is 1.84 +.14=-10 10^21 y.  The
background model is in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5084"> arXiv:1306.5084 </a>
(&amp; <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0562"> arXiv:1312.0562 </a>).
In Xenon, EXO has
3.5 times their reported data from April 2012, and is working on
nEXO, to cover the inverted hierarchy, in the SNOLAB cryopit.

*** Next 0nu2Beta experiments before new NSAC subcommittee
</h1> <p>
A standing NSAC subcommittee has been appointed to provide DOE &amp;
NSF guidance.  It is chaired by Bob McKeown.  The longest sentence
of the charge requests that they assess the science-driven
down-select criteria for arriving at the most promising approach
to a second generation experiment, including a sensitivity
goal that at a high level of confidence, based on present
understanding, would be expected to answer the question of the
Majorana vs. Dirac nature of neutrino for the inverted mass
hierarchy scenario when combined with the results from other
experiments that aim at establishing the hierarchy and masses of
the three known neutrino flavors.  First report is due April 2014.

*** MicroBooNE installs Time Projection Chamber in cryostat

The cryostat will be moved from D0 into the Fermilab Booster
Neutrino Beam, filled with Liquid Argon, and help determine if
the MiniBooNE low energy excess was due to photons or electrons.

*** ICFA neutrino panel meets in Europe
</h1> <p>
In January the ICFA neutrino panel met in Paris and discussed the
current state of neutrinos and ideas for European facilities. They
included NuSTORM at CERN, LBNO, ESSnuSB at the European Spallation
Source, involvement in LBNE in the US and Hyper-K in Japan,and
WA-104 and 105 as part of the CERN Neutrino Facility CENF.

*** ICFA neutrino panel meets in the Americas
</h1> <p>
In January the ICFA neutrino panel met at Fermilab and discussed
neutrinos again, along with accelerator R&amp;D, Detector R&amp;D, MAP &amp;
hadroproduction.  LBNE was taken as a given.  A session focused
on international cooperation for previous and future programs.

*** ICFA neutrino panel at the end of the beginning
</h1> <p>
Mimicking Winston Churchill, Ken Long said the neutrino panel was
at the end of the beginning.   They will write a short report on
its three international workshops, and then engage with Lab Directors
and Funding Agencies to refine its understanding of the factors
that influence the development of an optimal scenario.  Then a
second report will be followed by a third year of community and
stakeholder consultation while preparing a final report to ICFA.

*** NOvA nearing end of far and near detector construction
</h1> <p>
The last NOvA module has been strung at Minnesota for the (FD) far
detector in Ash River, and the final block of the near detector is
also in place.   Watch a 7 min. video on the FD construction
before it is old news.

</a>
Meanwhile physicists are actively searching for the first FD nu(s)
in the instrumented part, currently running in the NuMI beam.
It's a narrow band beam tuned to the first oscillation maximum
and below nu-tau CC threshold, so many nus have oscillated away!

*** Fermilab PAC considers several Neutrino proposals

The Fermilab Program Advisory Committee advises the Director on
the experimental program. In particular, the committee reviews
proposals for new experiments at Fermilab, gives advice to the
Director about the optimization of the ongoing experimental
program, and about plans for the future program.  In January it
heard updates from NOvA, MINERvA, LBNE and MicroBooNE and proposals
for MiniBooNE+, LAr1-ND (Testing Neutrino Anomalies with Multiple
Argon Detectors at Fermilab), CHIPS (CHerenkov detectors in mine
PitS along the NuMI beam), and ICARUS (moving it to Fermilab).
