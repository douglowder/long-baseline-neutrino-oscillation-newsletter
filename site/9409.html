*** Long Baseline Collaboration Meeting Oct 1-2 </h1><p>
58 people attended the second LBC meeting at Fermilab.  Working
groups on beams, detector R&amp;D, and physics/simulations met and
reported on progress.  A structural issues group proposed
organizational guidelines for the collaboration.

</p><p>
</p><h1>
*** Stan Wojcicki interim spokesman</h1><p>
The Structural Issues Committee, chaired by Dick Heinz, met and
proposed a set of rules for choosing the spokesman, and setting
up an institutional committee for the Fermilab Long Baseline
Collaboration.  The interim steering committee chose Stan
Wojcicki to act as spokesman for now.  A spokesman search
committee chaired by Tom Fields was established.  They seek
suggestions both about candidates and what the important
qualifications should be.   Membership by institutions in the
Long Baseline Collaboration is open between now and the
submission of the LOI (January 1995), after which new groups
may be accepted by vote of the institutional board.

</p><h1>
*** Next Meetings 3-4 December; Long Baseline week 9-13 Jan 1995
</h1><p>
The next LBC meeting is scheduled for Saturday/Sunday 3-4
December.  There are also plans for a week-long working meeting
during the week of 9-13 January in preparation for the
submission of the LOI.  Both meetings will be at Fermilab.
Several working group meetings and steering are also scheduled,
and plan to make use of video-conferencing.

*** Site visits to Soudan, IMB
</h1>
Representatives of the site committee visited Soudan in August
and October, and visited IMB in September.  The damage from the
IMB leak was apparent, but there was the attractive possibility
of a new laboratory for the Long Baseline detector.  At the
October meeting, the collaboration agreed to make a site
decision quickly enough to take advantage of opportunities to
reduce beam costs as part of the Main Injector project.

</p><h1>
*** BNL to narrow Long Baseline choices; then shoot-out with FNAL
</h1>
Within about one month from the arrival of Tom Kirk, Brookhaven
will narrow its long baseline options to one.  Options under
consideration include the original 889 plan for 20 km, a newer
idea to put a water Cerenkov detector on Plum Island (60 km),
and the idea to put a spark chamber detector in Conn (100 km).
At the November HEPAP meeting in SLAC, it is expected that a
review panel to evaluate neutrino physics opportunities in the
United States will be appointed, and would meet in 2 to 6 months.

<p>
</p><h1>
*** IMB tubes
</h1>1600 IMB tubes are being refurbished for use in the
Superkamiokande shield.  The water pressure in Super-K is 4
times what is was for IMB, so new housings and back plates are
being installed.  400 IMB tubes being tested at the KEK
calibration beam will be sent back to the US for refurbishing
when the test run is over in October.

*** NuMI area on 7th floor; Jenny Thomas, Tim Toohig added
</h1>
Desk space for visiting Short Baseline and Long Baseline
experimenters has been designated on the 7th floor of the high
rise (former SDC area).  Phones and terminals will be added.
NuMI project manager Gina Rameika has appointed Jenny Thomas to
coordinate the experiments (short baseline and long baseline)
and Tim Toohig for civil construction issues

<p>
</p><h1>
*** UK Long Baseline Meeting October 19th for interested parties
</h1>
A meeting will be held at Oxford for any British (or other)
experimenters who are interested in finding out more about the
Long Baseline Experiment and opportunities to collaborate.

</p><h1>
*** NuMI note system established
</h1>
There are 27 NuMI notes from the beginning of 1994, including
topics on Long Baseline, Short Baseline, and Beam issues.  Any
institution on a NuMI experiment is entitled to a full set of
NuMI notes. Anyone may request an index. (Contact Maury Goodman)
