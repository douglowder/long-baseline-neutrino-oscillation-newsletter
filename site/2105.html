*** FNAL's MicroBooNE finishes beam run
</H1> <P>
The MicroBooNE experiment at Fermilab has concluded its beam run
and is analyzing its data to better understand MiniBooNE's low-E
excess in the Booster beam and if it's due to e's or gammas.
The detector is still operating and collecting specialized data.
R&D includes collecting scintillation light in new ways, making
grounding measurements, & raising the drift HV.  Some studies are
due to requests from SBN & DUNE.  No additional nu data will be
proposed, unless repeat measurements seem needed after unblinding.

"The Secretary shall ensure that (LBNF) will provide, at minimum:
(i) A neutrino beam with wideband capability of 1.2 megawatts (MW)
of power and upgradable to 2.4 MW, (ii) 3 caverns excavated for a
70 kiloton fiducial detector mass and supporting surface buildings
and utilities. (iii) Cryogenic systems to support nu detectors,"
starting before 31 Dec 2031 and budgets for FY2022-2026 of $200M,
$325M, $400M, $375M and $250M.

 Topical Group conveners will
resume regular meetings 24 June.  The Neutrino Frontier meeting 
dates are set: 16-18 March 2022, hosted by ORNL.  Initial plans
are for a virtual meeting.  The pan-Snowmass white paper deadline
is 15 March 2022.   Regular NF-community-wide (virtual) meetings
are planned to resume later in summer of 2021.  You can submit
information about planned neutrino frontier white papers at:

*** Neutrino memory
</H1> <P>
General Relativity predicts that the passage of matter/radiation
from an asymmetrically-emitting source should cause a permanent
change in the local space-time metric. This phenomenon, called the
"gravitational memory effect", hasn't been observed, but supernova
nus are a promising avenue for its future detection.   New gravity
wave detectors (DECIGO & BBO) will be sensitive to neutrino memory
for supernovae at typical distances in our galaxy and beyond.

*** Secrets of Universe safe after alleged Security breach
</H1> <P>
A group of "ethical hackers" pointed out that they could see data
at Fermilab.  "The server exposed configuration data for one of
Fermilabâ€™s experiments called 'NOvA' which concerns studying the
purpose of nus in the evolution of the cosmos."  No sensitive data
was breached, but Fermilab implemented new security measures, such
as preventing me from seeing several monitoring pages for a few
hours during my NOvA shift, and making it difficult for people to
upload talks for a DUNE meeting.  So the Universe is safe again.

Scattering & Production Measurements for Improved Beam Simulation"  
An upgraded EMPHATIC device, in FNAL's test beam, could measure
hadron yields and reduce uncertainties in the calculation of nu
fluxes by a factor of 2.  It will combine thin target measurements
with those using a replica NuMI target & spare NuMI focusing horn.
