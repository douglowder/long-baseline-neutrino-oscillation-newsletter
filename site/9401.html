<p>
</p><h1>Long Baseline/822 meeting</h1>
A meeting of the 822 collaboration to discuss long baseline
options at Fermilab will be held Sunday February 20th at
Fermilab.  An agenda will be sent out soon.  Not every
recipient of Long Baseline News will get the agenda and
further notices about the meeting.  Let me know if you
want to be on that list also.
<p>
</p><h1>HEPAP presentation</h1>
Al Mann spoke at the January HEPAP meeting describing BNL 889
and emphasized that the experiment will roughly duplicate the
neutrino energy and path length of the Kamioka experiment, so
it should be able to see the effect well if it is due to
oscillations.  He mentioned ICARUS and P822.  Mel Schwartz
chimed in that the BNL experiment was much cheaper.

</p><h1>Snowmass Neutrino Oscillation Working Group</h1>
At the Snowmass meeting on non-accelerator physics, a working
group on Neutrino Oscillations is being organized
by Bill Reay and Lincoln Wolfenstein.  Dates of Snowmass are
June 29 to July 14th.  An active subgroup is being organized to
concentrate on long baseline motivation (i.e. atmo nus) &amp;
opportunies (BNL889, FNAL822, CERN...) and follow up on the 1991
long baseline workshop.  Anyone interested in the subgroup
should contact Maury Goodman.
<p>
</p><h1>DPF Neutrino</h1>
A panel on neutrino physics is included in the effort on future
HEP that the DPF is conducting since the SSC went away.  The
convenors are Gina Rameika, Hamish Robertson, and Paul Langacker.
At a meeting of convenors, they discussed the progress of the
groups working in two parts.  First each group will study their
physics potential individually over the spring and summer.  In that
time period, the (separate) Drell report is due to HEPAP/DOE.  Then
the DPF will try to grapple with priorities, if they haven't
been decided already by congress, etc.
<p>
</p><h1>Systematic effects</h1>
Peter Litchfield, Hugh Gallagher, Bob Blair and Maury Goodman are
concentrating analysis efforts on understanding NC/CC systematic
errors beyond the level that is required for the statistics that
P822 could ever hope to get.  The key areas where progress has
been made are electron neutrinos, charm cross sections,
misidentification differences near/far, and low E cross section
uncertainties.
<p>
</p><h1>E803 drops Main Ring option; Fermilab Beam design progress</h1>
The option of running E-803 with the main ring has been dropped.
Three options are now being considered:  A.  Beam to Soudan,
revision 1 for a higher level;  B.  Proton West;  with many
questions about switchyard and the high intensities; C. Surface
beam only, with extraction at MI-40 (where the beam to Cleveland
was.)  A key outcome will be the difference between A. and C.,
which is the incremental cost of going deep.
<p>
</p><h1>Main Injector progress</h1>
The rumors are that the Main Injector will get $43M in the 94-95
budget.  The president's budget isn't out yet, and it still has
to go through congress, but the rumor includes that all powers
that be have agreed to this figure, which didn't happen before.
The contracts are about 1/3rd out (when options are exercised)
and 15% under title I estimates, plus contingencies &amp; reserve.
<p>
</p><h1>LVD and atmospheric neutrinos</h1>
With about a third of the full detector in place, LVD
now has about 0.3 kton years of exposure.  Will they make
a contribution on the atmospheric neutrino anomaly?  When they
get their full detector they can clearly measure the numu/nue
ratio at higher energy (above 500 MeV).  This would take
a much larger exposure, however, to compare with the IMB/
Kamioka, etc.
<p>
</p><h1>CHORUS has first few events</h1>
In a run in Nov, CHORUS got their first few neutrino events.
<p>
</p><h1>872 proposal presentation Feb. 11th; Fermilab planning</h1>
A presentation on the proposal to measure nu-tau's from a
beam dump is on next week's PAC agenda.  Fermilab is also
conducting a long range plan exercise led by Tom Nash and
others, and the section on neutrino mass physics is being
coordinated by Gina Rameika.
