*** First observation of CNGS beam Neutrinos
</h1>
This was 18 Aug 06 at the OPERA experiment in the Gran Sasso,
using the neutrino beam made at CERN.  There are 31 target planes
each in 2 supermodules, a total of 206336 bricks or 1766 tons.
From August 18 to August 21, they took 3 x 10^17 protons on
target.  This resulted in more than 100 beam correlated events
with a clean time distribution from GPS of about 10 mu-s. Tracking
detectors in OPERA are taking data with practically no dead time.

<p> </p><h1>
*** OPERA next step
</h1>
In addition to the beam events, they have also measured thousands
of cosmic ray muons.  The next step for the OPERA experiment is
to observe neutrino events in the Emulsion Cloud Chamber Bricks.
The information in the emulsion will be used to separate numu
events from nutaus.

His nobel prize is for co-discovering the muon neutrino.
PRL 9, 36 (1962).

He also was the first to calculate how to measure neutrinos
with an accelerator PRL 4, 306(1960).  You need a proton beam, a
target, a gap, some shielding, and a detector!  Maybe a horn.

*** Scoping Study scopes out future nu opportunities
</h1>
Results from the International Scoping Study on Neutrino Factory &amp;
Superbeam was one of the highlights of NuFact06.  The Workshop
endorsed the proposal of the Programme Committee of the ISS to
proceed now to the preparation of complete International Design
Studies for Betabeam, Neutrino factory and Superbeam(s) options.
The final report of the ISS should be available within 2006.  The
next ISS/IDS meeting will be at CERN in February. Most likely
Feb 21-22. It will set ways of the transition from ISS to IDS's.

Fans of large detectors will gather in Seattle 21-23 September for
NNN06 (Workshop on Next generation Nucleon decay and Neutrino
detectors 2006); see

*** Neutrino Detection of SN1987a 20 years ago
</h1>
Anyone who misses the Joint DPF/JPS meeting in Hawaii this fall
<a href="http://www.dpf2006.org/"> http://www.dpf2006.org/
</a>
can head to Hawaii for this meeting on the
20th anniversary of SN1987A - 23-25 Feb 2007.
<a href="http://sn1987a-20th.physics.uci.edu/"> http://sn1987a-20th.physics.uci.edu/
</a>
The conference will
review what we have learned about supernovas in the past 20
years and what could be learned from a future supernova.

*** Nu Meetings; December in Japan; January - India &amp; Hong Kong
</h1>
An International Workshop on Neutrino Masses and Mixings "Toward
Unified Understanding of Quark and Lepton Mass Matrices" will be
held 17-19 Dec at University of Shizuoka, Shizuoka, Japan.  This
and other meetings can be found on the neutrino meetings page
<a href="http://www.neutrinooscillation.org/numeetings.html">
http://www.neutrinooscillation.org/numeetings.html
</a>
which has started listing meetings for 2007.  The WIN meeting
will be 15-20 Jan in Calcutta.  (You say Kolkota, I say Calcutta.)
A Symposium on Nu Physics/Cosmology will be 8-10 Jan in Hong Kong.

*** NuMI swaps target
</h1>
The NuMI target got stuck in the high energy beam position, the
problem probably being a frozen up pillow block.  Putting in the
spare target took about a week.

*** Neutrino Jeopardy
</h1>
We often have the answer and have to work out the question.  An
August 29 answer on the TV show Jeopardy was "This 8-letter
particle named for its lack of charge is being studied by
beaming it 450 miles in .0025 seconds".  (Photo - Jeff Nelson)

*** New Green
</h1>
For people who enjoyed the story about Louie's "old red" (which
is still going strong at 571,000 miles) he has supplemented his
vehicle inventory by buying a tractor.
