Long-Baseline news, June 2003</h1>

<h1>
*** Gran Sasso closed, state of emergency?</h1>
In a series of events difficult to interpret, its a good time to remind
readers that everything in this newsletter should be taken with grains
of salt. There was a spill by Borexino in August 02. This led to a local
investigation, an alleged 10,000 page report and the closure of Hall C.
A concern was identified to be the water-tightness of the drainage system,
connected to the aquifer. All use of liquids (pseudocumene,...) was halted
as a precaution.

</a>Now a state of emergency has been declared on June 27th by the President
of the Council of Ministers.

</a>The Infn expressed satisfaction for the government decision, urged
by the Institute and decided on June 25th as a consequence of the official
request by the Abruzzo Region. The radical and prompt intervention established
by the decree is an essential step toward the restarting of all the activities
at the Gran Sasso Labs, in a trustful atmosphere with the citizens.
<h1>
*** Opera restarted</h1>
On June 17th, the Competent Court of Teramo has partially accepted the
requests of Infn, allowing the restart of preparations of the Opera experiment.
OPERA and ICARUS are long-baseline neutrino experiments planned at Gran
Sasso from CERN.
<h1>
*** Homestake chosen for NUSEL</h1>
A geotechnical review panel for the NSF identified Homestake as "by far
the most favorable site" for an underground lab in the US (over San Jacinto)
with Soudan a possible back-up. A letter from the NSF Director of Physics
Dehmer stated, "Nor does this determination suggest a probable successful
funding decision following the outcome of further planning activities.
Rather, this determination simply allows the science community and other
interested parties to focus their planning and proposal efforts on the
Homestake site." But Barrick turned off the pumps anyway, despite concerns
about how this affects potential geomicrobiology.
<h1>
*** NUSEL situation fluid, collaboration suspends efforts</h1>
The NUSEL collaboration reported June 18th the suggestion that its name
is the National Underwater Science and Engineering Lab. The water is at
1.5 ft in the 8000 ft level, and slowly rising. It is estimated up to 2
years before it reaches the 7400' level. The executive committee of the
National Underground Science and Engineering Lab issued a press release
"Scientists Announce Intent to Suspend NUSEL-Homestake Efforts. An Open
Letter to Our S.D. Friends". <a href="http://mocha.phys.washington.edu/NUSEL/release.html">http://mocha.phys.washington.edu/NUSEL/release.html</a>
<h1>
*** MANET</h1>
Now that MINOS has installed its last plane, much "graffiti" painted on
earlier planes has been covered up. That won't be the case with this plane,
so a committee has been appointed. It's the "MINOS Art Nomination Evaluation
Team" whose job is to sort through a hopefully large number of ideas for
that last plane.
<h1>
*** MINERVA</h1>
Minerva is the Roman version of Athena, but so far there is one Greek group
among the 19 institutions on Minerva which just had its second collaboration
meeting, and no Italians. Their physics topics include elastic scattering,
the resonance region, nuclear effects &amp; the transition region to deep
inelastic scattering. Planning is for an on-axis detector made from solid
scintillator approximately (2-3)m x (2-3)m x 2m. 8 of the groups are from
nuclear physics. Their FNAL proposal will be submitted this fall.
<h1>
*** Orbach's 20 year strategic plan</h1>
AIP's FYI reported that at a recent advisory committee meeting, the Director
of DOE's Office of Science, Ray Orbach, announced that his office's soon-to-be-released
20-year strategic plan would include 29 major facilities projects. At his
web site
<a href="http://www.er.doe.gov/sub/mission/strategic_plan.htm">www.er.doe.gov/sub/mission/strategic_plan.htm
</a>it reports, "The Office of Science currently is preparing a new Mission
Statement and Strategic Plan. Both documents will be posted {here} as soon
as they are available, in May or June 2003." or July?
<h1>
*** TAUP03 in Seattle in September 5-9</h1>
TAUP03, which covers cosmology, dark matter/energy, neutrino astrophysics,
high-energy astrophysics, gravity, and related topics, will be held in
Seattle, Sept 5-9, 2003. Register soon. Information at <a href="http://int.phys.washington.edu/taup2003/">http://int.phys.washington.edu/taup2003/.</a>
<h1>
*** Neutrino Poetry</h1>
With several recent contributions of neutrino poetry, the neutrino oscillation
industry web site will soon unveil a poetry page. In the meantime, here
is one haiku courtesy M. Corcoran:<font color="#003300"></font>
<p><font color="#003300">Solar neutrino</font>-
<br><font color="#993366">Stealthily changing its garb</font>-
<br><font color="#660000">Mu? Tau? Who can tell?</font>
