<h1>Long-Baseline news, September 2011 </h1>

</p><h1>
*** 2012 RPP contains late neutrino data
</h1> <p>
The Review of Particle Physics, which many of us recently
received, contains 1526 pages of almost everything you want to
know about particle physics.  It doesn't have the Higgs mass right
yet, but three post-deadline papers from Double Chooz, Daya Bay
and RENO were included so that you can find the value of theta-13.

*** Daya Bay finished construction
</h1> <p>
This reactor neutrino disappearance experiment has now installed
the last 2 of its eight antineutrino detectors (AD) watching the
6 reactors to measure theta_13.  One AD was calibrated in 3
dimensions.  This is part of a comprehensive calibration for the
spectral shape analysis.  The current measurement is
sin^2(2theta-13) = 0.089 +-0.010(stat)+-0.005(syst) and the
estimated precision is 5% after 3 years.  Also 5% on Delta m^2_31.

</p><h1>
*** Daya Bay II being planned for mass hierarchy, theta-12
</h1> <p>
A large reactor neutrino experiment with good energy resolution
can be used to determine the mass hierarchy.  The current default
parameters for the Daya Bay II idea is 20kt, 3% Energy resolution,
36 GW and 58 km baseline.  Oil and Water detectors are being
considered, and a mix of 8 and 20 inch tubes gives good coverage
&amp; good timing.  PMTs with microchannel plate are being developed.
An overburden of 1350 mwe is being considered.  A possible time
schedule is for a proposal to the government in 2015 and
construction 2016-2020.  Also see

*** Should we measure theta-12 better?
</h1> <p>
We currently know sin^2(theta-12) to 5.4%.  A goal of upcoming 0nu
double beta decay experiments is to cover sensitivity to all of
the inverted hierarchy.  The 3-sigma uncertainty in theta-12 leads
to an uncertainty in the lower lifetime of a factor of 2, which
affects the sensitivity (or cost) of these experiments by 16.

*** Neutrino conspiracies?
</h1> <p>
If you are the 1st minister (i.e. governor) of 33 million people
in Kerala, and are voted out of office, and want to make a fuss to
get back in the news, one possibility is to criticize the United
States for its (so far non-existent) secret moves to study
neutrinos deep in the hills of neighboring Tamil Nadu.

*** TREND, Tianshan Radio Experiment for Neutrino Detection
</h1> <p>
This is a a Sino-French project for the radio-detection of
Extensive Air Showers induced by high energy cosmic particles.  It is
high in the mountains in northwest China where there is a very
clean radio environment above 20 MHz.  TREND 50 (50 antennas) has
been in stable operation since March 2011.  In 104 live days, they
have 33 EAS candidates with zenith less than 65 degrees.

*** NOvA first block raised into place at far detector
</h1> <p>
The NOvA long-baseline neutrino experiment in Ash River is being
built with plastic extrusions.  First several layers are stacked
horizontally in a "block" and then the block is raised.  See:

*** Viet nus 17-22 December
</h1> <p>
The Viet Nus meeting will be held in Qui Nhon in Vietnam, 17-22
Dec 2012 under the auspices of the 8th Rencontres du Vietnam.  The
main idea is to bring together  experienced researchers with young
adepts and mix ideas with actual work.  The web site is

*** LBNE passes review
</h1> <p>
The Fermilab Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment had a successful
September Director's Review.  The closeout reported, "The review
committee is confident that the LBNE Project will be ready for a
successful DOE CD-1 review in one month.  The recent
reconfiguration of the project scope was well executed yielding a
revised scope that satisfies the performance requirements
recommended by the LBNE reconfiguration steering committee."

</p><h1>
*** No LSND anomaly in a long-baseline experiment
</h1> <p>
If neutrinos oscillate in a short-baseline, they are still mixed
in a long-baseline experiment.  M. Antonello et al. (ICARUS
Collaboration) report a search for a nu_e signal due to a LSND
anomaly at 730 km. using 0-30 GeV neutrinos, and limit the numu2e
oscillation probability to &lt;5.4e-3 at 90%CL.
