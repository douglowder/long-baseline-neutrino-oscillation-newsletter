Long-Baseline news, July 2003</h1>

<h1>
*** New value of Delta-msquared from Super-K</h1>
The new preliminary best fit for dm^2 from Super-K's atmospheric nu analysis
is 2.0 10^-3 eV^2, a bit lower than before. Updates include parameters
for neutrino interactions, such as M_A, light scattering parameters in
water, outer detector PMT gains, fully automated data reduction with better
background rejection, etc., but no new data (yet). At 90% CL, dm^2 is between
1.9 and 3.0 10^-3, and sin^2 2q > 0.9. At best fit, chi^2_min=170.8/170dof.
<h1>
*** New value of theta_13 limit?</h1>
Chooz has the best limit, and Chooz hasn't changed. But if you look at
the value of the limit for the new best fit dm^2, (Figures 55 &amp; 58
of <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0301017">http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0301017</a>it
is 0.2 for sin^2 2q. It was ~0.13 for 2.5 10^-3 and ~0.11 for 3.0 10^-3.
Limits should probably be calculated at the lowest dm^2 in the CL.
<h1>
*** Lewis and Clark, Voyage of Discovery 1803</h1>
200 years ago, Lewis and Clark went across the country, looking for good
sites for neutrino experiments (though they didn't know it.) With an original
budget of $2.5K, they spent almost $39K.
<h1>
*** Cosmos and Quark, Voyage of Discovery 2003</h1>
The brochure from the National Research Council on the intersection of
particle and astrophysics, Quarks and the Cosmos, was well received in
Washington, etc. But there are particle and astrophysics projects that
are not at that intersection. A plan for a new one which includes these
other projects is underway.
<h1>
*** Fermilab June 2003 PAC Report</h1>
Besides noting the completion &amp; importance of MINOS, the PAC heard
reports on proton economics. "The committee urges the Directorate to ...
identify paths to incrementally increase the available number of protons,
possibly beyond 10 x 10^20/year." <a href="http://www.fnal.gov/directorate/program_planning/phys_adv_com/PACdates.html">http://www.fnal.gov/directorate/program_planning/phys_adv_com/PACdates.html</a>
<h1>
*** NUSEL Engineering Report Available</h1>
In July, the final version of the NUSEL-Homestake Reference Design Project
Book was released. It is available at <a href="http://int.phys.washington.edu/NUSEL/">http://int.phys.washington.edu/NUSEL/</a>

<h1>
*** COBRA 0-nu double beta decay idea</h1>
A Dortmund group is developing a new double beta decay detector using CdZnTe
semiconductor detectors. An energy resolution of 2.2% FWHM has been measured
at 2.6 MeV. See <a href="http://cobra.physik.uni-dortmund.de/">http://cobra.physik.uni-dortmund.de/</a>
<h1>
*** Yearlong US neutrino study</h1>
A yearlong neutrino study to provide input for future neutrino facility
decisions is being put together by the DPF and DNP divisions of the APS
and also may include the beams and astrophysics divisions. Office of Science
Director Orbach, whose facility plan hasn't been released yet, told HEPAP,
"The neutrino study this year is going to be of enormous value." A two-week
meeting possibly in Madison or Santa Barbara was mentioned.
<h1>
*** TEXONO at Kuo-Sheng reactor in Taiwan and 2 km away</h1>
The Taiwan EXperiment On NeutrinO was started to pursue a program in Neutrino
and Astroparticle Physics. A high purity germanium detector was used to
set a limit on the neutrino magnetic moment mu(nuebar) &lt; 1.3 10^10 mu(Bohr)
( <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0307001">hep-ex/0307001). </a>There's
a road tunnel 2 km from the reactor, which might be useful for theta_13.
<h1>
*** JPARC in Japan and 2 km away</h1>
The JPARC to Super-K neutrino program envisages a near detector at 280
meters and an intermediate detector at 2 km. The near detector would be
scintillator. The intermediate detector water with a fine-grained component
and muon identifier. The beam and the closer detector are in this year's
budget request in Japan, but not yet the 2km detector and lab.
<h1>
*** Neutrino performance measure as a 10 year goal.</h1>
The OMB has proposed 5 long-term performance measures for high energy physics,
one on neutrinos, "Determine the masses of the neutrinos and characterize
the mixing between neutrino species." <a href="http://doe-hep.hep.net/HEPAP/Jul2003/HEPAPPerformanceMeasures_crawford.pdf">http://doe-hep.hep.net/HEPAP/Jul2003/HEPAPPerformanceMeasures_crawford.pdf</a>
