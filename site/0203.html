<h1>Long-Baseline news,  March 2002 </h1>

<p> <h1>
*** Koshiba, Totsuka, Kajita win Panofsky Prize
</h1>Masatoshi Koshiba, Yoji Totsuka and Takaaki Kajita, all from the 
University of Tokyo, won the 2002 Panofsky Prize from the APS
"For compelling experimental evidence for neutrino oscillations 
using atmospheric neutrinos."  The prize recognizes outstanding 
achievements in Experimental Particle Physics. 

<p> <h1>
*** A view on the future of neutrino oscillations; (Wolfenstein)
</h1>If Kamland confirms the LMA solution for solar neutrinos there is
one most important quantity that needs to be measured: Ue3^2. 
If this is not too close to 0 there is the possibility of finding 
CP violation in oscillations.  If near 0, there would be little 
purpose in committing large resources to neutrino factories or 
very-long-baseline experiments.  Therefore the major near-term 
goal should be to find a nonzero value of Ue3 (assuming that 
one exists).  There has not been enough emphasis on this.
I have heard of these experiments in the next 5 to 10 years:
1) ICARUS  2)  NuMI off-axis, 3) CHOOZ2 or Krasnoyarsk reactor 
experiment 4) JHF2K.  Is there a critical analysis of all these 
possibilities?  Are there others? Are there efforts or decisions 
that should be made now to improve the possibilities? Please share 
my questions with others.

<p> <h1>
*** Super-K empty 
</h1>The recovery plan is to encase all existing phototubes in acrylic 
cases to prevent shock wave generation.  Tests show that this 
works.  In 13mm acrylic, there is 5-6% loss of light.  Before 
emptying, there was a 4.2 ton/hour water leak somewhere 9 meters 
from the bottom.  They will redistribute tubes, start filling in 
October, and be ready for K2K in December.

<p> <h1>
*** Fly's Eye off
</h1>The Hi-Res Fly's eye detector has been unable to take data since 
last September due to heightened security at Dugway.  Dugway is 
not only home to military weapons testing, it is also the center 
for monitoring biological agents such as anthrax.  They were kicked 
out not after the terrorist events of 9/11 but after the anthrax 
mailings.  They hope to resume data using people from Los Alamos 
with the required security clearances.

<p> <h1>
*** KamLAND on
</h1>KamLAND has been taking data since January 22, 2002 at 12:25, 
though they only have electronics for  the 1300 17 inch tubes, and not 
yet the other 700 20 inch tubes.  The reactor experiment, which 
expects 2 counts per day, requires <10^-13 g/g of U and <10^-14 g/g 
of Th.  They see <2 10^-16 g/g of each, and <2.3 10^-16 g/g of 
K40.  They probably have enough data on tape to nail the LMA, but 
the off line event builder isn't working yet.  An LMA conclusion 
could be available in a year.   For Be7 solar neutrinos, the 
largest background is currently from Krypton 85.

<p> <h1>
*** CNGS "most likely" delayed, OPERA reconsidered
</h1>Spurred by LHC budgetary problems, the CERN Research Board writes, 
"It must also be understood how much CERN can invest in OPERA, and 
if the CERN contribution is reduced with respect to what had been 
anticipated, the viability of the experiment will have to be 
reconsidered by the LNGSC and SPSC.  The CNGS beam will also most 
likely incur a delay of one year and be ready in 2006".

<p> <h1>
*** JHF2K coming, or maybe MNSP
</h1>A core committee of US, Japanese, Korean, Canadian and European 
representatives has been appointed to form the rules for the 
JHF2K collaboration, which is expected to form and submit a 
proposal this summer.   If a neutrino program can be added to the 
"Phase 1" of the JHF, neutrinos can be made in 2007.   One 
name idea is Mixing of Neutrino Species Project (MNSP).

<p> <h1>
*** Strong review for neutrino factory, though funding dips
</h1>The Muon Technical Advisory Committee gave a glowing report on 
neutrino factory R&D.  "The committee finds progress since last 
year excellent".  But, "The concurrent deterioration of base 
support at Fermilab has further undercut the situation"

<p> <h1>
*** Neutrino Physicists can't meet in the Virgin Islands in May
</h1>A long announced mid-May meeting of muon collaboration was moved 
from St. Croix when DOE lab personnel at BNL and LBNL were told 
their travel wouldn't be supported.  Unfortunately, many people 
who buy early to save money were left with nonrefundable tickets.

<p> <h1>
*** Neutrino Physicists can meet at Virgin accelerator May 2-4
</h1>The Workshop on New Initiatives for the NuMI beam is taking 
shape for three days at Fermilab.  Register on the web page.

With sessions on oscillation physics, off-axis beams, far 
detector, far site and near hall experiments, we should be able 
to answer Lincoln's questions.

<p> <h1>
*** How many neutrinos from a liquid sun?
</h1> An unconventionally presented paper on a new theory of the sun 
cost Ohio State Professor Robitaille an estimated $125,000.  It 
appeared as a full page advertisement in the March 17th New York 
Times and claimed that the sun is not in thermal equilibrium.  
The "theory" has no neutrino sector.

<p> <h1>
*** Neutrinos in Guinness book of records
</h1>The Guiness book of Records is adding a section on underground 
experiments.  If anyone knows something that should be included, 
suggestions are welcome.
