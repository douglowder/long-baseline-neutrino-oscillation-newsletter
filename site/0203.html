*** Koshiba, Totsuka, Kajita win Panofsky Prize
</h1>Masatoshi Koshiba, Yoji Totsuka and Takaaki Kajita, all from the
University of Tokyo, won the 2002 Panofsky Prize from the APS
"For compelling experimental evidence for neutrino oscillations
using atmospheric neutrinos."  The prize recognizes outstanding
achievements in Experimental Particle Physics.

*** A view on the future of neutrino oscillations; (Wolfenstein)
</h1>If Kamland confirms the LMA solution for solar neutrinos there is
one most important quantity that needs to be measured: Ue3^2.
If this is not too close to 0 there is the possibility of finding
CP violation in oscillations.  If near 0, there would be little
purpose in committing large resources to neutrino factories or
very-long-baseline experiments.  Therefore the major near-term
goal should be to find a nonzero value of Ue3 (assuming that
one exists).  There has not been enough emphasis on this.
I have heard of these experiments in the next 5 to 10 years:
1) ICARUS  2)  NuMI off-axis, 3) CHOOZ2 or Krasnoyarsk reactor
experiment 4) JHF2K.  Is there a critical analysis of all these
possibilities?  Are there others? Are there efforts or decisions
that should be made now to improve the possibilities? Please share
my questions with others.


<p> </p><h1>
*** Super-K empty
</h1>The recovery plan is to encase all existing phototubes in acrylic
cases to prevent shock wave generation.  Tests show that this
works.  In 13mm acrylic, there is 5-6% loss of light.  Before
emptying, there was a 4.2 ton/hour water leak somewhere 9 meters
from the bottom.  They will redistribute tubes, start filling in
October, and be ready for K2K in December.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Fly's Eye off
</h1>The Hi-Res Fly's eye detector has been unable to take data since
last September due to heightened security at Dugway.  Dugway is
not only home to military weapons testing, it is also the center
for monitoring biological agents such as anthrax.  They were kicked
out not after the terrorist events of 9/11 but after the anthrax
mailings.  They hope to resume data using people from Los Alamos
with the required security clearances.

<p> </p><h1>
*** KamLAND on
</h1>KamLAND has been taking data since January 22, 2002 at 12:25,
though they only have electronics for  the 1300 17 inch tubes, and not
yet the other 700 20 inch tubes.  The reactor experiment, which
expects 2 counts per day, requires &lt;10^-13 g/g of U and &lt;10^-14 g/g
of Th.  They see &lt;2 10^-16 g/g of each, and &lt;2.3 10^-16 g/g of
K40.  They probably have enough data on tape to nail the LMA, but
the off line event builder isn't working yet.  An LMA conclusion
could be available in a year.   For Be7 solar neutrinos, the
largest background is currently from Krypton 85.

*** CNGS "most likely" delayed, OPERA reconsidered
</h1>Spurred by LHC budgetary problems, the CERN Research Board writes,
"It must also be understood how much CERN can invest in OPERA, and
if the CERN contribution is reduced with respect to what had been
anticipated, the viability of the experiment will have to be
reconsidered by the LNGSC and SPSC.  The CNGS beam will also most
likely incur a delay of one year and be ready in 2006".

<p> </p><h1>
*** JHF2K coming, or maybe MNSP
</h1>A core committee of US, Japanese, Korean, Canadian and European
representatives has been appointed to form the rules for the
JHF2K collaboration, which is expected to form and submit a
proposal this summer.   If a neutrino program can be added to the
"Phase 1" of the JHF, neutrinos can be made in 2007.   One
name idea is Mixing of Neutrino Species Project (MNSP).

<p> </p><h1>
*** Strong review for neutrino factory, though funding dips
</h1>The Muon Technical Advisory Committee gave a glowing report on
neutrino factory R&amp;D.  "The committee finds progress since last
year excellent".  But, "The concurrent deterioration of base
support at Fermilab has further undercut the situation"

*** Neutrino Physicists can't meet in the Virgin Islands in May
</h1>A long announced mid-May meeting of muon collaboration was moved
from St. Croix when DOE lab personnel at BNL and LBNL were told
their travel wouldn't be supported.  Unfortunately, many people
who buy early to save money were left with nonrefundable tickets.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrino Physicists can meet at Virgin accelerator May 2-4
</h1>The Workshop on New Initiatives for the NuMI beam is taking
shape for three days at Fermilab.  Register on the web page.

With sessions on oscillation physics, off-axis beams, far
detector, far site and near hall experiments, we should be able
to answer Lincoln's questions.

*** How many neutrinos from a liquid sun?
</h1> An unconventionally presented paper on a new theory of the sun
cost Ohio State Professor Robitaille an estimated $125,000.  It
appeared as a full page advertisement in the March 17th New York
Times and claimed that the sun is not in thermal equilibrium.
The "theory" has no neutrino sector.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrinos in Guinness book of records
</h1>The Guiness book of Records is adding a section on underground
experiments.  If anyone knows something that should be included,
suggestions are welcome.
