*** DOE will support the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Project
</h1>
The DOE "received 3 strong proposals targeting R&D for neutrino 
experiment using reactors around the world. Although these 
proposals were well developed and the proponents well qualified, 
given limited resources (we) are only able to support one of them, 
the Reactor Neutrino Detector at Daya Bay, which has compelling 
scientific potential based on assessment by NuSAG, and with strong 
project planning and development, could be made technically 
feasible and affordable.  We continue to be very interested in 
pursuing a world class reactor neutrino experiment as a single 
collaborative effort from the US."  DOE also had R&D proposals
from Double Chooz (DC) and Braidwood, and a full one from DC.

<p> <h1>
*** DOE discourages Braidwood
</h1>
By rejecting the R&D proposal, DOE strongly implied a lack of
future for the Braidwood neutrino project.  Braidwood had been 
expecting a technical review, and was to present its plans at 
P5 the next week, though that was canceled.

<p> <h1>
*** HEPAP on Double Chooz - High Priority
</h1>
Double Chooz will be a quick cheap experiment sensitive to
sin^2 2-theta13 > 0.03.  The U.S. request was for about 40% of
the detector at $5M.  Braidwood or Daya Bay aim to 0.01 if syst.
errors are controlled, but at higher U.S. cost and longer time 
scale. (~$65M & $30M)  NuSAG recommended an experiment sensitive 
to 0.01, but also encouraged participation in DC "with lower 
scientific priority".  In contrast, HEPAP recommended it be high 
priority.  More HEPAP members spoke to this than any other issue.

<p> <h1>
*** Europeans on neutrinos
</h1>
Without U.S. support, Double Chooz will still proceed, but not as
fast.  In a list of main wishes of the European Neutrino Community, 
"The Double Chooz experiment should be strongly supported."

*** NSF Preparing to Fund Underground R&D in FY07
</h1>
Contingent on appropriate budget allocations and NSF approval,
the NSF Physics Division is preparing to allocate funds in FY07 
for detector-related R&D for underground, DUSEL-related physics 
experiments and related applications.  For more information, 
see the url's below, which contain a description of the NSF 
Particle and Nuclear Astrophysics program, and a presentation 
given by the NSF DUSEL Program Manager for Physics, Jon Kotcher, 
during a recent visit to the two candidate underground sites.  
Deadline for proposals will be September 2006.  More information 
will be distributed as it becomes available at:

*** EPP2010 - a linear collider and what else?
</h1>
The NAS decadal study on HEP, promotes a U.S. linear collider.  It 
endorses the LHC program, and a buildup of particle astrophysics
Plus neutrinos, proton decay and precision experiments.  Clear 
advice under priorities is "Under no circumstances, therefore, 
should the committee's top 2 or 3 priorities be permitted to 
exhaust the entire available budget".

<p> <h1>
*** How did neutrinos do in EPP2010?
</h1>
"*) A Phased program of searches for the nature of neutrino mass
(using neutrinoless double beta decay) be pursued high priority
*) DOE & NSF should invite international partners to initiate a
multi party study to explore the feasibility of joint rather than
parallel efforts in accelerator based neutrino experiments.  Major
investments in this area should be evaluated in light of the 
outcome of this process.  
*) Longer term goal should include experiments to unravel possible
CP violation in the physics of neutrinos and renewed searches for
proton decay.  There may be a valuable synergy between these 
important objectives, as the nu CP violation measurements may
require a very large detector that, if placed underground, will
also be the right instrument for detecting proton decay."
NOvA advocates worry that the 2nd point is aimed at them, though
it could also be understood to refer to NOvA upgrades.  Meanwhile,
when the world price of oil declines, NOvA costs will plummet.

*** Scoping Study for Neutrino Factory Meets at RAL
</h1>
The International scoping study and BENE (Beams for European 
Neutrino Experiments) met at Rutherford in April.

</a>
An LOI to the FP7 for Particle Physics accelerator R&D projects
was distributed for submission.  The goal is to express intent to 
submit at least one proposal to undertake a design study and R&D 
for the next generation of neutrino oscillation facilities, in 
particular the Neutrino Factory and the Beta beam.  Contact
