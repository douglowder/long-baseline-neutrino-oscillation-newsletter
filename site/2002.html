*** Hyper-Kamiokande project officially approved
</h1> <p>
The Hyper-Kamiokande project has been approved by the Japanese
Diet, with operation expected to start in 2027.  The project
consists of the detector (8.4 times larger than Super-K) and a
high-intensity beam from an upgraded J-PARC.  The first year
construction budget is 3.5 billion yen.

*** Can just one neutrino be massless?
</h1> <p>
We know two delta msquared values and thus a minimum on the
sum of the three active neutrino masses (~60 meV).  And we
know a maximum on that sum (~150-220 meV depending whom you
believe).  Consistent with that, m1 could be zero.  That would
have some interesting implications, as discussed at

*** First demonstration of ionization cooling by MICE
</h1> <p>
"Tertiary" muon beams have lower brightness than contemporary
p, e and ion beams, but if they could be cooled (reduce momentum
dispersion) and accelerated, a search for phenomena at E scales
above the LHC might be feasible.  The Muon Ionization Cooling
Experiment (MICE) has published its results which show cooling two ways:
1) a smaller beam &amp; 2) increased beam phase-space density.

Data matches
simulations, validating designs in which cooling is repeated to
produce a larger effect.

*** Budget cuts for science in the U.S.; or maybe not
</h1> <p>
The DOE FY2021 Budget Request, aka "the President's budget", calls
for a 22% decrease in U.S. funding for High Energy Physics.  Over
the last few years, proposed cuts were restored by congress, but
this is the 1st step in the process.  AIP reports the "anticipated
cost of (LBNF&amp;DUNE) grew last year from $1.85B to $2.6B, which is
40% above the top of the cost range (from 2015).  The request
attributes the increase to unexpected (SURF) excavation challenges
and lower than expected contributions from international partners.
It notes that should the project exceed (by 50%), DOE rules would
require the project to revisit (CD1). The administration proposes
to scale back work on the project from $175M to $102M in FY21."

*** Virus affecting science meetings
</h1> <p>
NuINT2020 in South Korea has moved from June to October.  Moriond
and La Thuile were canceled.  MIT won't allow attendance through
15 May at events with more than 150 attendees.  Organizers of many
collaboration meetings are waiting to see what happens.  There are
many meetings this year in hard-hit Italy.  I will try to keep the
neutrino meetings page &amp; the collaboration meetings pages updated.

*** RANT - certain words don't belong in emails.
</h1> <p>
"Meeting today" is not a good subject line for electronic
mail.  You have no idea when someone is going to read the email.
Likewise on SLACK, WhatsAp, Facebook Messenger, etc.  Put words
"today" and "tomorrow" in context with a date, day-of-week, etc.

*** Scattering and Neutrino Detector (SND) at the LHC
</h1> <p>
SHiP has a letter of intent to measure nus from pp at the LHC and
search for feebly interacting particles.  The detector target will
use nuclear emulsion and fiber tracking and the muon system will
use scintillating bars.
