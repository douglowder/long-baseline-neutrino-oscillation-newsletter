<h1>Baseball companion to Long-Baseline news, September 2015 </h1>
<p>

The <a href="1509.html">
September 2015 Long-baseline neutrino newsletter,
</a>
the "Back to the Future" Cubs world series issue,
has numerous references to the game of baseball and to
the movie "Back to the Future".  Here is an explanation
of some of those references
</p><ul>
<li> <b> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096874/?ref_=tt_rec_tt">
Back to the Future
</a> </b>
<p>  This was a set of 3 movies that came out in 1985.
In the second movie,  the hero, Marty McFly was in the future
year at the time, 2015, and, heard that the
Cubs had just won the world series.  The last time the Cubs won
was in 1907, so it has been a long time, and the Cubs have also
not won in the 30 years since the movie came out.  This motivated
Marty to buy a sports results book, which Biff stole and took back
to 1955 and changed history, since the young Biff could bet on winning
sports teams.
<br> As I write this (1 October 2015), the Cubs are one of ten teams
that have made it to the playoffs, so they might not win the 2015
World Series, but they did in the movie, so my working assumption is
that they will.

</p></li><li> <b> Baselines </b>

<p>
These are lines which run from home plate to first base and third base.
the lines also continue to the right and left field walls where there
are "foul poles".  A ball hit between these two lines is fair and in
play, while a ball hit outside the line is a foul and everyone returns
to base, unless the ball is caught in the air (an out).

</p></li><li> <b> Sox </b>

<p>
The 30 professional baseball teams have names such as Yankees, Dodgers,
Cubs, etc.  One of the teams is known as the
<a href="http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=bos">
Red Sox, </a>
and one of the
teams in known as the
<a href="http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=cws&amp;tcid=mm_mlb_sitelist">
White Sox.  </a>

1919 White Sox and this is known as the

<p>
This is an annual contest between the best team in each of the
two baseball leagues in the United States.  Although there is one
team from Canada, it is called the World Series because the first

</p></li><li> <b>  hits it out of the park </b>
<p>
If you hit the ball over the fence, it is a home run, and you
and anybody on base scores a run.  The goal in baseball is to score
more runs than the other team.

</p></li><li> <b> <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/news/roger-maris-and-the-myth-of-the-asterisk-6710147">
An asterisk in the record book  </a> </b>
<p>
This was a myth, but involved what many thought was the most
important record in baseball, the yearly home run total.
Babe Ruth held the record for many years with 60, but in 1961, the
length of the baseball season increased from 154 games to 162 games.
Roger Maris hit 61 homers, but after the 154th game, so some people
claimed he didn't really break Babe Ruth's record, and that there
should be an "asterisk" in the record book.
