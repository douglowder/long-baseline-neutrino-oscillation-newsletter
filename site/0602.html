*** NuSAG report on neutrinos released
</h1>
The NuSAG report on reactor and accelerator neutrinos has been
presented to the Nuclear Science Advisory Panel (NSAC) and the
High Energy Physics Advisory Panel (HEPAP).  Both groups
unanimously accepted the report.  Experiments which might measure
theta-13 were recommended.  NOvA at Fermilab was recommended,
as well as U.S. participation in two near detector projects for
T2K in Japan.  For reactor neutrinos, U.S. participation in Double
Chooz (France) was encouraged, and a program at either Braidwood
(Illinois) or Daya Bay (China).  The full report can be found at

Neutrino 2006 will be an interesting conference, and anyone who
wants to attend should request an invitation from .
New invitees can still register at the early bird rate.

*** NOvA Director's Review at Fermilab
</h1>
The NOvA long-baseline nu experiment at Fermilab had a director's
CD1 review (Feb-Mar) in preparation for Lehman CD1 review in April.
A draft Conceptual Design Report has been prepared.  The plan is
for a construction start in 2008.  142 scientists and engineers
are currently involved.  The cost is dominated by plastic and
mineral oil which are tied to the cost of oil.  Bids have been
received for an integration prototype which include options for
the full detector.  The TEC was $235M including contingency (FY06
dollars - burdened costs).  The building is 19% of the cost and
commodities are 52%.  The schedule range is 3.4-4.8 years.

<p> </p><h1>
*** NOvA integration prototype
</h1>
This will be built during 2007 in the MINOS service building at
Fermilab.  This is 75 mrad off axis in the NuMI beam.  This
location is a good one for testing the detector response, since
muon neutrinos from K decay have an average energy of 3 GeV and
electron neutrinos from K decay have an average energy of 2 GeV.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Fermilab Proton Driver off the table; or maybe not
</h1>
The Fermilab off-axis electron neutrino experiment NOvA can make
significant discoveries without the proton driver, but it has
more sensitivity if a booster replacement is built.  This new
super-conducting proton linear accelerator at Fermilab is plan B
if the International Linear Accelerator (plan A) is delayed or
located out of the U.S.  The large increases in both the proposed
ILC and HEP budgets for FY07 have turned more attention to plan A.
A CD0 for the International Linear Collider, likely at Fermilab,
is expected soon.   A CD0 for the proton driver is not.

<p> </p><h1>
*** G. William Foster resigns as Proton Driver Project leader
</h1>
He also resigned from FNAL, and left high-energy physics.  The
cause was CD0 cancellation "on the grounds that it conflicts with
the push for the Fast-Track ILC".  Also, "The current strategy of
'give me $10B or give me death' may be the correct approach to
take during the remainder of the Bush administration; or it may be
suicidal...However technical reality must be respected in any
strategic plan."  He also refers to the Fermilab Directorate's new
official position that we wait until ~2010 to decide whether to
build the Proton Driver."

*** Bubble Chamber in NuMI neutrino beam
</h1>
A bubble chamber built to look for dark matter has been operating
in the MINOS near detector hall.  The one liter device was built at
Chicago by the COUPP collaboration.  By operating below threshold
of alphas, it can search for dark matter/highly ionizing events.

*** Workshop on Systematic Errors in Reactor Neutrino Experiments
</h1>
About 30 attended a Paris workshop on systematic error details.
Bugey, CHOOZ and KamLAND talked about previous experience, while
Double Chooz and KASKA talked about future experiments.  Subtle
effects, such as calibration of spillin/spillout, were discussed.

*** Top 3 reasons why LBLnews is late this month:
</h1>
1.  The NuSAG report came out early;
<br> 2.  February is short; <br> 3.  An
Olympic number of neutrinos in Turino; <br>4.  I completely read one
of the theory papers; <br> 5.  I can't count
