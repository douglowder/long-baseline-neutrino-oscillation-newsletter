*** No ILC in Japan
</h1> <p>
A committee of scientists in Japan recommended against building an
ILC to the government there.  When it was seriously discussed, I
wondered whether or not there was any anti-correlation with
Hyper-Kamiokande.  I was told the funding sources would have been
different.  But both were more expensive (though different scales)
than previous science projects.

*** de Gouvea wins physics slam with neutrinos
</h1> <p>
A physics slam is a lecture during which physicists use 10 minutes
to describe their work to the general public.  At an FNAL slam in
November, Andre de Gouvea used his 10 minutes to describe neutrino
oscillations and why we care.  At the end of the evening, the
audience declared him to be the winner of the 2018 Physics Slam.

*** A You Tube connection to neutrinos
</h1> <p>
The number of Youtube links to neutrino stories in this newsletter
is increasing.  An interesting business news article describes the
career rise of the CEO of Youtube and one of Google's founders.
It was founded in 1998, the same year that Super-K conclusively
discovered neutrino oscillations.  The CEO, Susan Wojcicki, is also
the daughter of longtime MINOS spokesperson Stan Wojcicki.

*** PDG encoding of neutrino parameters
</h1> <p>
Neutrino physicist Alessandro Bettini has joined the Particle Data
Group and is helping to update the neutrino sections in the Review
of Particle Physics (RPP).  One interesting issue is that
experiments are quoting oscillation parameters for 2 mass orders
(normal and inverted) &amp; 2 octants for theta23 (upper and lower).
Should they choose errors from the global or local best fit?
Experiments are making one choice, some global fitters the other.

*** Neutrino Collaboration meetings
</h1> <p>
The neutrino meetings page also tries to maintain a list of planned
neutrino collaboration meetings (at the top), so groups can try to
minimize conflicts.  Send input if you have any.

*** Conclusions from the European Neutrino Town meeting
</h1> <p>
The document "Future Opportunities in Accelerator-based Neutrino
Physics" addresses i) the role of CERN and its neutrino platform,
ii) the importance of neutrino cross-section experiments, and
iii) the capability of fixed target experiments as well
as colliders to search for manifestations of nu mass generation
mechanisms. It makes 6 recommendations.

The plan to upgrade the proton intensity at Fermilab, mostly
for the neutrino program, is moving forward.

*** New GENIE Release for neutrino simulators
</h1> <p>
The GENIE collaboration has a new release of both Generator and
Reweight.  Reweight (v1.0.0) restores compatibility with the new
series (v3*) of Generator releases AND supports all comprehensive
model configurations &amp; tunes currently available in the Generator.
A Generator revision (3.0.2) to supports Reweight and includes
minimal changes in physics models.

To make caverns for DUNE, 875,000 tons of rock need to be
removed.  An office comes first.
