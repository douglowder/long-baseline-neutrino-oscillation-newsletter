*** 3rd physics workshop on Project X;  NOW2008, NNN08
</H1> <P>
A 3rd workshop on the Physics with (FNAL's) Project X is 
scheduled for just after the Users meeting, 5-6 Jun 08.

*** Sanford donations to Crazy Horse and Neutrino Lab
</H1> <P>
The Crazy Horse Memorial in South Dakota was started in 1948,
but still has a ways to go.  
<A href="http://www.crazyhorse.org/"> http://www.crazyhorse.org/
</A>
Philanthropist T. Denny Sanford has provided a record $5M
matching grant to work on the horse's head. Sanford also has
provided a $70M gift for the Deep Underground Science and 
Engineering Lab which should take less than 60 years to build.

<H1>
*** DUSEL Water up to 4850
</H1> <P>
The Sanford S.D. Lab at Homestake/DUSEL had hoped to get the 
pumps back on before the water level rose to 4850, where many 
new nu experiments are planned.  A precise measurement in 
April found the water at 4,688.  Pumps are now on to get it 
back down again.

*** DUSEL long-baseline nu/pdk  working group list & June mtg
</H1> <P>
An April workshop in Lead South Dakota considered a variety of 
physics (and other) experiments that can be done in a deep lab, 
including FNAL long-baseline neutrino experiments.  A working 
group has established a DUSEL Long-Baseline mail-list. Subscribe -

Select 
a mailing address and password.  There will be a DUSEL Long-
Baseline/Proton Decay S4 Working Group meeting at FNAL. The week 
of June 16-21 is tentatively selected for this one day meeting.

*** P5 Report and Neutrinos
</H1> <P>
The P5 report will be made public at the May HEPAP meeting
<A href="http://www.science.doe.gov/hep/upcoming_meetings.shtm"> http://www.science.doe.gov/hep/upcoming_meetings.shtm
</A>
but the fact that I haven't read it yet won't keep me from 
speculating.  I suspect it will say positive things about NOvA and 
Double Chooz and Daya Bay and Project X and a longer-term
neutrino program from Fermilab to DUSEL.  Of course, they can't
predict resources in our field, but they can influence how those
resources are divided for different scenarios, which in turn
might influence the probability of each scenario

<H1>
*** Bad funding scenario for neutrinos in High Energy Physics
</H1> <P>
One suggestion is that 73% of future money in HEP should go to
Dark Energy Experiments, with 23% to Dark Matter Experiments, 4%
to proton colliders, and much smaller amounts to electron machines
and neutrino experiments.  With this scheme, we would have been
much better off when the universe was only 300,000 years old.

<H1>
*** Status of RENO experiment in South Korea
</H1> <P>
The Korean/Russian collaboration for reactor nus plans to make its
Technical Design Report available in May 2008.  They are planning
a near detector 290 m from the centerline of 6 reactors spaced at
1.3 km, and a far detector in a 380 m tunnel 1380 m distant.  The
$4M tunnel will be dug from May-Nov 08, & data taking scheduled to
start in early 2010.  Also a mock-up is under construction with 
30 ten inch Hamamatsu phototubes scheduled to arrive in May.

<H1>
*** Do Mossbauer Neutrinos Oscillate (take two)
</H1> <P>
I still haven't figure out the quantum issues yet, but the  
theoretical consensus seems to be that they do.  The objection 
involves a claimed violation of the time-energy uncertainty 
principle.  The neutrino wave function has here an extension which 
is much bigger than the size of the source/emitter, The 
kinematic details (emission, absorption and magnitude of 
momenta/energies) are a bit tricky, such that x=t does not apply.

*** Neutrinos can be used to monitor nuclear reactors
</H1> <P>
A prototype cubic meter antineutrino detector has been used
to monitor the relative thermal power of the San Onofre reactor
to 3% within 7 days, potentially useful within the context of
International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) Reactor Safeguard
Regime.  See
