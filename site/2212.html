<H1>Long-Baseline news, December 2022 </H1>
<P> 


<H1>
*** Mary Bishai new DUNE cospokesperson
</H1> <P>
With Regina Rameika moving to the Department of Energy, the new
cospokesperson of DUNE is Brookhaven's Mary Bishai, (see
<A href="https://www.bnl.gov/staff/mbishai">
https://www.bnl.gov/staff/mbishai
</A>).  She had previously served as
the staff scientist of the Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment.
She now leads DUNE together with Sergio Bertolucci.

<H1> *** Hitoshi Murayama to chair P5 process, report due October 2023 
</H1> <P> The membership of P5 was announced at HEPAP in December, 
including the cochair Karsten Heeger.  Neutrino physicists on the 29 
member panel include Mayly Sanchez, Patrick Huber, Kendall Mahn & Jelena 
Maricic.  Four town halls (FNAL, SLAC, LBNL & BNL) will occur from 
January to April, plus virtual town halls focusing on early career 
scientists.  A preliminary report is due Aug 2023.  His HEPAP slides:

*** Neutrinoless double beta decay white paper
</H1> <P>
This document, 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11099"> arXiv:2212.11099 </A>
prepared for the Fundamental
Symmetries, Neutrons, and Neutrinos Town Meeting related to the
2023 Nuclear Physics Long Range Plan, has been endorsed by the
major collaborations and many theorists.  They include CUPID,
KamLAND-Zen, LEGEND, Majorana, nEXO, NEXT, SNO+, SuperNEMO, and
THEIA.  It recommends the timely construction of experiments at
the ton scale using multiple isotopes, and a robust research
program, as well as a diverse R&D program, exploring ideas with
sensitivity beyond th inverted mass ordering.

*** AQUADOM, Daya Bay, RENO, Double Chooz and SNO
</H1> <P>

Large acrylic vessels hold neutrino experiments and they hold
aquariums filled with fish (but not both together).  The December
failure of AQUADOM, thought to be the largest cylindrical tank in
the world, was a spectacular reminder of what's at stake.  The
spherical SNO chamber, built by U of Washington, successfully held a
priceless amount of deuterated water for many years.  Daya Bay,
RENO and Double Chooz had concentric acrylic tanks, and the three
experiments near nuclear reactors provided the first measurements
of the neutrino mixing parameter theta_13.  In Double Chooz, there
was some observed leakage between the gamma catcher and buffer
liquids.  See the Double Chooz Detector paper at

No fish were harmed in the conduct of any neutrino experiment.

*** Rant - Neutrinos do not oscillate as they travel; P(osc) does
</H1> <P>
Neutrino oscillations are a consequence of quantum mechanics, but
are often described wrongly, even by physicists.  If a neutrino
starts as a muon neutrino at point A and is measured to be a tau
neutrino at point B, it isn't correct to say that the change
happened in between.  They interact as flavor states and propagate
as mass states.  Neutrino oscillations are the result of mixing,
not transmutation.  I wince at language, such as appeared in this
month's CERN Courier article on KM3NeT, that "As they whiz
through the universe, ..., they have the unique ability to
oscillate between their three different types of flavors."

<H1>
*** Is it time to remeasure the half life of 71Ge?
</H1> <P>
The short answer is yes.  It was last measured in 1985 to be
11.43 +- 0.03 days by Hampel and Remsberg, PRC31, 666, but
previous measurements with larger errors varied.   Giunti et al.
in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09722"> arXiv:2212.09722 </A>
discuss how the Gallium anomaly depends on it.
A value of 13.5 +- 0.5 d would cancel the anomaly.

<H1>
*** J. Robert Oppenheimer and Neutrinos
</H1> <P>
<A href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/17/1143896431/j-robert-oppenheimer-security-clearance">
https://www.npr.org/2022/12/17/1143896431/j-robert-oppenheimer-security-clearance
</A>
Now that Oppenheimer's security clearance has been restored, it is
interesting to speculate if his work on neutrinos might continue.
In 1931, Carlson & Oppenheimer speculated that neutrinos (they
called them neutrons) with a magnetic moment might be responsible
for cosmic rays observed in cloud chambers with low ionization.
Phys. Rev. 38, 1737 (1931) & 41, 763 (1932).  They concluded,
"...there is no experimental evidence for the existence of a
particle like the magnetic neutron."  Since he passed away in 1967
further progress seems unlikely.  On a similar note, when the
prolific author Isaac Asimov died, I knew it would slow down his
rate of publishing books, but I didn't think it would stop him.
