*** SNO sees neutral current using neutrinos from the sun
</h1>
Previously SNO has measured the charged current CC rate from the 
sun, and the neutral current rate was inferred from Super-K data 
which was a mixture of CC and NC.  You might ask whether SNO 
measures the same NC rate.  The answer is yes, and as before, it 
suggests that the total number of nus from the sun is larger 
than the number of nu_e's, evidence for oscillations.  They have 
measured 576.5 NC events, along with 1967.7 CC and 263 elastic 
scatters.  An NC event is nu-D ->p n nu, and the n capture gives 
a 6.25 MeV gamma ray.  The flux of numu + nutau is 3.41 +-.45 
+-.48 10^6 cm^-2 s^-1; 5.3 sigma above 0.  Nothing tells us that 
they're from the sun, but agreement with the model is very good.

<p> <h1>
*** It's looking like the LMA
</h1>
Fitting the new SNO data through May 2001, with their NC and 
updated CC fluxes (5.09 and 1.76 10^6 cm^-2 s^-1), and other 
solar neutrino data, the LMA is favored (Large Mixing Angle 
Solution).  LOW is ruled out at 90% CL, though allowed at 99.7%.  
SMA is ruled out at more than 99.7% confidence level.  More 
NC data since the salt was added is analyzed blind for now.

<p> <h1>
*** Hence, HLMA
</h1>
KamLAND will probe the LMA with nuebar's from nuclear reactors. 
If however the Delta M^2 > 10^-4 eV^2 (named the HLMA region), it
will only observe a rate suppression but no spectral distortion 
and hence it will not measure the 
mixing parameters. Schoenert et al. propose a new medium baseline 
reactor experiment HLMA located at Heilbronn (Germany) to pin down the 
precise value of the solar mixing parameters.

*** National Research Council backs underground Lab
</h1>
The NRC committee stressed the need for a deep laboratory in a 
report presented at the APS Albuquerque meeting.  The 
chairman, Michael 
Turner, noted that such a laboratory would allow the US to leap 
to the head of international efforts in underground science. 
The report calls for the NSF & DOE to cooperate in financing 
experiments the laboratory would house.

*** Two Senate candidates on same side of the neutrino issue
</h1>
Both Senator Tim Johnson (D-South Dakota) and Rep. John Thune 
(R-South Dakota) are seeking voter recognition for their efforts 
to locate the National Underground Physics Lab in SD. 
Barrick Corporation, the new owner of the mine, remains engaged,
and is keeping the mine dry.  It has also rehired some workers
to do further cleanup in the underground areas.  Despite the lack 
of an agreement for land transfer, there is some reason for 
continued optimism.

*** How many neutrinos in your collection?
</h1>
The FY 2003 President's NSF budget includes $2 million for 
"research on neutrino collectors."  There was $10M in 2002 funding 
for the "State of South Dakota to maintain the physical integrity 
of the Homestake Mine in preparation for the potential development 
of a major research facility on that site."

<p> <h1>
*** MINOS collects first neutrino
</h1>
It's not from Fermilab.  (The beam isn't quite done yet), but the 
growing MINOS detector saw it's first atmospheric neutrino generated upward 
muon on March 26th.  Installation (through April 28th) is now over 
194 planes.  This is 2.2 kiloton, (1.6 fiducial) and MINOS is 
40.1% complete.  It is  reading out 192 planes, or 6 crates.

*** If you collect a neutrino, will it rust?
</h1>
A web site for the rap group "Oxide and Neutrino": 
<a href="http://www.oxide-neutrino.com/"> http://www.oxide-neutrino.com/ 
</a>
- but turn off your sound card (just a 
suggestion). 

<p> <h1>
*** Is neutrino physics like rocket science?
</h1>
The following statement was in the February American Scientist 
article on the statistics of deadly quarrels, "It seems easier 
to count inaccessible galaxies or invisible neutrinos than to 
count wars that swept through whole nations just a century ago."
