As I understand it, the funding agency is recommending the
beamline to the government, and a favorable ruling from the
finance ministry is expected in December of 2003.

*** Banished from Siberia
</h1>
A small group of physicists were planning to visit the formerly
secret soviet city of Zhelezhnogorsk to consider the site for a 2
detector theta_13 experiment.  After first approving the visit, the
Russian security service changed its mind and said no.  This
might/might not have something to do with US visa problems for
Russian (and other) physicists.  The earliest idea to measure
theta_13 was the proposal for KR2DET shown at Neutrino 2000.

*** Recalling Gray Davis; and a canyon
</h1>
In 2000, during a dispute about electric power in California,
Pacific Gas and Electric Company chose to mail all stockholders 2
letters blasting Governor Gray Davis.  Then declared bankruptcy.
Their Diablo Canyon reactor is a leading site for a theta_13 exp.

to find Ray Davis' Nobel lecture.  "The body captures a neutrino
about once in a lifetime.  As we will see, neutrinos captured me
early in my career"  Davis' 1st experiment's limit was 40,000 SNU.
One reviewer was not impressed:  "...one would not write a
scientific paper describing an experiment in which an experimenter
stood on a mountain and reached for the moon, and concluded that
the moon was more than 8' from the top of the mountain."

*** MINOS starts run on neutrino day
</h1>
On neutrino day at the lepton photon conference at Fermilab, the
Public Information Office Issued a press release about the start
of data-taking (without beam) for the MINOS experiment

The MANET committee is evaluating ideas for the look of MINOS'
last plane.  Now:

*** MICE meets at NUFAC
</h1>
The proposal for MICE (Muon Ionizaton Cooling Experiment) is
being viewed favorably at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.  It was
submitted by 140 individuals from 40 institutions.  Significant
financial support from the host lab is being considered.  Progress
with rf includes the discovery that Be performs well in rf cavities,
high pressure gas in rf cavities can retard breakdown without
compromising rf behavior, and there is improved understanding of rf
induced backgrounds.  Overall integration of the rf cavities, LH2
absorbers, the beamline, shielding and safety groups is far along.
There was also significant progress with Japanese FFAG development
and new a program of targetry experiments was discussed at NUFAC.

*** Munich Meeting on reactor theta_13 experiments October 9-11
</h1>
Physicists from Europe, the US, Russia &amp; Japan will meet Oct 9-11
at the Workshop on Future Low-Energy Neutrino Experiments at TUM
in Munich to plan a two (or more) detector reactor experiment to
measure theta_13.  Sites in Taiwan and Brazil are being looked at.

*** UNO proton decay collaboration
</h1>
The UNO proton decay proto-collaboration is now a collaboration.
The UNO 500 kton water detector, is considering 5 US sites:  WIPP,
Homestake, Soudan, San Jacinto and Henderson.  Their last meeting
was in Denver near the Henderson mine, a Molybdenum mine owned by
Phelps Dodge, started in 1968 with a possible location at a depth
of 4800 feet, minimum overburden ~ 4000 feet.

UCLA and BNL are jointly sponsoring a detector workshop.

*** Who saw see-saws when
</h1>
In most references to the see-saw mechanism to explain the low nu
mass, proper  credit is given, to Gell-Mann, Ramond, &amp; Slansky,
and to Yanagida. The former is from a Sep '79 workshop, but that
refers to an earlier preprint written for the Sanibel Symposium
in Feb. 79, in which the seesaw mechanism was explicitly mentioned
by Ramond with proper reference to Gell-Mann and Slansky.  A
proper reference has been suggested as:  M. Gell-Mann, P. Ramond
and R. Slansky in "The Family Group in Grand Unified Theories",
Sanibel Symposium, February 1979, CALT 68-709, retroprint
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9809459"> hep-ph/9809459, </a>
and in Proceedings of the Supergravity Workshop,
New York 1979, P. Van Nieuwhenhuizen and D. Z. Friedman eds.
