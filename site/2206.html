*** Some new things heard at Neutrino 2022 (by speaker)
</h1> <p>
(Park) The JSNS2 experiment has its first clear kaon decay at rest
signal, which it will use to check LSND; (Elliot) BEST reaffirms
the Ga anomaly, but saw no dependence on oscillation length;
(Gando) KamLAND Zen limits on 0nu2beta decay; (Schonert) War means
no Russian 2beta decay isotopes for western countries;  (Luk) Daya
Bay has improved oscillation parameters; (Vogel) New 235U results
essentially explain the previous reactor neutrino anomaly;
(Vagins) In June Super-K started adding more Gadolinium, to triple
from 0.01% to 0.03% on the way to 0.1% goal; (Caccianiga) Borexino
new results on CNO neutrinos; (Bronner) T2K showed reanalysis of
the data used for Neutrino 2020, with significant improvements for
it all;  (All) And, as they say on TV, much more.

</p><h1>
*** SBND detector finished
</h1> <p>
The TPC for the Short-Baseline Neutrino Detector was completed and
closed on 13 June.  Together with ICARUS (see below), and the
completed MicroBooNE experiment, they compose the Short-Baseline
Program at Fermilab to try to understand the MiniBooNE anomaly.

</p><h1>
*** ICARUS starts taking neutrino data
</h1> <p>
The ICARUS detector, now at Fermilab, has been operating in the
Booster Neutrino Beam since February 2020.  The top Cosmic Ray
Tracker has been included since February 2022.  Commissioning
concluded at the end of May 2022 &amp; physics data began 7 Jun, after
the completion of the 3 m of concrete overburden.  That addition
reduced the cosmic rate in the top CRT from 600 Hz to 330 Hz.

</p><h1>
*** Update from NOvA
</h1> <p>
NOvA showed a new analysis technique for its oscillation results,
a Markov Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian Analysis, which allows the
results to be scrutinized in new ways.  The conclusions about
oscillation parameters are the same as the frequentist results.
A new sterile nu search included numu events, a wider dm^2 range,
dedicated systematics and a covariance matrix fit to 3+1.  No
sterile signal was seen &amp; a competitive limit on theta_24 was set.

*** rant:  too much good nu stuff to read
</h1> <p>
<a href="https://snowmass21.org/neutrino/start/drafts">

</a>
Version 2 of the ten
Snowmass nu group reports are available in preparation for the
CSS later this month.  The "Snow-white" section below has covered
only 15 of the 80 nu white papers    How many can anyone read it
all?  This well-organized system elicited &gt;25x more to read than
previously and is overwhelming.  But I have no better idea.

postponed. If you were at NNN 2002, your picture may be at

<a href="https://snowmass21.org/submissions/nf">

</a>
 </p><p>
</p><ul>
<li> "DUNE Physics Summary",
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06100"> arXiv:2203.06100, </a>
This summarizes the
neutrino parameter measurements, astroparticle physics program and
Beyond Standard Model Searches for DUNE.  It calls on the Snowmass
process to affirm the realization of Phase I within the current
decade, Phase II upgrades in the next decade, and R&amp;D for beam
upgrades and additional detector capabilities.
</li><li> "Light Sterile Neutrino Searches and Related Phenomenology",
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07323"> arXiv:2203.07323, </a>
This 210 page document is an encyclopedic
reference concerning experimental neutrino anomalies that remain
unresolved.  Essential thrusts are 1) all anomalies; 2) diverse
signatures, 3) theory input, 4) share data, &amp; 5) robust analyses.
</li><li> "High-Energy and Ultra-High-Energy Neutrinos",
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08096"> arXiv:2203.08096, </a>
These nus probe fundamental physics from the TeV scale to the EeV
scale and beyond.  This describes the opportunities astrophysical
neutrino observations offer for astrophysics and high-energy
physics, today and in coming years.
</li><li> "Enhanced NeUtrino BEams from kaon Tagging (ENUBET)",
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08319"> arXiv:2203.08319, </a>
The absolute normalization of the flux in a
monitored neutrino beam can be constrained at the 1% level. It
summarizes ENUBET design, physics performance and opportunities
for its implementation in a timescale comparable with DUNE.
</li><li> "Future Advances in Photon-Based Neutrino Detectors",
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07479"> arXiv:2203.07479, </a>
This considers enabling technologies for future
photon-based neutrino detectors such as slow flours, water-based
liquid scintillator, and spectral sorting of photons.  It covers
novel ideas, such as THEIA, LiquidO, SLiPS and ArTEMIS.
