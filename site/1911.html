*** T2K measures electron antineutrino appearance
</h1> <p>
In
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07283"> arXiv:1911.07283 </a>,
they present a measurement of 15 events over
a background of 9.3.  They present two analyses, one showing that
the data prefer electron antinu appearance over no appearance.
They also free the rate and show it is compatible to the rate
expected using previously measured parameters of the PMNS matrix.

*** Groundbreaking at Fermilab for LBNF near site
</h1> <p>
At a ceremony at Fermilab on 14 November 2019, there was
groundbreaking for the near site of the Long-Baseline Neutrino
Facility.  The ceremony, at the site of the future hill for
the LBNF beam, included remarks by LBNF/DOE/FNAL management
and international partners.  Local officials from Warrenville,
West Chicago and Batavia also participated in the groundbreaking.

Site work is starting for DUNE-related construction at Fermilab.

*** Award for LBNF Director Chris Mossey
</h1> <p>
In October, Fermilab Deputy Director Chris Mossey was elected to
the National Academy of Construction.  They recognized Mossey for
his leadership in the military and private sectors, his commitment
to conservation, sustainability and the environment, and his
support of female, minority and young engineers through mentoring.

*** Mossey Mountain?
</h1> <p>
In his groundbreaking remarks, DOE's Associate director of Science
for High Energy Physics Jim Siegrist suggested that Fermilab have a
contest to name the hill that will built for LBNF.  He first heard
about the proposed hill (which will be 1/3rd the height of the high
rise) from former FNAL director Oddone, and he suggested possible
names of Mt. Oddone, Mt. Lockyer and Mt. Mossey.

</p><h1>
*** Congressman Foster's inside neutrino joke
</h1> <p>
Taped messages for the groundbreaking came from Senator Durbin,
Congressman Underwood and Congressman Foster.  Durbin &amp; Underwood
showed their understanding of the purpose of LBNF and DUNE.  But
Congressman Foster described an experiment he worked on looking
for neutrino oscillations as "...something so crazy that only
Larry Sulak would design an experiment to look for it."

That is, if you consider linear algebra to be basic.  (When I went
to M.I.T, linear algebra was 18.06 with a prerequisite of 18.02).
In
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02534"> arXiv:1907.02534 </a>,
Denton et al. presented a new method of
calculating neutrino oscillations in matter.  Along the way, they
derived an identity using eigenvectors and eigenvalues.  See:

*** DUNE "Module of Opportunity" Workshop
</h1> <p>
A 4th DUNE "module of opportunity" would need to be specified by
mid-2024 to start installation in mid-2027, in a technically
limited schedule.  A workshop at BNL discussed many ideas for the
technology.  The next step is writing concept papers which specify
physics capabilities, needed R&amp;D, prototype plans, requirements
and rough costs.

*** NuFACT 20 to add detector working group
</h1> <p>
A unique feature of the NuFact series is that it brings together
neutrino experimentalists, theorists and accelerator physicists.
Given the large effort in neutrino detector R&amp;D currently underway
and with new initiatives planned in the years ahead, a new working
group on detectors is created. While there is certainly overlap
with existing groups on neutrino oscillations, neutrino cross-
sections, muon physics and beyond PMNS searches, (in order of WG#)
the goal is to enlarge the participant base, as well as the topic
base, of the meetings. A search for conveners is underway. The
2020 NuFACT meeting will be 24-29 August in Sardinia, Italy.

Xianguo Lu from Oxford has developed some tools to visualize
neutrino oscillations.  The interactive mode can be found at

*** SBND cryostat completed
</h1> <p>
The construction of the cryostat steel structure for the Short-
Baseline Neutrino Detector has been completed.  This was done
by INFN,  CERN and FNAL crews.  A collection of daily progress
and pictures is at
