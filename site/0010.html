*** Water in the Missouri River
</h1>The funding bill for the Department of Energy, which includes
High Energy Physics, which includes Neutrino Experiments, was
part of the energy/water bill, which President Clinton vetoed
because of a disagreement about the level of the Missouri River.
The bill has since been passed and signed.
In the new FY01 budget, NuMI construction proceeds as planned.

*** Nestor in warm water
</h1>Nestor is ready to deploy 2 floors (28 pmt), but when the cable was
laid this summer by a contractor (ALCATEL), not enough tension
was applied and some fibers broke.  They accepted responsibility
and will fix it soon.  Nestor will be a tower of 12 hexagonal
floors of 32 m diameter at vertical interval of 20 m with highly
sensitive photomultipliers  at the corner points (168 for phase 1).
When ready, the high bandwidth electro-optical cable will provide
capabilities for several simultaneous projects.  This is called
LAERTIS (Laboratory in the Abyss of Europe with Real time data
Transfer to shore for Interdisciplinary Studies)

*** Less Water
</h1>Kamioka was a water detector but KamLAND will use scintillator.
KamLAND installed the last inner detector PMT in September and
started the outer detector in October.  The final pieces of the
acrylic sphere are in place and the balloon will go in next
Spring.  If all goes well, good data in about a year.

*** Salty Water
</h1>The President of Israel welcomed the delegates to Neutrino '94 a
few days after his 70th birthday.  He asked if anyone there was
over 70.  Only Leon Lederman raised his hand.  "I'm so old",
Lederman said, "I knew the dead sea when it was still just sick."

<p> </p><h1>
*** Salty Water Meeting
</h1>With fresh water pools at this dead sea resort, the Particle
Astrophysics Winter School is meeting at Ein Gedi in January
2001.  See <a href="http://www.weizmann.ac.il/physics/heap/WinterSchool/">

*** More Water-UNO needs a new name
</h1>A proto-collaboration has formed to make a new ~20x Super-K water
detector for nucleon decay and neutrino physics.  It's been
called UNO, UNNO, UUNO, ... but they are looking for a new name.
Their first collaboration meeting is December 18-19 at Carlsbad NM.

*** JHF looking for a new name
</h1>The JAERI-KEK Joint Project for a new Hadron Machine in Japan was
formerly known as the Japanese Hadron Facility.  This project had
a review in July and was strongly endorsed.  They also recommended
that priorities be set since there are many different elements and
the cost is high.  The entire facility is to be constructed
within 10 years, while the first priority is the construction and
completion of the accelerators (both 3 GeV at 1 MW and 50 GeV).
The decision by the Agency of Finances is due in late December.

*** Chinese water, Long-Baseline from Tokai to Beijing
</h1>If built, a good distance for a CP violation study using a muon
storage ring at Tokai is 2100 km, the distance to Beijing, where
a detector would get 1300 events/100 kt-Yr.  One idea is for a
Water Cerenkov Calorimeter, using 10,000 tanks, each 1m x 1m x
10m, along with RPC's and magnets.  Professor H. Chen, director
of IHEP is considering for China to build a large detector for
cosmic-ray physics now, later for JHF, and then the nu factory.

*** Neutrinos faster than water?
</h1>A new equation says they're faster than light.

</h1>See

The study will go
from 23 October, 2000 to 22 April, 2001.

*** Supernova on the beach, Feb 15-16 2001 in Marina del Rey.
</h1>A meeting on the Physics Potential of Supernova II Neutrino
Detection will be held in February.  Email

*** TAUP 2001 September at Gran Sasso
</h1>TAUP 2001, a meeting on Topics in Astroparticle and Underground
Physics will take place September 8-12, 2001 at Laboratori
Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Italy.  email
