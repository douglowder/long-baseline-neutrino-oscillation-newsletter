<h1>Long-Baseline news, September 2007 </h1>

*** NuMI vacuum decay pipe switching to Helium
</h1> <p>
After a shutdown, NuMI/MINOS is ready to start again.  Concern
about possible long term corrosion damage to the vacuum window of
the decay pipe has led to a plan to fill the decay pipe with He.
This will reduce stress on the window and make a catastrophic
failure less likely.  A 3% loss in neutrino flux is expected.

</p><h1>
*** MiniBooNE run over but still running
</h1> <p>
MiniBooNE was only approved to run until the present shutdown, but
after the shutdown is over, SciBooNE is running, so MiniBooNE will
continue to get beam.  They also have submitted a proposal to be
considered by the PAC for a further 3E20 in anti-neutrino mode.
This should take a further 2 years and enable them to perform a
search for anti-nue appearance with 'similar' sensitivity to nue.

</p><h1>
*** MiniBooNE Low energy excess more excessive at lower E
</h1> <p>
MiniBooNE did not see an excess of electron neutrino events
which could be interpreted as oscillations with the same
2-neutrino parameters as LSND.  But they did see an excess of
electron neutrino candidates at low energy.  They have further
studied the low energy region and haven't identified the
explanation of the excess.  If they lower the energy threshold
of the analysis (to 200 MeV), the excess grows.  See slide 25 of

*** CARE07 meeting 29-31 October at Cern:
<a href="http://cern.ch/CARE07"> http://cern.ch/CARE07
</a>
</h1> <p>
The main objective of the CARE project - Coordinated Accelerator
Research in Europe - is to generate a structured and integrated
European area in the field of accelerator research.  The program
includes advanced scientific &amp; technological developments relevant
to accelerator research for Particle Physics.  It is articulated
around 3 Networking Activities and 4 Joint Research Activities.
The main objective of BENE NA is to coordinate and integrate the
activities in a worldwide context, towards achieving superior
neutrino beam facilities for Europe.

*** Fermilab Steering group choices on theta-13
</h1> <p>
A final report of the Fermilab steering committee on the future
of FNAL is now out -
<a href="http://www.fnal.gov/pub/directorate/steering/">
http://www.fnal.gov/pub/directorate/steering/
</a>
A Fermilab discovery plan is mapped out, depending on such things
as the value of theta-13 and the schedule of the ILC.  Chapters
4 &amp; 5 deal with neutrinos as the "Intensity Frontier".  Neutrino
fluxes are estimated for 1) now, 2) proton plan, 3)NOvA, 4)SNuMI
and 5) Project X, ranging from 176 to 2314 kW at 120 GeV.
Appendices deal with issues such as the international neutrino
program, neutrino science at 8 GeV and 800 GeV, and mu e conversion.

</p><h1>
*** The ILC can't be delayed.
</h1> <p>
The date of various projects is often compared to the technically
driven ILC schedule put out by the GDE, but that doesn't include
time for convincing Congress, getting money, international
agreements, passing treaties, etc.  Therefore, the ILC doesn't
have a real schedule, so it can't really be delayed.  Some ILC
proponents may be worried that Project X will delay the ILC.

</p><h1>
*** Workshop on Physics with a high intensity proton source, Nov 16-17
</h1> <p>
Workshops have been scheduled to study the Accelerator aspects of
Project X 12-13 November, and to study the Physics 16-17 Nov.
The plan is to have a follow-up workshop in January.  See the
meetings page

*** More oscillations seen by KamLAND
</h1> <p>
Pushing to lower energy, a better "oscillation" signal is seen
Delta msquared is measured to 2.8% precision 7.59 10^-5 +- .21

*** Another new accelerator to cost $50B for something (TheOnion)
</h1> <p>
In the units of the ILC, $50B is 5 Barishes, or in units
relevant to neutrino physics, it is 5000 milliBarish.
