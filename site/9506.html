</p><h1>Long Baseline news,  June 1995</h1>
<p>
</p><h1> *** HEPAP nu oscillation subpanel at FNAL 3 days </h1>
At Fermilab, the MINOS collaboration emphasized a large
number of signatures and ability to distinguish oscillation
scenarios.   The subpanel seemed to appreciate the capability for
NC/CC separation and its sensitivity for oscillations.  There was
considerable discussion about the definition of an appearance
experiment.  There was some confusion about possible scenarios
for Wide Band Beam running using a horn versus Narrow Band Beam
running using a Lithium Lens.  There was an impressive video
shown by the COSMOS group about automatic scanning of emulsion in
Nagoya for the short baseline experiment.

<p>
</p><h1>*** HEPAP nu oscillation subpanel at BNL 3 days </h1>
At Brookhaven, the E889 collaboration emphasized the ability to
do a counting experiment with minimal Monte Carlo corrections for
an oscillation signature.  The subpanel seemed to appreciate the
four identical counters seeing a similar spectrum 1.5 degrees off
the neutrino beam axis.  There was considerable discussion about
backgrounds for the two ring pizero neutral current events.
There was some confusion about the low energy energy spectrum and
comparisons with BNL-E734.  There was an impressive video
showing the planned detector locations, a TOSCO oil depot in
Northville and an Agriculture Department property on Plum Island.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Costs </h1>
BNL E889 costs for the beam and detector, including contingency,
were presented as $67.6 Million.  FNAL costs were submitted in
May as follows:  (including contingency and project management)
NuMI WBB beam $57.1M, NBB $1.6, MINOS $50.7M, COSMOS $11.7M,
Soudan Hall $5.5M, Soudan 2 near detector, $1.1M.  Some costs
were revised when presented.  The "project" to be included on the
Schedule 44 was the NuMI beam, about $60M.  The Lehman panel
carefully evaluated costs and funding sources at both Labs.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Do we have to pay it back? </h1>
Arriving home after two days of presentations to the subpanel,
my ten year old asked me, "Did you get the loan?"

<p>
</p><h1>*** Cogne meeting at CERN </h1>
The COGNE meeting of CERN's SPS committee spent 13 hours discussing
neutrino physics.   The main subject of the meeting was the planned
ending of the LEAR program.  In spite of the committees endorsement
of the pbar program, the DG will probably close LEAR at the end of
1996, purely on grounds of cost savings.  Detailed presentations
were from ICARUS, NESTOR, CHORUS, NOMAD and a new short base-line
(800m) 400t "baby icarus".  The committee was greatly impressed by
the progress being made at Gran Sasso and the ICARUS project with a
600 ton first module now in the tendering stage. The re-design of
the LHC transfer tunnel (warm magnets), adds 15M SwF to the 35m SwF
beam cost.  It might take CERN 5 years to complete the beams after
the necessary environmental studies.  In view of this and the fact
that the 1000 m tunnel did not allow for a near detector, and that
it ended up beneath a cemetery in Meyrin, near the airport the
committee deferred any firm decision.  The minutes might say "A
substantial contribution from the host laboratory (Gran Sasso)
should be a prerequisite for any further move".  CHORUS is going
well with vertices being found in the emulsion as planned.  NOMAD
will have a full detector by August.  Both will finish running by
1997.  The possibility of setting a 400t liquid argon 'baby icarus'
in the West Area is at least 4-5 years away.

</p><h1> *** New limit on numu to nutau from CCFR </h1>
Donna Naples, Kevin McFarland and the CCFR collaboration have
done a neutrino oscillation analysis of CCFR data using a version
of what MINOS calls the T test.  The data was the quad triplet
data with a mean 140 GeV energy.  Systematic errors using one
detector are a bit worse than the statistical errors of .0024
(errors in sin**2 2theta).  The 3 worst errors are detector
systematics, nu-e's and charm mass.  Limits similar to E531,
are the most stringent to date for 25<dmsq<90 ev^2.="" <p="">
