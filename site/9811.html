</head><body><h1>Long-Baseline news,  November 1998 </h1>


<p> </p><h1>
*** Main Injector is accelerating
</h1>Protons have reached 120 GeV.  Some even 150 GeV.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Long-Baseline is now baselined
</h1>The MINOS/NuMI project passed its Lehman "baseline" review in
early November, with a variance of less than 1%, which is
considered too small to need to change anything.  Thus the next
steps, preparation of Title 1 for the beam, and putting out the
bid to excavate the detector hall, are proceeding.

<p> </p><h1>
*** But those bats (not Sammy Sosa's and not Mark McGwire's)
</h1>The contract for blasting the MINOS cavity is ready to be put
on the street for bids.  We had hoped to start blasting in
January, but &gt;500 bats have started hibernating near the MINOS
entrance, despite some anti-bat counter measures.  That sample
portends thousands nearby out of ~200,000 in the mine.  Thus
the excavation will probably start in May rather than March '99.

<p> </p><h1>
*** European long-baseline meeting
</h1>In early November, a joint meeting of the CERN and Gran Sasso
Scientific Advisory Committees considered plans for neutrino
physics in Europe.  The SPSC concluded that it would make sense to
do a neutrino experiment in Gran-Sasso. The timing depends on
funding and will be left to the new Director General to sort out.
This probably means that there will be no firm plans for a year.

<p> </p><h1>
***SNO half empty, half full
</h1>The SNO detector has just passed the half way point in filling
with heavy water and the light water shielding. All but a few
percent of the photomultipliers and associated electronics have
been commissioned and measurements of radioactive background
events in the detector have been proceeding. Preliminary
measurements of gamma ray fluxes from the cavity walls are as
expected and radioactive purity of the heavy and light water
is already very near the design objectives. Water filling is
proceeding steadily and should be completed early in 1999.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Auger has interesting neutrino capabilities
</h1>If Auger sees events at the horizon, they are probably from
neutrinos interacting deep in the atmosphere.  The timing
signatures will make it easy to separate these from 1500 normal
showers per year with zen angle &gt; 70 deg.  They are sensitive to
10^18 eV neutrinos which were predicted by early AGN models, but
are likely ruled out by recent calculations of Bahcall &amp; Waxman.

The detector will have 10 km^3-sr H2O equivalent.
Groundbreaking in Argentina will be the Ides of March, '99.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrino symposia in March at Chemical and Physics meetings
</h1>"Do Neutrinos Oscillate? Recent Developments about Solar,
Atmospheric and Accelerator Neutrinos" will be the subject of a
symposium during the American Chemical Society Meeting in Anaheim
California March 21-22.  Contact .
At the Centennial APS meeting in Atlanta, a session on neutrinos
will Wednesday, March 23,  11:00-2:00 with talks by Davis,
Burrows, Totsuka and Haxton.

<p> </p><h1>
*** A poor attempt at a joke
</h1>A Neutrino goes into a bar. It says to the bartender, "How much is
a beer?".  The bartender smiles and says, "For you, no charge."

They show that the observed zenith angle dependence of the
atmospheric neutrinos can be accounted for by neutrino decay.
Furthermore, it is possible to account for all neutrino anomalies
with just three flavors.

Any anomalous neutrino strong-interaction at high energy, as
hypothesized by some to explain the cosmic-ray events above the
Greisen cutoff, results in an anomalously large ELASTIC nu-N cross
section at much lower energy.
