*** Open LBNE meeting 30 July-1 August at Fermilab
</h1> <p>
As LBNE (The Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment) prepares to
transition into LBNF, in a not-yet-defined process, it welcomes
all interested parties to attend its collaboration meeting
30 July - 1 August at Fermilab.  It will be preceded by a
workshop on near detector parameters 28-29 Jul. Agendas &amp; Register

*** Driving Nu Physics, MicroBooNE moved into place
</h1> <p>
The 30 ton MicroBooNE detector was driven 3 miles and moved into
place in the Booster Beam on 23 June.  It will resolve if the low
energy excess of MiniBooNE is due to photons or electrons.  Video:

The opening talk at Neutrino 2014 explained how to be a "savvy"
driver in Boston.  Outreach at the meeting involved students from
throughout Boston.

*** Sterile neutrinos at Neutrino 2014
</h1> <p>
Kopp described the usefulness of sterile nus for SM&amp;phenomenology:

A standard model singlet fermion can be leftovers of extended
gauge multiplets.  It helps explain the small nu mass, baryon
asymmetry of the Universe, dark matter and various anomalies.
But a global fit shows "severe tension" with 3+1/2/3, 1303.3011.
Some new limits were presented by MINOS &amp; others.

*** Excess in reactor neutrino fluxes at 5 MeV
</h1> <p>
At Nu 2014, RENO reported a "new reactor component at 5 MeV".  It
looked statistically compelling, but with systematics was quoted
as a 3.6 sigma effect.  It is consistent with measurements from
CHOOZ, Double Chooz and others.  See slide 33 of the review at
<a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/303475/contribution/11/material/slides/0.pdf#page=33">
https://indico.cern.ch/event/303475/contribution/11/material/slides/0.pdf#page=33
</a>
It is probably unrelated to the fits to theta_13 or to the reactor
neutrino anomaly, but that needs some thought.  More likely it is
an interesting or uninteresting nuclear physics issue.

*** T2K running again; to concentrate on antineutrinos in 2014
</h1> <p>
While J-PARC was off for a radiation incident, the Linac was
upgraded, 3 horns were replaced &amp; a new beam monitor installed.
T2K has restarted and seen its first antinu during an antinu test.
It's interesting that comparing T2K data so far with reactor data,
the best overlap is for normal hierarchy and delta=270.  Lucky!?

*** Updated results from Daya Bay
</h1> <p>
The reactor nu experiment in China reported 621 days with 6 and 8
running detectors + 6 reactors.  The best fit of sin^2 theta13
from Gd is 0.084 +- 0.005.  Using H captures, 0.083 +- 0.018.
They presented stringent sterile limits in the low mass region.

*** David Wark's view of cosmological fits to Neutrinos
</h1> <p>
Will cosmological data measure the hierarchy before long-baseline
experiments?  In Dave Wark's experimental perspectives view:
"Cosmological data is rare and precious stuff for determining the
properties of the early Universe.  We shouldn't waste it measuring
Nu properties.  (They) should be inputs to cosmology, not outputs.
That statement is (to me) independent of the quality of the
cosmological data."

</p><h1>
*** PIP-II status
</h1> <p>
The US strategic plan called for Fermilab to aggressively move
forward on the Proton Improvement Plan II, to provide &gt; 1 MW for
long-baseline neutrino experiments.  It is a complete, integrated,
cost effective concept that also leverages U.S. superconducting
rf investment, attracts international partners and provides
a platform for the long-term future of Fermilab.  Summary/Details:

*** US appropriations committees appreciate P5 report
</h1> <p>
2300 Physicists signed their support for the 10 year plan.
<a href="https://usparticlephysics.pa.msu.edu/authorlist/show.php">
https://usparticlephysics.pa.msu.edu/authorlist/show.php
</a>.
In its appropriation bill, the house committee stated, "The
Committee applauds the (DOE) for (P5) and continues to support a
clearly articulated vision under realistic budget scenarios for
each of the Science programs." Regarding LBNE, "The Committee
recognizes the importance of this project to maintaining American
leadership in the intensity frontier and to basic science
discovery of neutrino and standard model physics."  $12M was added
for LBNE over the President's budget by both the House and Senate.
