*** Progress on the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility
</H1> <P>
Having finished nine "reliability projects" to support several
years of LBNF construction and DUNE operation, a contract for
excavation of approximately 800000 tons of rock was signed with
Thyssen Mining in November.  It will start in April 2021.

A noticeable feature is where the conveyor to move the rock over
South Dakota highway 85 to deposit the rock in a large open cut.

*** Happy 90th Birthday Neutrino 4 December 2020
</H1> <P>
As I write this, Pauli's neutrino idea is 90 years old.  Thanks to
Patrick Huber for pointing this out at a Snowmass meeting.

*** Artificial particle accelerator
</H1> <P>
I've always thought of Fermilab, CERN and J-PARC as real, but nus
from these are the subject of the workshop on artificial neutrino
sources, NF09 for Snowmass.

*** Former artificial radio observatory
</H1> <P>
Not really a neutrino facility, but I was heartbroken at the loss
of the Arecibo Radio Observatory.  I had a chance to visit it back
in 1980 and tour the antenna, hanging 492 feet in the air. My pix

*** Masatoshi Koshiba 1926-2020
</H1> <P>
Koshiba was the instigator of both the Kamioka nucleon decay
experiment (Kamiokande) and Super-K.  He won the Nobel Prize in
2002 "for pioneering contributions to astrophysics, in particular
for the detection of cosmic neutrinos."  His instincts made him
pursue the atmospheric neutrino anomaly, which was explained by
neutrino oscillations, when many others dismissed cosmic ray
results as being too untrustworthy.

*** Samoil Bilenky 1928-2020
</H1> <P>
Samoil Bilenky, from JINR, Dubna, Russia, has passed away 5 Nov.
He was a founder of modern neutrino physics and had a leading role
in its evolution to its present mature state.  In a fruitful
collaboration and co-authorship with Pontecorvo, which started in
the 70's, he developed the theory of nu oscillations in vacuum and
laid the foundations of the phenomenological theory of nu mixing,
on which every theoretical model of neutrino mass generation
(including GUTs) is based. In the early days of his career he left
his mark in the field of polarized scattering phenomena obtaining
important results on the relation between the particles intrinsic
parities and the polarization effects in scattering processes.
He was an excellent teacher, mentor and inspiration for many young
researchers in the field of elementary particle and nu physics and
had collaborators and friends in many countries.  His human warmth
and benevolent personality embodied the best humanistic & cultural
traditions of the Russian Intelligentsia to which he belonged.
