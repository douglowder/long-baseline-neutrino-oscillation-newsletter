*** NOvA Proposal
</h1>
The Proposal to Build an off-axis detector to study numu to nue 
oscillations in the NuMI beamline was submitted to Fermilab 3/15.
160 authors from 34 institutions signed the proposal.  John 
Cooper (Fermilab) and Gary Feldman (Harvard) are cospokespersons.

*** US Office of Science Goals
</h1>
US HEP and Nuclear goals have been defined by a strategic plan 
with some dates between 2003 & 2026 (for estimated completion).  
<a href="http://www.sc.doe.gov/Sub/Mission/Mission_Strategic.htm"> 
http://www.sc.doe.gov/Sub/Mission/Mission_Strategic.htm </a>
Among 19 HEP goals are:
2005 Begin studies of neutrino mass differences and flavor mixing 
with NuMI/MINOS to clarify the neutrino's Standard Model role.
2011 Determine the pattern of nu masses and mixing parameters
2021 Using Super Neutrino Beam, begin measurements of 
matter/antimatter asymmetry in the lepton sector
2026 Measure neutrino masses from studies of double beta decay, 
helping to set energy scale for unification
2026 Use knowledge of neutrino mass to clarify role of neutrinos 
in dark matter and stellar explosions (supernovae)
Among 27 Nuclear Physics Goals:
2006 Quantify neutrino mixing using neutrinos from the sun, 
cosmic-ray interactions, and nuclear reactors
2011 Establish an electron neutrino mass
2013 Begin experiments to look for nu-less 2-beta decay to provide 
essential information about the absolute scale of neutrino masses

*** Fermilab long-range plan and visions
</h1>
Fermilab's vision is to build a linear collider.  In case what 
you see isn't what you get, a second vision is to expand the 
neutrino program with a proton driver.  To do this, Fermilab will 
prepare a case sufficient to achieve a statement of mission need 
(CD0) for a 2 MW proton source.  There was a general feeling that 
specifics for this vision weren't clear at an FNAL presentation.

*** MINOS has a beamline
</h1>
On March 10, Fermilab accepted beneficial occupancy of the Service 
Building, the MINOS Shaft outfitting, and all the underground 
outfitting work downstream of the Target Hall area (the Target 
Area had been previously accepted in October 2003.)

*** CERN Workshop on neutrino beams May 25-27
</h1>
The Workshop organized by ECFA/BENE & EURISOL intends to explore
the opportunities offered by a multi-MW p beam of a few GeV,
in particular, in the neutrino, slow muon, K sectors and for
radioactive ion beams.

*** Three NSF solicitations for Underground Lab
</h1>
As a next step for NUSEL/DUSEL, the NSF announced a process in 
which they would issue 3 solicitations for proposals and then 
would issue some grants to conduct studies for an underground 
lab.  Solicitation I ; "Research & Associated Technical 
Requirements" would clearly articulate a science and engineering 
research program for the lab.  It should be site independent and 
ideally involve everybody.  Simultaneously, Solicitation II would 
involve site development and Conceptual Design for a lab, and 1-3 
site specific proposals at $300,000 for 6 months could be 
supported.  90 days to respond.  Later Solicitation 3: "Detailed 
Infrastructure Plan for Underground Science and Engineering".

*** Double CHOOZ approved
</h1>
Well there are more hoops still to be jumped through, but the APC 
and Saclay each agreed that a new two detector experiment should 
be built at CHOOZ to measure theta_13.  Other ideas for experiments 
which reported progress at the 3rd workshop on Future Low Energy
Neutrino Experiments in Niigata Japan were Braidwood Illinois, 
Angra Brazil and Daya Bay China.

*** Dips
</h1>
The reported dip from Super-Kamiokande in the atmospheric 
neutrino L/E distribution is controversial to some dip seekers.

There were also some different ideas back in the 60's about what 
constituted a dip:

*** Solar Neutrinos and the snow cover in France
</h1>
The distinguished French Newspaper Le Monde reported that the 
French Power company, EDF, uses solar neutrinos to analyze the 
mountain snow cover, and hence predict its hydroelectric power 
potential each season.  40 geiger counters have been installed in 
the french mountains where "neutrinos...are absorbed by water 
molecules".  Scuttlebutt is a journalism major got it a bit wrong.
