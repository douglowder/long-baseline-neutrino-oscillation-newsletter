</p><h1>*** New positive LSND result out soon; New York Times
</h1>
As reported in today's New York Times, the nu mass may be about 2.5 eV.
LSND is to give a seminar at Los Alamos on Thursday.  Rumors are that
they have a bigger effect than before, with about 3 times the data.
(Before they had 9 events with a background of one.)  The rumor
was they now see nue to numu in addition to nuebar to numubar.
The rumor also says they have evidence for oscillations across their
detector.  Their goal is also to have a preprint by mid February.
One rumor puts sin^2 2-theta at 0.02, another at 0.003.
Karmen still says P &lt; 6 * 10^-3, and BNL limits are in PRL 68, 274(1992).

<p>
</p><h1>*** Karmen may have spotted novel particle.  Axion? Heavy nutau?
</h1>
KARMEN doesn't see numubar to nuebar neutrino oscillations, but they do
have about 100 events coming about 3-4 microseconds after the
beam dump, which would correspond to 30 MeV if it were a particle
(such as an axion) decaying in flight.  A paper is in the works.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Fermilab Long Baseline experiment dubbed MINOS; alias P-875
</h1>
The Institutional Board of the Fermilab long baseline collaboration
chose the name MINOS, standing for "Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation
Search", but in approaching the Minnesota legislature, use of
"Minnesota Illinois Neutrino Oscillation Search" is ok.  The Logos
will have a double-horned Minotaur, but even many wide band beam
afficianados don't get the two-horn bit.

<p>
</p><h1>*** CHORUS/NOMAD extensions approved
</h1>
Originally approved for 1994 and 1995, an extension of 12 x 10^18
protons in 1996 has been approved, with an extension into 1997 likely.
Replacement of the CHORUS emulsion and the air core magnet need funding,
which has been approved by the Italians and expected in Japan.
CHORUS has 130,000 CC events on tape.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Hepap Subpanel
</h1>
Hepap has a meeting at Cornell in mid-May, so the hope is that the
Subpanel on long baseline would have a recommendation by then.  Tom
Romanowski at the DOE office has been made the secretary of the
Subpanel and is soliciting names for inclusion.   John O'Fallon has said
that he wants an answer by June 1995, though Martha Krebs letter had
mentioned October.

<p>
</p><h1>*** IMB
</h1>
Some IMB collaborators remain quite unenthusiastic about a neutrino
oscillation interpretation of the atmospheric neutrino deficit.  The
suggestion is that the ratio depends on the fiducial volume.  IMB
data shown at Baton Rouge in 1993 showed no dependence on fiducial volume,
but there are other ways to plot the data.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Gran Sasso meeting(s)
</h1>
A meeting in Gran Sasso in December considered new options for a long
baseline experiment from CERN, in addition to the ICARUS and NESTOR
proposals.  NOE has been introduced as a technique based on scintillating
fibers and has been proposed to be used in a an experiment able to
study  both atmospheric and beam nus. Another RICH detector, dedicated
to long baseline, could be installed in Gran Sasso or on the surface.

<p>
</p><h1>*** proposal status
</h1>
The MINOS proposal, led by editor Dave Ayres (using a combination of
skills from William Shakespeare and Attila the Hun) is nearing
completion.  It is about 225 pages, with over 100 authors from 19
institutions.  The reference detector is now 10 kT, with several
tests for neutrino oscillations with both a wide band beam and a
narrow band beam.


<p>
</p><h1>*** Threefold Maximal mixing predicts 5/9 for solar, atmo </h1>

A new paper by Harrison Perkins and Scott has a very interesting new
wrinkle on neutrino oscillations.  Maybe the mixing matrix is threefold
maximal (as some have suggested for the quarks before it evolves with
energy due to quantum corrections.)  The neutrino matrix plausibly
doesn't so evolve.  The simple prediction is that P(nu-&gt;nu) is 5/9
at high L/E and 2/9 into each other species.  This matches both
atmospheric and solar data!  Homestake is low outside of errors,
but a simultaneous fit can then be made to all accelerator, reactor,
atmospheric and solar data.   This would imply MINOS would see BOTH
numu to nutau AND numu to nue.

</p><h1>*** repeat--NuMI notes on World Wide Web (This is not long baseline news)
</h1>
A page with the NuMI index and about 1/3 of the notes themselves is now on
World Wide Web:  http://www.hep.anl.gov/Hypertext/NDK/numi_notes.html
