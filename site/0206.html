*** New results from K2K
</h1>
The KEK to Kamioka Long-Baseline Neutrino Oscillation Experiment 
recently reported updated results which provide increased 
confidence in the existence of neutrino oscillations.  The new 
results represent all data accumulated by K2K from April 1999 to 
June 2001.

*** The next step in Neutrino Oscillation Measurements
</h1>
A Fermilab neutrino study group came up with a physics statement 
which attempted to represent a consensus among neutrino 
physicists about our goals for future experiments.  The text is in

In summary, theta_13, theta_13, theta_13.

*** Neutrino Facilities Advisory Committee Roadmap
</h1>
The National Science Foundation is considering support for 
Ice-Cube, but many other future neutrino facilities, such as NUSL 
and others are also under consideration.  A panel was appointed 
to get the neutrino picture and they met June 24th to look at 
double beta decay experiments, the underground lab, long-baseline 
experiments, neutrino telescopes, etc.  Originally to be chaired 
by George Trilling, Barry Barish ran the meeting.  A workshop
(next item) and this NRC study will provide information needed for 
funding agencies, OSTP, OMB, and Congress to develop a road map for 
this research in the context of planned investigations worldwide.

*** NESS 2002
</h1>
The International Workshop on Neutrinos and Subterranean Science, 
NeSS 2002, will be held in Washington D.C., 19-21 Sep 02. NeSS 2002 
will be a major workshop designed to review and integrate the 
results of many of the recent developments in neutrino, low 
background and geo-science investigations requiring great
subterranean depth. The genesis of the workshop is a statement 
found in the fiscal year 2003 budget request for the NSF.

*** Yang Neutrino Workshop 11-13 October 2002 at Stonybrook
</h1>
A conference on Neutrinos and Implications for Physics Beyond the 
Standard Model will cover experimental and theoretical neutrino 
topics, including oscillations but also grand unified models & 
extra dimensions.  Links to these and other meetings 
can be found at

*** MINOS dedication July 2
</h1>
A grand opening ceremony for the Soudan Underground Lab, in part 
to thank the State of Minnesota for its support of the MINOS cavity 
construction, is taking place 2 July.  1/2 of the MINOS far-detector 
planes are up (248 mounted 6/24), & more than half of the 
magnet windings for the 1st supermodule are installed.  At the 
FNAL end, Chicago Bridge & Iron, NuMI Decay Pipe subcontractor 
to S. A. Healy, transported the 56th and final piece of the decay 
pipe underground on 6/27/02.  It is all welded together.

*** Is solar chi-squared too good?
</h1>
Global solar neutrino fits favor the LMA, but SMA and LOW do not 
have bad chi-squared.  The LMA best fit chi-squared may be too 
good.  This may be because experiments overestimate systematic 
errors.  What is P(every experiment reports their errors right)?

Francois Vannucci has published a novel (in french) about a world 
of Parisian physicists headed by an ambitious group leader with a 
penchant for (what else?) neutrinos. EDPSciences ISBN 2 86883 559 7

*** Totsuka wins Fujiwara Prize
</h1>
Prof.Y.Totsuka won the 2002 Fujiwara prize for "Discovery of Nu 
Oscillation from Observations of Atmospheric and Solar 
Neutrinos."  The Fujiwara prize is an annual prize given since 
1960 by the Fujiwara Science Fund to a scientist who made an 
outstanding contribution to the development of science and 
technology.  The fund was established privately by Ginjiro 
Fujiwara, the "paper-manufacturing king" of Japan.
