*** House committee approves DOE Nuclear Infrastructure Act
</h1> <p>
Although the budget is uncertain, the US House of Representatives'
Science Committee has passed a bill which directs the DOE to
construct the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility.

*** Progress Review for Fermilab's short-baseline program
</h1> <p>
An extensive document showing the motivation, design and schedule
of the Fermilab short-baseline program is at
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01520"> arXiv:1503.01520 </a>.
The
3 detector program involved MicroBoone which was already approved,
SBND which was to be built, and ICARUS which was to be moved from
CERN.  MicroBooNE is running, but while great progress has been
made on the other 2 detectors, the original schedule called for
detector cooling to finish this Dec. and that's not happening.  A
director's review in Nov. recommended a bottoms-up "Estimate to
Completion " be developed.  The physics goal is to resolve the
short-baseline anomalies suggested by LSND and MiniBooNE.

*** Tau neutrino cross section with atmospheric nus
</h1> <p>
The Super-Kamiokande experiment expects about one tau neutrino
charged current interaction from atmospheric neutrino oscillations
per kiloton year.  With 14.6 live-years of data in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.9436"> arXiv:1711.9436 </a>
they report 338 events, consistent with tau neutrino appearance.
Since m_tau/m_p &gt; 1, different structure functions matter compared
to e/mu.  Super-K excludes no-tau-appearance at 4.6 sigma, and
reports the CC cross section averaged by the flux (3.5 to 70 GeV)
to be 0.94 +- 0.20 e(-38) cm^2.  This is 1.47 +- 0.32 expectation.

*** Earl Peterson 1940-2017
</h1> <p>
Earl was one of the earliest enthusiasts for a long-baseline nu
experiment and a long-time manager of the Soudan Laboratory for
underground physics.  Earl is remembered by his students and
colleagues as someone who enjoyed physics but also enjoyed life.
Knowing him led others to enjoy their lives a bit more.  A
collection of photos of Earl can be found on facebook:

*** DOE Portfolio Review
</h1> <p>
The U.S. Department of Energy is conducting a review of currently
operating DOE/HEP supported experiments.  Glen Crawford reported
at HEPAP that ".. it was realized that if the (2018 President's)
budget was enacted as requested, it would require significant
reductions to current HEP operating experiments and associated
research, in order to preserve P5 projects at a much lower budget
level than P5 envisioned."  The 7 neutrino experiments among the
15 are Daya Bay, MicroBoone, Minerva, NA61/SHINE, NOvA, Super-K
and T2K.  The review covers running in FY2019-22.  A subpanel
report is due to HEPAP Apr 2018.

*** Ice-Cube reports earth shadow in neutrinos
</h1> <p>
Neutrinos are known to interact weakly, but the cross section
increases with energy.  A new paper by Ice-Cube, "Measurement of
the multi-TeV neutrino cross section with IceCube using Earth
absorption",
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08119"> arXiv:1711.08119 </a>,
published in Nature, gives
evidence for neutrino absorption in the earth for the first time.

*** Neutrino mass from enhanced clustering of galaxies
</h1> <p>
This group of authors, which includes one Nobel prize winner, fits
Sloan data to neutrino mass, &amp; gets the 3 neutrino mass sum to be
110 meV +- 30 meV.  Needed assumptions are stated, and the best
agreement with the inverted mass ordering is noted.  They predict
appreciable clustering enhancement in SDSS.  But one cosmologist
friend tells me robust structure formation limits on neutrino mass
are still years away.  See Emami et al. in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05210"> arXiv:1711.05210 </a>.

You can't really prove anything
in physics, but if a null 0nu2beta signal is accompanied by a
positive 0nu4beta signal, they argue at least one nu is Dirac.
