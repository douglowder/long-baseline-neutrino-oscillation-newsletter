*** Long-baseline window at CERN
</h1>A long-baseline beam at CERN cannot start to be constructed until
after LEP turns off as the transfer tunnels need to break into the
LEP tunnel.  The current schedule stops LEP in 1999 but all the LEP
experiments want to continue into 2000 and it looks like CERN will
do this.  This would mean that a long-baseline experiment to Gran
Sasso would not happen before around 2004.  On this timescale it is
likely that a long-baseline experiment will happen, possibly with
some Italian money.

*** One step towards neutrinos in Minnesota</h1>
On February 20, 1997, protons made it more than halfway down the
8 GeV transfer line from the Booster to the Main Injector.
The protons made it down a string of 74 permanent magnets, to
just about the point that the proton/neutrino beam will pass
under when the NuMI project is built.

*** Crucial Decision One for NuMI signed</h1>
Martha Krebs has signed the Justification for Mission Need, which
is simultaneously the Critical Decision 1, for NuMI. whoopla whoopla

*** New short-baseline experiment at CERN</h1>
The CERN SPSC considered a proposal from the combined CHORUS/NOMAD
groups to do a new short baseline experiment with 3 tons of emulsion
in the UA1 (NOMAD) magnet.  The timescale would be 2000-2001 and the
sensitivity is projected 2X COSMOS.  It IS likely to be approved as
it helps to fill the physics desert between LEP and LHC.

*** IMB Atmospheric neutrino study above one GeV.</h1>
A study of the zenith angle dependence of Multi-Gev events in IMB
is hampered by a hardware veto on large events in their early
data.   In an analysis of 2.1 kton-yr, they get a ratio of
fractions (f = mu/mu+e); f_data/f_MC = 1.1 + .07-.12(stat)+-.11.
The shape of the zenith angle distribution is not "oscillation
like" but errors are large.  The probability that the result is a
statistical fluctuation of the Kamiokande distribution is 5%.
Based on the shape alone, the probability is 23%.
Details are in R. Clark, Ph.D. thesis, Louisiana State 1997.

*** A neutrino oscillation puzzle to amuse you on a Saturday </h1>
A pion at rest decays into a muon and neutrino. The
neutrino oscillates between enu and munu.  We know everything
and can calculate the result of any neutrino oscillation
experiment when the source is a pion at rest.   How do we apply
these results to a pion moving with relativistic velocity. The
oscillation period goes up, because of time dilatation. But the
oscillation wavelength goes down because of the Lorentz
contraction. Which wins? Is the oscillation in time slowed down by
the time dilatation? Is the oscillation in space speeded up by the
Lorentz contraction? What happens in a real experiment with
neutrinos? In a long-baseline experiment?  (provided by H. Lipkin)
