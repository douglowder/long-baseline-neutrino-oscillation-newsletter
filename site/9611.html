*** Possible background for LSND identified and disputed
</h1>A possible new background has been identified for the LSND
experiment's signal for neutrino oscillations; it involves
neutral current Decay in F+ght (DIF) Nu interactions on 12C, +
neutrons and photons in the final state mimicking the neutron
positron coincidence signal.   The paper says this background is
negligible for E(gamma)&gt;20 MeV.  Particle ID is based on
1-particle tracks, and it is suggested that a gamma neutron pair
could mimic the 36-60 MeV e+.  But one calculation puts the rate
of this at less than 1/1000 the signal.

*** Three Neutrino Flavors are Enough for Solar, Atmo, LSND</h1>
A specific model by Pakvasa and Acker, consistent with Solar,
Atmospheric and LSND effects, (below) has lots of
predictions and positive signals for everyone.  They lower the
Boron in the sun by about 30%, and get m2 ~ 0.1eV and m3 ~ 1.4eV.
They predict no spectrum distortion for SuperK and SNO, .39 for
nu-e scattering at all energies, Borexino should see .57 SSM for
7Be, SuperK should see zenith angle dependence of numu/nue, but
mostly due to excess of high energy nue.  Chooz and Palo Verde
should see Pee ~ 0.5, MINOS, CERN-LNGS, KEK-PS, CHORUS, NOMAD
and COSMOS all get positive signals.

*** Plans for Japanese Long-baseline</h1>
US participants in Super-Kamiokande are writing a proposal to the
DOE for US participation in the Long-Baseline KEK experiment.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Fermilab reorganization</h1>
Fermilab is undergoing a major reorganization, with the Research,
Physics and Accelerator divisions being replaced by the Particle
Physics Division and the Beam Division.  The NuMI project will be
in the Beam Division.  Laura Sedlacek has become the NuMI Project
administrative support person, and Dave Pushka is the NuMI
Project engineer.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Chooz progress </h1>
The Chooz experiment has been taking calibration data with their
reactors off for several months.  The first reactor is now at
30% power.  They have a baseline of about 1km with a neutrino
energy of a few MeV.  They expect 30 neutrino events/day if there
are no oscillations, with a background of four.  The reactors
will be at full power in a few months.

*** Highlights of Frascati Neutrino Meeting</h1>
A meeting on future neutrino physics in Europe was organized by
the nuclear physics community.  The ICARUS group has started
construction of a 600 ton device, the first of maybe 10.   It will
cost 15MSwFr.  Tom Ypsilantis presented his focussing cherenkov
RICH.  The NOE group also presented their fiber detector.  Goggi
presented a status report on the neutrino beam from CERN.  They have
a design and have planned the civil construction.   The cost is around
50MSwFr just for beam and civil construction.  There is no funding
yet allocated or even foreseen in the CERN budget.  There is work going
on at CERN to define the CERN site neutrino program after Chorus/Nomad.
It is possible the two groups may combine to do a next generation
emulsion experiment.  There is also talk of a medium baseline
experiment, reviving the plan of intercepting the West area beam
in the Jura.  (20km)

*** Tony Mann new Soudan spokesman</h1>
Marvin Marshak, previous Soudan spokesman has gone on to become
the Vice-President for Academic Affairs at the University of
Minnesota.  The Soudan 2 collaboration chose Tony Mann from Tufts
as spokesman.  Peter Litchfield and Earl Peterson are deputies.

<p> </p><h1>
*** MINOS drops RPC's, forms new committees</h1>
After consideration of the technological uncertainties and R&amp;D costs
versus possible cost savings, MINOS has dropped the RPC option
for the active detector.  Meanwhile two new committees have been
formed, the Steel Oversight Committee, chaired by Lincoln Read, to
oversee steel engineering work, and the Installation Committee,
cochaired by Dave Ayres and Bill Miller to guide the installation
engineering work.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrinos down under </h1>
There was a topical workshop/conference in Adelaide at the beginning
of November. Among the talks were reports from Kamioka, SuperK,ICARUS,
NOE and MINOS. Also, the workshop involved a series of lectures aimed
at the student participants on the physics of neutrino oscillations
and its phenomenology. Overall a very useful workshop.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Solar neutrino transparencies</h1>
A collection of 23 viewgraphs on solar neutrinos are available from
John Bahcall's home page.  (Both color and black &amp; white) Others will
be added on an irregular basis.  http://www.sns.ias.edu/~jnb
He welcomes downloads of the viewgraphs if they are useful to you.

neutral currents, and this implies a large increase in the nu mean
