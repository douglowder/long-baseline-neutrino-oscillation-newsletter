*** MiniBooNE low energy excess
</H1> <P>
The MiniBooNE experiment was built to study possible solutions to
the LSND anomaly.  It found that the LSND excess could not be 
explained by 2 neutrino oscillations, but had a low energy excess 
of its own.  They have further analyzed their data, including 
1) going to lower energy (from 300 MeV to 200 MeV);  2) a refined 
treatment of pi flux errors from HARP; 3) additional hadronic 
backgrounds in MC,  4) additional cuts against nu interactions in 
the dirt and  5) more data.  Some of these increase the effect, 
some reduce it, but the bottom line is that there is still an 
excess at low energy, more than 3 sigma, that remains a mystery.

*** Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino in China gets US approval
</H1> <P>
Daya Bay received DOE CD-3B  approval at the beginning August.  US
collaborators are excited to be able to start the construction.

*** Neutrino Rhymes
</H1> <P>
Chris Walter summarized the state of neutrino physics at ICHEP
this summer, and ended with the following poem:
Chris Walter summarized the state of neutrino physics at ICHEP

<i>
  "We must pity the student in his deep dark hole,
<br>  Whose thesis depends on that one monopole,
<br>  Or on solar neutrinos that wriggle about,
<br>  Unless they are saying our sun has gone out -- S. Glashow"
<br>  These words come from Glashow, we know they are true
<br>  For he's been to Stockholm, unlike me and you.
<br>  Who is this legion, so dirty & weary?
<br>  Sad underground physicists, unfit to do theory.
<br>  So gladly we march to mines, tunnels or seas.
<br>  New physics or not, we get Ph.D's
<br>  Condensed to a preprint we mail to our mothers.
<br>  Of one page of physics, two pages of authors.

*** Neutrino Rap?
</H1> <P>
An exceedingly well done rap video about the physics of the
LHC and particle physics in general is making the rounds

Neutrinos are not mentioned, providing an opportunity for a
clever neutrino physicist to fill this gap.

*** NEXT experiment approved for CanFranc (SPAIN)
</H1> <P>
NEXT (Neutrino Xenon TPC) is a new experiment proposed to the 
CanFranc scientific committee and has been approved to build a 100 
kg gas-Xenon TPC at a pressure of 10 bar. It obtained 5+ million 
euro financing from a special grant.  Gas is a competitive option 
for neutrinoless double beta decay, since one can observe the two 
tracks.  NEXT hopes to be at the same time competitive and
complementary to EXO (also using Xenon).  It will be in an initial 
phase of R&D during 2 years to decide the technology (micromegas, 
APDs, PMT a la XENON...) and will construct a first prototype 
(NEXT-10 ) in 3 years, followed by NEXT-100 in 5.

*** TAUP 2009
</H1> <P>
The Eleventh International Conference on Topics in Astroparticle 
and Underground Physics (TAUP 2009) will be held at the Laboratori 
Nazionali del Gran Sasso on July 1-5, 2009. The Conference website 
will be taup2009.lngs.infn.it.  The topics of the Conference are: 
Cosmology and Particle Physics, Dark Matter and Dark Energy, 
Gravitational Waves, Neutrino Physics and Astrophysics, High Energy 
Astrophysics and Cosmic Rays

*** Neutrissimos
</H1> <P>
Neutrissimos are not-so-heavy-neutral-heavy-leptons with potential 
mass between ~10 keV and ~100 GeV which can mix with the light 
neutrinos.     They appear in many new models for neutrino mass.   
They may be difficult to observe at LHC, because of low production 
rates. They could be detected through a shift in the weak mixing 
angle measurements of neutrino-quark and neutrino-electron 
scattering experiments.   Also, for the lightest neutrissimos, one 
can search for their direct production in meson decay using the 
signature of the neutrissimo decay.   Francois Vannucci will 
discussed this search-method at a Fermilab Wine and Cheese 5 Sep. 

<H1>
*** SciBooNE finishes run
</H1> <P>
SciBooNE's 14 months of data-taking provided quantities of data 
that will lead to never-before-recorded measurements of neutrinos 
and anti neutrinos at low energies. These data will increase the 
efficiency of other neutrino research, including the next-
generation experiment T2K in Japan.

*** NOvA FONSI
</H1> <P>
The NOvA long-baseline neutrino project at FNAL passed its 
environmental review.  It was issued its Environmental Assessment 
and "finding of no significant impact" or FONSI, which indicates 
that environmental issues were studied & there are no big issues.
