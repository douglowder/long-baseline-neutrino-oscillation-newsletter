*** Neutrino 2022 talks and videos available online + 657 posters
</h1> <p>
The 50th anniversary program is available, but still only for
registerants.

*** Neutrino 2072 preview
</h1> <p>
Neutrino 2022 started with a look back at Neutrino 1972 by Chris
Quigg and included a look forward to the possible highlights of
Neutrino 2072.  A few were:  "The study of leptonic CP violation
will take on a life of its own; the connection to leptogenesis
remains psychological", "Large-scale experiments will hint that
some neutrinos decay", and "Detection of cosmogenic neutrinos
will fix birth of the first stars".

*** Neutrino Physicist interviewed about Russia's Ukraine invasion
</h1> <p>
There are many outstanding neutrino physicists from Russia.
DESY's Christian Spiering, who has worked at Lake Baikal and
initiated the Global Neutrino Network, has collaborated with
Russian researchers for almost fifty years.  Here he discusses his
thoughts on the effects on research due to their Ukraine war.

*** Francesco Lanni chosen to lead Neutrino Platform at CERN
</h1> <p>
His goal is to help shape the long-term perspective for neutrino
physics at CERN.  Current activities include protoDUNE, proof of
principle for vertical drift, and making 2 cryostats for
LBNF/DUNE.

*** Fiscal Year 2023 US LBNF/DUNE budget request
</h1> <p>
Funding for LBNF/DUNE in FY22 rises slowly, $173M to $189M &amp; $180M
in 2023. That aligns with a “conservative” funding profile floated
by the DOE last year to address ballooning costs as well as the
need to fund LHC upgrades. DOE is currently using an estimate of
$3B for the overall cost, with international contributions valued
at $660M more.  Firm costs will come in 2023 at the earliest.

*** Elaine McCluskey, LBNF Project Manager, announces retirement
</h1> <p>
Her management work on neutrino experiments, recently as project
manager for LBNF, has helped turn Fermilab into a neutrino lab.

*** Tom Gaisser 1941-2022
</h1> <p>
Delaware theorist Thomas K Gaisser played an important role in the
discovery of neutrino oscillations by providing one of the flux
calculations for atmospheric neutrinos seen by IMB, Kamiokande,
Soudan 2 and Frejus.  He has recently been an active member of the
IceCube collaboration including spokesperson.

And in May,
the Davis Campus at Sanford Underground Research Facility was
recognized for its contributions to the advancement of physics.

</p><ul>
<li> "Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering: Terrestrial and
astrophysical applications",
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07361"> arXiv:2203.07361 </a>
This discusses the
neutrino sources that can be used to detect CEνNS, beyond Standard
Model searches and on-going and future experiments.
</li><li> "The Physics Case for a Neutrino Factory",
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08094"> arXiv:2203.08094 </a>
Given its unique beam characteristics, it could new nu states,
light dark matter, lepton-flavor universality violation, etc.  The
ability to study nu energies in the range of ~tens of GeV opens
the possibility for nutau physics and charm production.
</li><li> "SoLAr: Solar Neutrinos in Liquid Argon",
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07501"> arXiv:2203.07501 </a>
The
goal of SoLAr is to observe solar neutrinos in a 10 ton detector &amp;
demonstrate the required background suppression and E resolution.
It will lead to  precision on flux measurements and nu mixing
parameters, and ultimately observation of hep neutrinos.
</li><li> "Japan’s Strategy for Future Projects in High Energy Physics",
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13979"> arXiv:2203.13979 </a>
Besides a linear collider, Hyper-Kamiokande is
currently under construction to study CP symmetry in the lepton
sector as well as nucleon decays. In the meantime searches for CP
violation will continue with T2K and upgrades of the J-PARC beams.
</li><li> "Physics Opportunities with PROSPECT-II",
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12343"> arXiv:2202.12343 </a>
Focusing on the future use of reactor neutrinos for BSM physics,
good spectral measurements have a role. Recent results have
confused the landscape. PROSPECT-II features an evolutionary
design which can be constructed and deployed within a year
