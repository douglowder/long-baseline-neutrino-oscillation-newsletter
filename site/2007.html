*** Final item in Long-Baseline news on Neutrino 2020 meeting
</h1> <p>
Highlights from the successful Nu 2020 meeting and its excursion
into virtual reality were nicely summarized in the CERN Courier

for the neutrino-based
"Physics Slam".  I don't think neutrinos are mysterious.

*** Final long-baseline results from MINOS and MINOS+
</h1> <p>
The MINOS long-baseline program, the original motivation for this
newsletter, ran from  2005 to 2016.  It accumulated 23.6e20 pot &amp;
61 kt-yr of atmospheric neutrinos.  Combined best fit for Normal
Order is dmsq_32 = 2.40 + 0.08 - 0.09 e-3 eV^2 and sin^2(theta23)
= 0.43 (0.39 to 0.63).  It disfavors maximal mixing (.91 sigma),
and prefers lower octant (.55 sigma) &amp;  normal order (.45 sigma).
The data from its search for sterile neutrinos is consistent with
3-flavor paradigm &amp; in a joint fit with Daya Bay excludes large
regions of 3+1 parameter space.

*** MiniBooNE Oscillation Results with Final Dataset
</h1> <p>
With 6e20 protons on target more than previously published,
MiniBooNE, which ran from 2002-2019, has a stable low-energy
nue-like excess.  The radial distribution disfavors a source
from dirt events or pizero background.  See
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16883"> arXiv:2006.16883 </a>.
Non-
oscillation explanations are considered by Brdar et al. in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14411"> arXiv:2007.14411 </a>.
Twenty scenarios are considered there, but data
from other experiments rule out most of them.

*** Final datataking on Borexino in 2020
</h1> <p>
With its discovery of neutrinos from the CNO cycle in the sun and
its previous measurement of the pp-cycle neutrinos, Borexino has
"completely unraveled the two processes powering the Sun."  They
have also measured geoneutrinos.  There are plans to shut down
Borexino, which has been taking data since 2007, and dismantle at
the end of 2020.  Large Volume Detector (LVD) will also shutdown.

*** Final datataking from Daya Bay in 2020
</h1> <p>
The Daya Bay  experiment studying neutrinos from nuclear reactors
since December 2011 is taking data through the pandemic and will
keep running until the end of 2020.    They have the most precise
measurement of theta13 and expect a final precision of 2.7%.  They
have observed reactor fuel evolution and disfavor a sterile nu
explanation of the reactor antineutrino anomaly.

*** Final run of ProtoDUNE-SP Phase 1 and first results
</h1> <p>
The Single Phase Liquid Argon Prototype at CERN for DUNE ended
its run on 19 July 2020.  It studied liquid argon purity, took
test beam events, tested high voltage systems, and successfully
tested an injection of Xenon (13.5 kG for 18.8 ppm in mass).  Xe
shifts 128 nm wavelength to 175 nm which increases the Rayleigh
scattering length to increase uniformity &amp; light yield.  Results
on ProtoDUNE performance can be found in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06722"> arXiv:2007.06722 </a>.

*** Not the final issue of long-baseline newsletter
</h1> <p>
I do not have a schedule for ending this newsletter, but it will
end sometime.  In the past, I was more involved in planning some
neutrino experiments than I am now, so I welcome input to help
inform the ~2500 subscribers.  There is more nu news than formerly
but I'll keep the length &lt;112 lines of ASCII text.  Subscribe/
unsubscribe requests will be honored, or use the FNAL listserver.

*** rant - neutrinos are not ghosts
</h1> <p>
Ghosts have the well known property that they stand on the floor
but can go through walls.  This was a good metaphor for nus in the
1950's, but I dislike describing our favorite particles as
"ghostlike".  Furthermore, they are hardly elusive.  I would call
them ubiquitous.  Experiments measure them from many sources with
better signal/background than most collider searches.

*** Snowmass moves Neutrino Theory from Neutrino to Theory
</h1> <p>
"In reviewing the course of the Snowmass 21 process to date (the
Theory and Neutrino Frontier conveners) realized that the current
state of affairs in relation to the Neutrino Theory topical group
was entirely unintentional. We therefore decided to transfer the
Neutrino Theory topical group (NF08) with its current conveners to
the Theory Frontier as topical group Neutrino Theory (TF11). The
liaisons will stay in place, but will now liaise from TF to NF."

*** Could you make a snowball with neutrinos?
</h1> <p>
This question was sent to the New York Times.  The answer was
"good question."

There was a July meeting to form a new international collaboration
towards development of a muon collider.  Contact Mark Palmer
