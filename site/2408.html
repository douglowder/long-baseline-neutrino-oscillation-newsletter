This nice article, which covered the front page of the NYT
Science Section, describes some of the scientists working on
DUNE at Sanford Lab.  The link might require a subscription.

*** DUNE Phase II White paper available in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12725"> arXiv:2408.12725 </A>
</H1> <P>
While the construction of the DUNE Phase I is well underway, this
White Paper focuses on DUNE Phase II planning. DUNE Phase-II
consists of a third and fourth far detector (FD) module, an
upgraded near detector complex, and an enhanced 2.1 MW beam.

*** NOvA reports on a sterile neutrino search in the 3+1 Model
</H1> <P>
In 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04553"> arXiv:2409.04553, </A>
the NOvA experiment reports a negative
search for sterile neutrinos using a dual baseline.  Using
13.6e20 protons on target, and CC and NC events, new limits are
set on delta msquared_41.  Also stringent limits on anomalous
nutau appearance below 3 eV^2.

Bj was an early advocate of long-baseline neutrino experiments, &
was the prime theoretical speaker at the November 1991 Workshop on
long-baseline neutrino oscillation.  Back in 1994, the Drell panel
was charting the future of High Energy Physics after the demise of
the SSC. This is a portion of a letter that Bj wrote to the panel,
"...I think the appropriate solution to this problem is for
Fermilab to aggressively expand and diversify its scientific
progress. Even glaciers are known to undergo surges, where the
flow unexpectedly quickens for a while to an extraordinary
degree..There is plenty of motivation for a long-baseline neutrino
oscillation experiment, but it is caught in the glacier despite
PAC/lab in- principle endorsement."  Now this is the core of FNAL.

John played a decisive role in the UK/US Soudan2 search for proton
decay which also contributed to the discovery of atmospheric
neutrino oscillations. This called for the continuous fine-grained
observation of a 1000 tons half a mile deep in Minnesota for over
a decade. John’s revolutionary design worked well, and although
the experiment found no evidence for proton decay, the observed
background of neutrinos passing right through the Earth showed
evidence for flavor oscillations. This provided important support
for other experiments based on Cherenkov signals in water.

Among his many other accomplishments, T.D. Lee is given credit for the idea of
neutrino beams.  
Following a suggestion in the theory paper by Lee and Yang,
Lederman, Schwartz, and Steinberger verified that there are 2 different 
neutrinos in 1962 and won their Nobel Prize in 1988. 
In his Nobel Lecture, Schwartz recalled: “The Columbia University 
Physics Department had a tradition of a coffee hour …… At one of 
these Professor T. D. Lee was leading such a discussion of the 
possibilities for investigating weak interactions at high 
energies. …… That evening the key notion came to me …… I called 
T. D. Lee at home with the news and his enthusiasm was overwhelming. 
The next day planning for the experiment began in earnest”. 
Schwartz also gratefully mentioned in Nobel Prize webpage: “T.D. Lee …... was the inspirer of this 
experiment”. And in Lederman's  
Nobel Banquet Speech: “We are also agreed that we owe much to 
many others, and I would like to mention Professor T. D. Lee, 
our Columbia colleague, for his guidance and inspiration."
