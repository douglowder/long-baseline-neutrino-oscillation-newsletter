*** T2K sees nue appearance with antineutrinos
</h1> <p>
T2K is reporting seeing 3 e-like events in their anti-neutrino run
on a background of 1.8 (the 1.8 includes 0.6 events from the wrong
sign appearance channel).

*** Reconfigure,check; reformulate,check; refresh, check.
</h1> <p>
The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) underwent a
CD1-refresh, taking into account the increased scope from the
formation of a collaboration to undertake the first international
mega-project in the United States.  Closeout slides, in which
they answered "yes" to every question in the charge (which is a
good outcome) can be found at

*** NOvA data coming soon
</h1> <p>
This off-axis long-baseline neutrino experiment from Fermilab to
Northern Minnesota has gobs of data.  An analysis of most of that
data will be presented at a "wine and cheese" seminar at Fermilab
on 6 August and at the DPF meeting in Ann Arbor the next day.
It should be able to say whether or not it is seeing electron
neutrino appearance, sensitive to theta_13, and muon neutrino
disappearance, sensitive to theta_23.  It will keep running as the
NuMI power increases, and in a few years with gobs and gobs
more data it can say something about the mass ordering if lucky.

*** MicroBooNE has "first light"
</h1> <p>
MicroBooNE is a large Liquid Ar Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC)
neutrino experiment located along the Booster neutrino beam line
at Fermilab.  The experiment will measure low energy neutrino
cross sections and investigate the low energy excess events
observed by the MiniBooNE experiment.  On 9 July, it  reached a
major milestone when filling of the LArTPC was completed, which
required 9 tanker trucks and ~34,000 gallons of high purity
liquid Ar.  Commissioning of the detector is currently underway.

*** Neutrino agreement for Joe Biden and Dilma Rousseff
</h1> <p>
The Brazil Minister of Science, Technology &amp; Innovation Rebelo
signed a statement of intent that promotes collaborative R&amp;D in
neutrino physics with the US DOE.  It took place during lunch
hosted by VP Joe Biden in honor of President Dilma Rousseff during
her official visit to the U.S.  The document recalls that Brazil
and the US have many decades of collaboration in HEP. Brazil has
several working groups studying neutrinos and the US DOE considers
this field a priority for its future particle physics program.

*** Ordering Neutrino parameters, NO and IO
</h1> <p>
We label the neutrino mass states according to the size of the nue
i.e. by definition  |U_e1|^2 &gt; |U_e2|^2&gt; |U_e3|^2. Nu_1 and nu_2
have a mass squared splitting equal to the ~7.6 10^-5 eV^2 and the
order of these 2 was determined by the SNO experiment, m_2 &gt; m_1.
The mass eigenstate nu_3 has mass^2 splitting of ~2.5 10^-3 eV^2
from nu_1 and n_2 but whether it's mass is greater or smaller than
m_1 and m_2  is undetermined.  So if we order the masses from
lightest to heaviest we have 2 possible orderings: m_1 &lt; m_2 &lt; m_3
(normal ordering NO) or m_3 &lt; m_1 &lt; m_2 (inverted ordering IO).
Therefore this ordering question is important whether the masses
are hierarchical or quasi-degenerate or anything in between.  Mass
ordering is the preferred terminology over mass hierarchy so as to
avoid confusion with the another important question of whether the
mass spectrum is hierarchical or quasi-degenerate.

*** New director for LBNF
</h1> <p>
A new deputy director at Fermilab will focus on the Long-Baseline
Neutrino Facility.  The position is being filled by Chris Mossey,
a retired and decorated rear admiral in the United States Navy.

*** Another Neutrino Day
</h1> <p>
On 11 July 2015 another neutrino day was celebrated, focusing on
the fact that it is the 50th anniversary of Ray Davis starting
to construct his neutrino detector at the Homestake mine.
