*** SAGENAP meets</h1>
The Scientific Assessment Group for Experiments in
Non-Accelerator Physics met for 2 days in DC to hear progress
reports from ten DOE proposals and experiments in Non-Accelerator
Physics.   Included were:  DUMAND which needs $300K to finish the
strings and repair the junction box, and $200K to install; CDMS
(Cold Dark Matter Search) which is running now near Stanford and
whose leading candidate for a deep site  (early '98?) is Soudan;
SuperK, which is due to start April 1, but had some cute data with
2.5 meters of water in the tank; and Soudan 2 and MACRO which
showed recent results.

*** NOE and RICH submit Gran Sasso documents</h1>
Letter's of Intent for Long-Baseline experiments from CERN to
Gran Sasso were submitted around New-Year's.  The RICH document
describes the optics which can be achieved using that kind of
detector, and the event rates which can then be expected from a
27 kton water detector.  The NOE document covers many topics,
including the results of a calorimeter prototype test, and
calculations of long-baseline oscillation tests using both
statistical searches and direct nutau appearance searches.

*** COSMOS chooses lead glass Electromagnetic Calorimeter</h1>
The choices were a gas system, scintillator or Pb-glass.

*** Nue Mass upper limit shoots up</h1>
Neutrino mass best fits from direct neutrino experiments continue
to be statistically negative m-squared.  In such a situation,
upper limits on m with 95%CL (presently 7 eV) are probably
meaningless.  For its next edition, the particle data group has
decided to drop all such limits and use the electron neutrino
mass limit from Supernova 1987a, about 25 eV.

*** One of MINOS's leaders, Wonyong Lee, wins award</h1>
Wonyong Lee has won Korea's most prestigious award, the Ho-Am Prize,
for his work in particle physics.   The prize, valued at $110K, will
be awarded March 22 in Seoul by the Samsung Welfare Foundation.  The
Samsung Welfare Foundation was established in 1989 in memory of the
late Byung-Chull Lee, founder of the Samsung Group, the world's 14th
largest corporation with interests in electronics, machinery,
chemicals, finance, insurance and other areas.   Dr. Lee was cited
for his "monumental contributions to the advancement of high energy
particle physics."

*** HERA improves AGN limits from past and future nu detectors</h1>
The measurement of the highest energy neutrinos from AGN's can be
estimated but cross sections of course have not been measured.
The rise in low x structure functions measured by HERA has
allowed improved estimates of these cross sections, which are now
higher for E &gt; a few TeV (see reference Gandhi et al.)  This results
in improved AGN limits for experiments which measured or limited a
fixed muon flux at high energies.  The improvement is about 2.5.

*** Hypothesis testing versus parameter fitting, atmospheric nus</h1>
Experiments report a ratio of ratios, called R.  Due to
misidentification and neutral currents, it is not really a
numu/nue ratio.  For R=1, this is corrected by the Monte Carlo,
so any R.neq.1 is evidence against the null hypothesis.  Remember
that errors aren't Gaussian, but each experiment can test the
null hypothesis by showing an R.  But don't expect each
experiment to measure the same R if R.neq.1!  Each experiment
has different misidentification and neutral current
backgrounds.  Thus quoted R's from different experiments could
be different, until a further correction is made which in effect
takes into account a Monte Carlo for R = R(measured).  Such
corrections can be a big fraction of 1-R.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Hypothesis testing versus parameter fitting, solar nus</h1>
The Beryllium neutrinos are missing, but only in a world where
there is no new neutrino physics and all of the experiments are
right.  Since the sun presumably needs Beryllium to make Boron,
no one believes in such a world.  This statement is used as part
of a hypothesis test of the combined standard solar and
electroweak model, and shows that something new beyond the null
hypothesis is needed.  That something does not have to imply that
Beryllium neutrinos are missing.  At the Coral Gables conference,
Lincoln Wolfenstein showed a model with oscillations in which the
nue flux from Boron is down by 80%, and most of the Gallium and
Chlorine neutrinos are due to Beryllium 7.
