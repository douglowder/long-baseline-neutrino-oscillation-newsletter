*** CERN switches on new neutrino beam
</H1>
CERN has a press release about the CNGS beam (CERN neutrinos to
Gran Sasso).  Also see a 3 minute movie on making a neutrino beam.

*** Fermilab $26M plans for protons for neutrinos - "proton plan"
</H1>
The "Proton Plan" represents a multi-year campaign to increase the
proton intensity delivered to the 120 GeV & 8 GeV neutrino beams,
with upgrades to the LINAC, Booster and Main Injector.  Once the
elements of this plan are completed, NuMI will accumulate ~3.2E20
protons/year.  The 8 GeV beamline will receive ~1.8E20 p/year.
The preliminary estimate for the total cost of this plan, including
tasks & milestones to address the serious vulnerability issue with
LINAC amplifier tubes.  Costs are included for alleviating concerns
for the availability of these tubes in the short-term, and for
developing a plan for the long-term.  Similarly, costs are included
to determine the repetition rate limitation in the Booster and to
develop a plan to exceed this limit, if appropriate.  These two 
long-term plans, when accepted, will require significant addition
to the present scope.  DOE's FY06 NuMI goal of 1.0E20 p's was met.

*** BBC's University Challenge too challenging?
</H1>
Last month's show had a short section on neutrinos, including:
"In the MINOS experiment neutrinos are fired 450 miles and are
detected in the Soudan mine.  In what US state is the Soudan mine?"
The students (Girton College, Cambridge) didn't have a clue.

<H1>
*** SciBooNE groundbreaking
</H1>
They are moving the scibar detector from K2K to put in the 8 GeV 
neutrino beam at Fermilab, but they need a hole to put it in.

*** Double Chooz reactor neutrino experiment press release
</H1>
In a Joint press release from French agencies CEA/DAPNIA and
CNRS/IN2P3, the initial construction of the Double Chooz reactor
neutrino experiment was announced.  Two identical detectors are to
be installed near the Chooz nuclear power plant, in the Ardennes.

*** KASKA reactor neutrino experiment turned down
</H1>
The proposed reactor neutrino experiment at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa
nuclear power plants has been turned down by the Japanese funding
agencies.  This is the site of seven nuclear reactors, and is the
point on earth with the highest neutrino flux.  Members of KASKA
have joined the Double Chooz experiment.  KASKA will continue the
effort to realize a future reactor neutrino experiment in Japan,
with a sensitivity to sin^2 w theta-13 better than .01, and thinks
that participation in Double Chooz is useful for future projects.

<H1>
*** International Scoping Studies on Neutrino Facilities
</H1>
The final report of the Scoping Study (ISS) will be issued by the 
end of the year. The transition to International Design Studies 
(IDSs) of the different options, Superbeam(s), Neutrino Factory, 
Betabeam, is now the goal, as defined at Nufact06.  Each design 
study should produce, over a few years: 1) a complete end-to-end 
feasibility study of its option, with a the level of engineering
necessary for a conceptual design; 2) solutions of the most 
critical technical problems by means of a set of international R&D 
demonstration experiments like MUCOOL, HARP, MICE, MERIT... The 
next ISS/IDS meeting will be at CERN on 21-22 Feb.  As emphasized
by the recent EPP2010 report and CERN Strategy Document among 
others, this can only be a truly global effort.  Collaborators are 
in all regions (U.S. Nu Factory Collaboration, European BENE Network, 
Nufact-J Working Group and others (India, Russia ...).

*** Borexino filled
</H1>
Borexino has been inflated and filled with water.  They hope to
fill with scintillator early next year.

<H1>
*** Super-Kamiokande filled again
</H1>
The Super-Kamiokande rebuild is finished and they have filled the
detector, calibrated it and are taking physics runs now.  They are
back to the phototube coverage they had before the accident.

*** Deep Science draft at 
<A href="http://www.dusel.org/">http://www.dusel.org/
</A>
</H1>
This is a "high level document" prepared in conjunction wit the
Solicitation One NSF effort for a deep lab in the U.S.  This draft
document outlines the science that can be done in a deep lab.

<H1>
*** Nuclear Neutrino Town Meeting in Santa Fe
</H1>
In preparation for the nuclear physics town meetings that will focus
on discussions concerning the Long Range Plan, there will be a pre-
town meeting for neutrino physics in Santa Fe on 18-19 Nov.  The
objective is to put together a framework for neutrino physics and an
outline or draft for the white paper that will be fleshed out at the
Fundamental Symmetries and Neutrinos Town Meeting at Argonne,
19-21 Jan 07.  Contact
