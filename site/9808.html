*** Discover of Neutrino, Fred Reines, passes away
</h1>Dr. Reines died last week in Orange California after a long
illness.  Working with Dr. Clyde Cowan, he used the Savannah
River nuclear reactor to produce neutrinos and a tank of water
as the detector in the 1950's.  This won the 1995 Nobel prize.
Reines' most recent paper was as one of 121 authors of "Evidence
for oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos",

*** NGS Report released by CERN
</h1>The CERN neutrino beam design effort is called "NGS" for the CERN
Neutrino beam to Gran Sasso.   The report
<a href="http://preprints.cern.ch/cernrep/1998/98-02/98-02.html">
(CERN 98-02 and
INFN/AE-98/05) </a> outlines the proposed facility consisting of a new
neutrino beam directed from CERN to Gran Sasso and an underground
area for neutrino physics 2 km from the source at the boundary of
Geneva airport.  The experimental area near CERN with a
short-baseline experiment will complement the long-baseline
program at Gran Sasso.   The NGS draft schedule presented in the
report assumes that funding would be available to start the civil
engineering construction in October 1998.  This is known not to
be the case.  A new draft schedule, with NGS beam staring early
in 2003, is being prepared.

*** Hep neutrinos might explain the solar nu energy spectrum
</h1>If the low energy cross section for 3He+p -&gt; 4He e+ nue is 20
times larger than the best (but uncertain) theoretical estimates,
then the observed Super-Kamiokande spectrum agrees well with the
MSW fits.  This is quantified in
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-ph/9807525"> hep-ph/9807525 </a>
.  Other
solutions are quantified in
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-ph/9807216"> hep-ph/9807216; </a>
small angle MSW acceptable
at 7%CL, (8% for sterile nu's), vacuum solution ok at 6%.
Best MSW fit for actives is 5 10^-6 eV^2, 5.5 10^-3 mixing.

*** Macro Upward Muon results published
</h1>Submitted to Physical Review,
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-ex/9807005"> hep-ex/9807005 </a>
reports that the
ratio of the number observed to expected events integrated over
zenith is 0.74 +- 0.036(stat) +- 0.046(syst) +- 0.13(theory).
The shape does not fit no-oscillations (P~0.1%)  The rate fits
neutrino oscillations well with large mixing and dmsq ~ 2 10^-3
eV^2, but the shape doesn't fit well.  Maximum P is for same
dmsq but is only about 5%.  P combined is 17%.  They conclude
the data favor neutrino oscillations but with unexplained
structure in the zenith distribution.

*** NuMI/MINOS reviews winding down (for this year)
</h1>After two director's reviews, a physics review, and several
project reviews, MINOS is preparing for a Lehman review, now
scheduled on election day in early November.  Soudan 2 is
preparing for the blasting of the MINOS cavity, oblivious to
reports that the US government had bombed a facility in Sudan.

*** Neutrino Oscillations and Charge quantization
</h1>The charge quantization problem depends on the conservation of
the family lepton numbers.   Since neutrino oscillation
experiments search for family lepton number violation, they also
indirectly probe the charge quantization problem.  The Super-
Kamiokande atmospheric neutrino data explain electric charge
quantization provided that numu to nutau oscillations induced by a
Majorana mass are their explanation.  See Foot/Volkas ref below.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Is neutrino mass "a bit bizarre?"
</h1>Georgi and Glashow take six plausible "facts" and constrain the
neutrino mass matrix to have a form that they find "both
fascinating and a bit bizarre." With 1) 3 and only 3 Majorana
masses, 2) Little atmospheric numu to nue, 3) large atmospheric
mixing, 4) MSW or just-so solar neutrinos, 5) Neutrino masses
just large enough to play a significant cosmological role (1% of
the dark matter) and 6) no neutrinoless double beta decay.  They
are led by 5) (the least well-established "fact")  to nearly
degenerate neutrinos with interesting symmetries.  See ref below.

*** What Is Measured in Real Neutrino Oscillation Experiments?
</h1>"A neutrino wave incident on a detector has a finite length - and
passes the detector in a finite time interval. The square of the
wave amplitude at time t gives the probability of detection at
time t. But quantum mechanics tells us that the exact time of the
detection within the time interval when the wave passes the
detector is unpredictable! And measuring this exact time tells us
nothing about the wave except that some piece of it was at the
detector at that time. So all theories which try to use this time,
transit time or proper time have nothing to do with the real world,
and their conclusions are usually wrong!" For discussion at
