<H1>Long-Baseline news, November 2022 </H1>
<P> 


<H1>
*** Snowmass neutrino frontier report
</H1> <P>
It is available at 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08641"> arXiv:2211.08641. </A>
It concludes that DUNE is
the flagship international experiment. It will fill in gaps of
the 3-flavor picture and explore new BSM territory, as well as be
open to astrophysical signal opportunities. Beyond DUNE, the
community has sent a clear message that a broad neutrino program
across scales, connecting to other Frontiers and fields, is
highly desirable for maximizing science output.

<H1>
*** Why did the neutrino detector cross the lab?
</H1> <P>
The SBND detector was built at Fermilab's D-zero building, and
will run in the Booster Neutrino Beam.  So the correct answer is
to get to the other side.  It received helicopter news coverage
while a party raged across the Fermilab campus.  See

*** Why do theorists make predictions?
</H1> <P>
Theorists often make postdictions, i.e. they try to explain some
unexpected experimental result by adding some new physics to the
current paradigm.  But if they predict the value of a previously
unmeasured parameter, that has added interest.  
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04546"> arXiv:2211.04546 </A>
by Ding et al. finds the mixing angle sin^2(q23) and the Dirac CP
phase δ are predicted in the ranges 0.504-0.510 & 1.316π-1.364π
respectively. They use a modular nu model with few parameters.

<H1>
*** Why do neutrino physicists go to school?
</H1> <P>
The 14th International Neutrino Summer School (INSS)  will be at
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois from
7-18 August 2023.  It will cover theoretical and experimental
aspects of neutrino physics, including neutrino oscillations,
accelerator and reactor nus, solar and atmospheric nus, nu cross
sections, nu mass models, and nus in cosmology and astrophysics.
Applications are now open and will close on 31 March 2023.

*** What is new in the 2022 version of the Particle Data Book?
</H1> <P>
In the neutrino sections, there were 86 measurements from 48
papers added.  Highlights include new limits on the half-life
for neutrinoless double beta decays in 130Te, 100Mo and 76Ge.

<H1>
*** What is the Awkward Material Transport Team (AMTT)?
</H1> <P>
If you work underground, taking everything down a shaft can be an
issue, but if you design things right, it is not really a
limitation.  The first anode plane assemblies (APA) from
Manchester have arrived at the Sanford Underground Research
Facility, the first DUNE science components to arrive at SURF.

*** What is Africa doing in neutrino physics?
</H1> <P>
At the moment, it is up to Madagascar.

*** DOE Nuclear Physics long-range plan town hall 14 December
</H1> <P>
DOE Office of Science Nuclear Physics (NP) is formulating its
decadal Long-Range plan and has a town hall for the Fundamental
Symmetries sub-program on 14 December 2022. During Snowmass 2021,
many HEP and NP scientists jointly promoted the science and many
theory efforts and experiments targeting fundamental symmetries &
BSM physics being funded by NP.  These include 0nu2beta decay,
neutron EDM, neutron lifetime and decay asymmetries, and joint
efforts on nu-nucleus scattering (DUNE and SBN) & CKM unitarity
tests.  The Snowmass nu frontier prepared an executive summary and
seeks endorsement from the HEP community for the Fundamental
symmetries sub-program committee of NP to support their efforts.

*** The SuperChooz Experiment, unveiling the Opportunity.
</H1> <P>
At CERN, 
<A href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/1215214/">
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1215214/,
</A>
an idea for a new
reactor neutrino experiment was presented, utilizing 2 reactors,
an underground site available from the dismantling of the EDF
Chooz-A reactor, and the LiquidO technology.

<H1>
