*** Robots for Liquid Argon - Argonaut
</H1> <P>
Neither Richard Branson nor Jeff Bezos will ever be Argonauts.
But that appellation will be used for a robotic system  being
developed to work inside liquid argon detectors, such as DUNE,
MicroBooNE, ICARUS, SBND and others.  Components will have to 
work in both a cryogenic environment and around high voltage.

*** Data for NOvA module in charged particle test beam
</H1> <P>
NOvA has placed two 31-plane 2.6 m x 2.6 m blocks in a new FNAL
tertiary charged particle test beam.  The purpose is to measure
particle response in NOvA modules & a check of energy calibration.
There are electrons, muons, pions, protons and kaons with known
momentum in the beam.  There has been two data-taking periods with
>5k events in year 1 and >16K in year 2.  A problem with
underfilling of the top horizontal cells due to a slight tilt was
fixed during year 2 and analysis of the data is ongoing. An
additional beam run in early 2022 is being considered.

<H1>
*** Current NOvA beam sets new record
</H1> <P>
A new NuMI beam intensity record, 843 kW average power for
1 hour, was set on 15 June.  The summer shutdown started 27 June.
During 2021 the average power was 680 kW.

<H1>
*** Future NOvA beam running
</H1> <P>
NOvA is expected to run till January of 2027 when there will be a 
long shutdown for LBNF and PIP-II.  NOvA has analyzed 26e20 pot
of the ~37e20 pot taken through the shutdown.  Through 2027 NOvA
expects a total of 60-70 e20 pot, about double the current total.

<H1>
*** Golden Particle Awards win the physics slam, but...
</H1> <P>
Neutrinos got one nomination but didn't win any awards.  I haven't
been so stunned since the Bee Gees weren't nominated for an Oscar
for Saturday Night Fever.  DUNE won (actually ProtoDUNE) & ICARUS
had a nomination.

*** Patricia Vahle & Mayly Sanchez APS fellows for neutrino work
</H1> <P>
Sanchez was cited for "significant contributions to experimental
neutrino physics, in particular for conducting measurements of
long-baseline neutrino oscillations, and for leadership in
advancing novel neutrino detection techniques with the ANNIE
experiment."  Vahle was cited for "leading contributions to the
measurements of neutrino oscillations using (MINOS and NOvA)".

*** NuFACT 2021 still seeking posters for 6-11 Sep. meeting
</H1> <P>
NuFACT 2021: The 22nd International Workshop on Neutrinos from
Accelerators will be a hybrid in-person/virtual meeting in Sardinia
Italy.  The oral agenda is being finalized, but contributions for
the poster sessions are still being accepted.  Registration is
free for virtual non-speakers.  See

"CMB-HD: An Ultra-Deep, High-Resolution mm-Wave
Survey Over Half the Sky", It would measure the number of light
particle species that were in thermal equilibrium with the known
standard-model particles at any time in the early Universe, i.e.
Neff, with a 1-sigma uncertainty of 0.014.

"Lattice Calculation of Neutrino-Nucleon Cross Section"
The (chi)QCD Collaboration (part of the the USQCD Collab) plans to
carry out a lattice calculation of the nu-nucleon scattering cross
section for the neutrino energy < 7 GeV, in the range for DUNE.

"The NOvA Near Detector Physics Program", For an
exposure of 63e20 pot, NOvA will use its near detector to measure
many nu cross-sections.  For multiple E & angle bins for 12 final
states, the LOI spells out expected stat & syst uncertainties.

"COHERENT Sensitivity to Dark Matter (DM)",
Detectors made to study CEvNS are capable of constraining DM mass
near 15 MeV/c^2.  They outline strategies to search for a DM flux
consistent with the cosmological DM concentration.
