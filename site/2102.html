<H1>Long-Baseline news, February 2021 </H1>
<P>

*** Two good candidates for DUNE spokesman
</H1> <P>
There was just an election for DUNE cospokesperson between Regina
Rameika and Mary Bishai.  Rameika was elected and will serve with
continuing cospokesperson Stefan Soldner-Rembold.  This was the
first time I voted in a preferential election with two candidates.
Thanks to Ed Blucher for his work on DUNE.

<H1>
*** Four good candidates for NOvA cospokesperson
</H1> <P>
The collaboration is choosing among Jeff Hartnell, Alex Himmel,
Mayly Sanchez and Louise Suter.  The winner will serve together
with Tricia Vahle.  Thanks to Peter Shanahan for his work on NOvA.

<H1>
*** No good candidates for nucleon decay
</H1> <P>
The discovery of neutrino oscillations came from experiments set
up to look for GUTS-inspired nucleon decay.  Super-K continues to
set new limits in a variety of potential modes, and there aren't
many candidates to provide reasonable hope that they will stick
above the background anytime soon.  Early in the search, Maurice
Goldhaber pointed out that he would judge each candidate by its
background.  Do some voters prefer candidates with no background?

<H1>
*** Another candidate
</H1> <P>
I'll be on the ballot in an election on April 6th, but despite the
connection to this month's theme, there is no neutrino relevance.

<H1>
*** SURF users organization established
</H1> <P>
The SURF users organization promotes open discussion on relevant
topics for researchers performing science at SURF, and provides
a communication channel with other users and with SURF management.

*** 28th International Workshop on Weak Interactions and Neutrinos
</H1> <P>
WIN 2021 offers a significant opportunity to assess the status of
the field and to initiate collaborative efforts to address current
physics questions.  Following up workshops in Heidelberg, Irvine &
Bari, WIN 2021 will be online Mon-Sat 7-12 June, with sessions
between 1300 and 1700 GMT.  Required no cost registration and
additional information are now available:  
<A href="http://win2021.umn.edu">
http://win2021.umn.edu.
</A>
Topics are 1) Neutrino Physics, 2) Electro-Weak Symmetry Breaking
and Higgs, 3) Flavor Physics & 4) Astroparticle Physics.  There
will be Plenary highlight talks, recorded talks posted in advance
(asynchronous talks), a live discussion panel and a Virtual poster
session.  Abstract submission and registration are open.

*** research reconfiguration reformulation review renew refresh
</H1> <P>
Sidney Harris has been a favorite science cartoonist of many.

One of my
favorites was "Research, research...If we'd done it right the 1st
time we wouldn't have to do it again."  LBNE had a reconfiguration
& a reformulation.  The many DUNE reviews include renew & refresh.

*** A neutrino experiment at the LHC - FASER
</H1> <P>
The ForwArd Search ExpeRiment at the LHC FASER is searching for
light long-lived particles that are made at the ATLAS interaction
point, move along the beam axis, and decay within FASER.  It will
also study TeV nus.  See

*** power record for NOvA experiment
</H1> <P>
The NuMI beam used by NOvA set a new hourly record beam power of
775 kW.  SY120 and g-2 were off with 1.2 sec rep rate.  A recent
week saw 21.5e18 pot delivered to NuMI

<H1>
*** Neutrino from AT2019FSG
</H1> <P>
IceCube saw the neutrino, SWIFT saw the tidal disruption event, as
did other observatories.

Fixed-Target Searches for New Physics with (10 GeV)
Proton Beams at FNAL, The beam dump target station being proposed
can handle up to 1 MW of power. SBND in the Booster beamline
could search for sub-GeV dark matter, as MiniBooNE had done.

CHESS; Each unit consisting of an upper and lower
cosmic tag, target, propagation medium, and a PMT array, the CHESS
(CHErenkov/Scintillation Separation) setup is an LBNL experiment.
Dichroicons are used to separate Cherenkov & scintillation light,
The setup provides a sensor geometry for sorting out the photons.

Tau-neutrino Production at a multi-TeV Lepton
Collider;  This LOI suggests that tau neutrino interactions should
be further studied, as hints at abnormalities in the tau sector
have accumulated. Muon colliders are ideal for investigating tau
neutrino production in W+W- boson interactions.
