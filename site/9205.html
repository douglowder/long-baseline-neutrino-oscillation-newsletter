This is the first of a planned series of approximately
monthly newsletters on the progress of P822 and the Fermilab
Long Baseline Neutrino Oscillation effort.  If you have
gotten this, you are on an initial distribution list and
will get three unsolicited issues.  In order to remain on the
distribution list, apply to

If you are receiving multiple copies at different addresses,
please tell me your preferred address.
Input and corrections for the newsletter are also welcome.

The Long Baseline Workshop Proceedings are back from the
publisher.  The cover is not as shiny or on as thick paper as
it should be, but the proceedings will be mailed to conference
participants soon.  The document contains 32 papers, 7 of which
are copies of transparencies from the workshop.

In May of 1992, the meeting of the Fermilab long baseline
working group took place at the Soudan mine.  Visiting the mine
for the first time were Dixon Bogert, Bob Bernstein, Sam Childress
and Gordon Koizumi.  Also present were Bill Reay, Steve Werkema,
Ken Heller and many Soudan regulars.  At the meeting, several aspects
of the Long/Short Baseline effort were discussed, including
groundwater radiation regulations, status of the Main Injector,
extraction options towards Soudan.

Possible Interest in collaborating on P822 has been expressed
by Professor V.A. Tsarev from the Lebedev Institute.  His group
had been working on a long baseline beam from UNK to Lake Baikal,
but chances for such a program have diminished.  We will investigate
programs for east-west exchanges which have been developed
by the National Academy of Sciences.

Some limited detector R&amp;D funds have been made available
by the Fermilab Research Division.  Our first priority is a
test bore for the "hole in the wall" scheme of John Alner's.

Several designs for cavity fillers were discussed at the
May 19-22 Soudan collaboration meeting.   No favorite scheme was
chosen at this time, but a set of specifications for such
a detector will be devised over the summer.  Dave Cockerill at RAL
is expecting a Resistive Plate Chamber for testing from
Santonico shortly.

At Argonne's High Energy Physics DOE review, John O'Fallon
reacted positively to the Long Baseline proposal.   This was a
switch from last year, when his office termed long baseline
"an unlikely long shot".

Steve Werkema has been working with others in the Main Injector
group on an extraction scheme for P822.  At a 5-May meeting,
they agreed to concentrate on the scheme which extracts at MI-60
and exits the Main Injector at MI-62.  Options for beam extraction
towards the east (BNL and IMB) and north (Sudbury) are also
receiving attention.  Main Injector persons involved include
Phil Martin, Al Russell and John Johnstone.
