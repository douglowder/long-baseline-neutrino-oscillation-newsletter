<p> </p><h1>
*** NuSAG chairs
</h1>
The Neutrino Scientific Advisory Group will help the DOE and NSF
decide which neutrino projects go forward, particularly reactor,
accelerator long-baseline and double beta decay.  The NuSAG
chairs are Gene Beier from the University of Pennsylvania
(


) and Peter Meyers from Princeton
(


).  The makeup of the rest of the committee
should be announced soon, followed by meetings, reports, etc.

<p> </p><h1>
*** NOvA Stage One approval
</h1>
The Fermilab PAC recommended stage I approval for the NOvA
long-baseline neutrino experiment, and Fermilab director Mike
Witherell accepted this recommendation.  Even though the approval
is unconditional, the PAC gave NOvA a list of questions to answer
in writing for its June Aspen meeting, as part of its continuing
oversight of the experiment. NoVA is aiming for a start in FY07.

<p> </p><h1>
*** NOvA Department
</h1>
In preparation for possible reviews, Fermilab is setting up a
NOvA department.  A new term at Fermilab is "BTeV refugee".

<p> </p><h1>
*** Super-NOvA
</h1>
Is the name taken?  Anyway, this is a specific idea for a second
detector with a shorter baseline.  By exploiting matter effects,
the hierarchy could be determined with only the neutrino run, free
of degeneracies, provided that L/E is the same.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Super-T2K, or a Korean detector for JPARC
</h1>
Not the name used. Anyway, with a new detector in Korea, a 4 MW
JPARC and 8 years of running, Hierarchy and CP can be measured.

<p> </p><h1>
*** NuMI running
</h1>
The target is back in and MINOS is running again.  A spare target
is still available.

<p> </p><h1>
*** MIPP running
</h1>
The Main Injector Particle Production Experiment's goal, among
others, is to measure particle production rates useful for
predicting NuMI event rates.  So far they have 4.79 Million events
on H, Be, C, Al and Bi with 5, 17, 30, 50 and 72 GeV.  The plan
is to use the spare NuMI graphite target in the first week of
June and run with 120 GeV for a month or so, if its available.

<p> </p><h1>
*** MIPP upgrade
</h1>
MIPP readout is currently limited to 60 Hz by the TPC.  A chip
upgrade could increase this by 2 orders of magnitude.  This could
be useful, among other things, for linear collider detector R&amp;D.

*** Atmospheric Neutrino meeting in Mumbai/Bombay before ICRC
</h1>
An atmospheric neutrino pre-meeting (to ICRC) will be held at
IIT-Mumbai on August 1 and 2.  Afterwards there will be a bus to
ICRC in Pune.  Details soon

*** Indian Neutrino Observatory - INO report
</h1>
INO had a meeting 1 May  attended by various Lab directors from
Indian  institutes and collaborators where they formally handed
over the proposal to  build a magnetised iron calorimeter.
The proposal is to build a 50 kton magnetised iron calorimeter to
study the atmospheric neutrino oscillation, precision measurement
of oscillation parameters, matter effect, mass hierarchy problem,
CPT violation.  During a 2nd phase, it could/would be a neutrino
factory far detector.

*** Do Super-Kamiokande staff emit solar neutrinos?
</h1>
In
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0504005"> hep-ex/0504005, </a>
L. Bergman's "Correlating Nu Flux and Staff
Presence in the Super-Kamiokande-I Experiment", an attempt
was made to interpret why significant correlations were found
only for midnight hours and hours around noon, but not for any
other hours: when the sun-earth axis and the staff-detector axis
coincided, the likelihood increased that staff neutrinos (if any)
were counted - as solar neutrinos.  As the author points out,
"...one may reasonably argue the conjecture ... is far-fetched."

Diaries, a Year of Physics Activity:

*** Taup 2005 in Zaragosa Spain 10-14 September 2005
</h1>
The ninth International Conference on Topics in Astroparticle and
Underground Physics, TAUP 2005, will be jointly organized by the
Gran Sasso National Labs (LNGS, Italy) and the University of
Zaragoza,  10-14 Sep 2005.
