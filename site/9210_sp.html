A workshop on using CERN neutrino beams for studying neutrino
oscillations over long baselines is being planned. The  dates
have now been set  for November 20 and 21 at CERN. I
apologize for this late notice which has resulted from the
very tight schedule of the director of CERN. I hope that this
will not make it too difficult for you if you are interested
in attending. More details will be sent at a later date but
I wanted to alert people now about these dates so travel
arrangements can be made.
</p><p>
The purpose of this workshop is to discuss neutrino
oscillations in the specific context of what can be
accomplished with CERN beams and how that compares with other
possible plans. I expect that the schedule will include
discussions on the expected beams, possible experiments for
the Gran Sasso underground laboratory, possible lake or sea
experiments,  Super Kamiokande with a CERN beam, short
baseline experiments already planned at CERN, plans and
progress for Fermilab Main Injector proposals, summaries of
the present state of experimental and theoretical understanding
of the neutrino oscillation picture, and more.

If you have questions, feel free to send me a note. If you
are interested in giving a talk at the workshop, please let me
know. I can be contacted at CITHEX::MICHAEL or MICHAEL@CITHEX.
My phone numbers are 818-356-6669 at Caltech and 39-862-437-212
or 39-862-437-224 at the Gran Sasso. E-mail is probably the
easiest way to contact me.
