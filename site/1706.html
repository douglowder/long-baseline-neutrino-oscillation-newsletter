*** Single Phase ProtoDUNE Technical Design Report
</H1> <P>
ProtoDUNE-SP is the single-phase DUNE Far Detector prototype that
is under construction and will be operated at the CERN Neutrino
Platform in 2018.  It is a crucial part of the DUNE effort towards
construction of the first DUNE 10-kt fiducial mass module (17kt
total) and is a significant experiment in its own right.  With a
total mass of .77kt, it represents the largest monolithic single-
phase LArTPC detector to be built to date.  The TDR describes in
detail in its 165 pages the detector components, installation,
software/computing and test beam specs.  See

*** Neutrino University
</H1> <P>
A series of lectures at Fermilab throughout the summer is
aimed for students at all levels interested in finding out more
about neutrino physics.

*** LBNF ceremonial groundbreaking
</H1> <P>
If you can't be in Lead South Dakota for Neutrino Day 8 July,
maybe you can make it for the Groundbreaking for the Long-Baseline
Neutrino Facility that will support DUNE on 21 July.

And if you have to watch from Fermilab, that's OK too.

*** MINOS decommissioned
</H1> <P>
When MINOS was constructed in the Soudan Lab in the early
days of the 21st century, there was an agreement with the
Minnesota Department of Natural Resources to remove the detector
when the experiment was complete. That "deconstruction" was
started last fall and completed in the spring of 2017.

*** Which ICHEP are you?  For-profit conferences
</H1> <P>
The 39th International Conference on High Energy Physics, ICHEP18,
previously known as the Rochester Conference, will be held in
Seoul Korea.  
<A href="http://www.ichep2018.org/">  
http://www.ichep2018.org/  
</A>
But recently I've seen an
increase in conference announcements, seemingly organized by non-
physicists, including two high energy physics conferences in 2017
called ICHEP, (1 in Tokyo, 1 in Rome).  And that doesn't count
the International Conference on Higher Education Pedagogy.  While
there is certainly potential for confusion, I've not seen anyone
actively complain.  Are these more legitimate than they look, or
have some other purpose?  If you have insights, please share.

*** NuSTEC white paper studies neutrino interaction needs
</H1> <P>
Precision nu experiments rely on their interactions with bound 
nucleons in nuclei, so there is required  a commensurate effort 
in the understanding and modeling of the hadronic and nuclear 
physics of these interactions, which is incorporated as a nuclear 
model in nu event generators.  In a white paper prepared by the 
NuSTEC collaboration, they discuss in detail the impact of these
interactions, especially the nuclear effects, on the measurement 
of neutrino properties using oscillation parameters as a central 
example. See 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03621"> arXiv:1706.03621 </A>.

school is 7-15 Nov at FNAL

*** NOvA searches for active-sterile neutrino mixing
</H1> <P>
The number of neutral current (NC) events doesn't change in the
presence of active-active neutrino mixing, but decreases if
active-sterile mixing takes place.  NOvA sees 95 NC events, with
83.5 +-9.7(stat) +-9.4(syst) expected in the three-nu paradigm.
In a 3+1 model, this limits theta24 < 20.8 degrees and theta34
< 31.2 degrees at 90%CL for delta msquared_41 between .05 eV^2
and 0.5 eV^2.  See 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04592"> arXiv:1706.04592 </A>.

This workshop is part of the  CERN Theory Neutrino Platform
activities and will be carried out in coordination with the
Fermilab Theory group.
