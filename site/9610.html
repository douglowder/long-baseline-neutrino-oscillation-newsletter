*** CERN ends this year's neutrino run
</h1>
The CERN neutrino run for CHORUS+NOMAD ended in early October.
The SPS is now switching over to heavy ions. 1.4 10**19 protons
on target were collected in 1996, ie about 300000 more CC events
in the CHORUS emulsions. In its final year, 1997, CHORUS should
get to &gt; 4.0 10**19 pot.  (NOMAD is proposing to run also in '98.)
Meanwhile, SPY is converging towards its first results (K/pi
ratios first, then pt distributions, absolute rates a bit later).

*** Neutrino '98 and '00 switch venues
</h1>
The Canadian and Japanese hosts of the next two Neutrino conferences
have agreed to exchange dates so that Neutrino 1998 will be in
Takayama, Japan and Neutrino 2000 will be in Sudbury, Canada. This
exchange of dates was proposed by the Canadian group and is also
considered to be preferable by the Japanese group. The tentative dates
for Neutrino 1998 will be early June at Takayama, which is about 40
km from the Superkamiokande site. Takayama is a small historical town
among the mountains.  For further information, contact
Art McDonald and Yoichiro Suzuki.

*** MINOS preparing document on tau identification for PAC
</h1>
There is a large divergence in meaning regarding the terms
"appearance" and "disappearance" neutrino oscillation experiments
among both theorists and experimentalists.   The phrase "tau
identification" is a clear one, and the Fermilab PAC has asked the
MINOS group for a document on that subject by its January meeting.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Nagoya impact parameter tau identification
</h1>
Masahiro Komatsu from the Nagoya emulsion group has been working
on the iron emulsion sandwich idea for a 1 kiloton long-baseline
neutrino experiment, and recently shared his ideas at several US
institutions.  100 microns of emulsion would be layered on each
side of a 1 mm plastic base, and sandwiched with 1 mm iron
sheets.   There would be 50 sheets per module, and 4 x 4 x 140
modules.   Further information is available at
http://flab.phys.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~komatsu/NUMI/numi-e.html which
has been added to the neutrino oscillation industry page.

<p> </p><h1>
*** SNO schedule slips
</h1>
The D2O fill date for SNO is now June 1997, and will take 3-4
months.   Several factors have caused this to be later than hoped
for 2-3 years ago: it is taking longer to build the acrylic
vessel than original estimates; and contractors are not meeting
SNO specifications or their own schedules (for example a faulty
work platform had to be replaced). Building the PMT support
structure and populating it with tubes and cables has gone faster
than expected.  AECL has dropped support of SNO (and all basic
Nuclear Physics research) and this has added some to delays, and
of course delays add to the cost of the project.  As construction
moves along, most SNO groups are adding manpower on site.

*** CERN Courier prompts shirt production
</h1>
Martha Krebs' picture with a MINOS t-shirt appeared with an
article on Fermilab's neutrino program in the September CERN
Courier.  As the continuation of the current administration
seems likely, this has prompted renewed efforts in the COSMOS
experiment to design their t-shirt.
