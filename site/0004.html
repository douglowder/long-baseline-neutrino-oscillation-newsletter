*** ICARUS progress
</h1>Icarus 600T cryostat has been delivered.  Internal assembly
of the first half-module is expected to be completed within
3 months when there will be a full test, with liquid Argon inside,
up to read-out. Transportation to GranSasso will be sometime next
year.  Start-up operation with 14T prototype "baby Icarus" (10m^3)
is going on near Gran Sasso.  Liquid Argon filling took place in
February 2000 and there were after we got beautiful tracks up to
4 meters long immediately.  See

*** NuFact 00 in Monterey
</h1>A workshop on a muon storage ring for a neutrino factory is
May 22-26 at the Naval Postgraduate School located in Monterey
California.  See

*** Lownu workshop before Neutrino 2000
</h1>According to BP98, more than 97% of the solar neutrino flux is
predicted to lie below 1 MeV.  On the day preceeding the opening
session of Neutrino 2000, thursday June 15, there will be a
one-day workshop on experimental problems and techniques related
to detecting solar neutrinos below 1 MeV.  The workshop will
take place on the campus of Laurentian University, Sudbury.

*** NANPino - Dubna neutrino meeting July 19-22
</h1>A topical international workshop on neutrinos and physics beyond
the standard model, NANPino (Non-Accelerator New Physics in
neutrino observations), will be held in Dubna, Moscow region,
RUSSIA, on July 19-22, 2000.   See

*** Neutrinos are boring?
</h1>In April I attended a library convention with my wife, and at
lunch was asked my field.  I answered neutrino physics, and was
told by a librarian from Pennsylvania "That's a conversation
stopper."   But it turned out the librarian next to her was from
the county in South Carolina where neutrinos were discovered.

*** Boring for Neutrinos
</h1>At various points in time, it has been planned that the tunnel for
the neutrino target, decay pipe and near hall at Fermilab be made
with a Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) or by drill/blast.  The Healy
contract was approved with drill/blast, but there is a TBM
available for NuMI.  A value engineering proposal to use the
TBM has been conditionally accepted by Fermilab.  It is now in
Dallas where it was being used for the Dallas subway.

*** Neutrino Bourse at Neutrino 2000
</h1>Northern Canada can be cold, but Neutrino 2000 will be hot!
New results on solar neutrinos from Super-K and first results
from SNO.  There will be more results from K2K and hopefully a
clear nu-tau signal from DONUT.  The program can be found at

*** Interfering with oscillations
</h1>Baillon (below) suggests that the deficit of atmospheric
neutrinos may be due to coherent numu e to nue mu forward
scattering, as an alternative to oscillations.   One issue is
whether orthogonal states interfere.  Also, the
scatterer size is much larger than the neutrino wavelength,
so neutrinos behave like particles, not waves, and the
interference terms wash out.  The author's view is at
