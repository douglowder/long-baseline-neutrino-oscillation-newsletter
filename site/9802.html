*** NOE changes available
</h1>Recent changes in the configuration of the NOE detector,
(proposed for the CERN to Gran Sasso long-baseline experiment)
the addition of a TRD detector and improved performances are
described in a status report, available at
http://www1.na.infn.it/wsubnucl/accel/noe/noe.html

<p> </p><h1>
*** Los Alamos Science focuses on neutrinos
</h1>A beautiful edition of the publication "Los Alamos Science"
focuses on "Celebrating the neutrino".  16 articles tell some of
the stories about neutrinos today.  Send requests for Number
25 to Los Alamos Science, MSF656, Los Alamos, NM. 87545.

*** NuMI in President's budget
</h1>For fiscal year 1998-99, the president/DOE is asking for $14.3M
for the NuMI project at Fermilab.   There will also probably be
$1.5M in the Fermilab capital equipment budget.  This total is
less than the $20M in last year's suggested funding profile.
MINOS and NuMI have a "Lehman" budget review scheduled in April.

*** Draft Gilman Panel report endorses MINOS
</h1>It wrote: 'The Subpanel endorses the importance of the long-
baseline neutrino oscillation program at Fermilab. The question of
neutrino mass and flavor mixing is of fundamental interest for
particle physics. The 1995 HEPAP Subpanel on Accelerator-Based
Neutrino Oscillation Experiments recommended that "the Fermilab
program should remain flexible to react to new information."
Consistent with this, we recommend that Fermilab carefully
evaluate the configuration of the NUMI/MINOS facility in the
light of results becoming available from experiments elsewhere. We
further recommend that the role of the short-baseline COSMOS
experiment be reviewed.'

<p> </p><h1>
*** NRC Report on Particle Physics endorses neutrino mass
</h1>'Neutrino oscillations: Many experiments now give hints that a
neutrino of one family can change into one of another family. One
of the most important discoveries possible in the next decade
would be the confirmation of any one of these hints.'

<p> </p><h1>
*** HANUL prototype under construction
</h1>The High-energy Astrophysics NeUtrino Laboratory is a design for
surface neutrino detectors, using a sandwich of magnets between
water Cherenkov detectors.  If a prototype works as expected,
25 modules covering 1000 m^2 will be built, according
to the February 6 issue of Science.  But all is not blue sky.
The article concludes, "...it could also inspire millions of
young people to consider becoming scientists."

<p> </p><h1>
*** Lab directors discuss Long-baseline, workshops
</h1>Fermilab's Director and CERN's director-designate are on the
phone from time to time discussing common interests like long-
baseline neutrino oscillation experiments.  One idea is a pair of
workshops to be held in Italy and the US.  The first one might
be in the fall.  P. Strolin and R. Bernstein are investigating.

<p> </p><h1>
*** ORLaND encouraged to write proposal
</h1>There is $157M in the FY99 President's budget to start the
SNS, the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) to be built at ORNL.
The ORLaND proponents visited the DOE in February and presented a
case for a neutrino facility add-on.  They were encouraged to
submit a proposal by this coming summer.  This proposal is to be
reviewed by HEPAP and most likely by NSAC as well.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Emulsion Workshop After Neutrino '98
</h1>There will be an International Workshop on Nuclear Emulsion
12-14 June 1998 in Nagoya Japan.  The workshop is organized
by neutrino enthusiasts.  email:
The preliminary list of topics is: Emulsion quality and handling,
(Gel quality,  Experimental application and techniques) Analysis
machines, (Nagoya, Italy, and CERN), Experimental results and
plans(Chorus, Donut, Long-baseline experiments)

A structure for the mass matrices breaking SO(10) predicts a large
mixing angle between \nu_{\mu} and \nu_{\tau}, as suggested
by atmospheric neutrino data. The mixing angles of the electron
neutrino are predicted to be small.

downgoing atmospheric neutrinos, the uncertainty in the path
length due to the unknown production height in the atmosphere is
larger than most detector resolution effects.
