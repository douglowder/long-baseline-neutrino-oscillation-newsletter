A one day scientific symposium in honor of long-term spokesman of
the MINOS experiment at FNAL will be held at the Stanford Alumni
Center on Friday 10 Nov, and will cover topics from Stan’s career
as well as others from contemporary physics. The memorial service
on Thursday 9 Nov will be held at the Stanford Memorial Church
with a reception afterwards at the Stanford Faculty Club. Register
by 31 Oct at

*** Status of JSNS2/JSNS2-II sterile nu search at J-PARC

 JSNS2 searches
for neutrino oscillation to sterile nus with a short baseline.
JSNS2 had its 3rd run April-June using a single near detector.
4,279×10^21 POT were accumulated for a total of 3.276×10^22 POT
since 2020, 29% of the approved POT. New electronics have been
tested during this run. For JSNS2-II, a new far detector is under
construction. 142 10-inch PMTs out of 228 in total were installed
by end of May. The FD acrylic tank was moved into the FD area and
is awaiting installation. JSNS2-II will start taking data in FY23.

*** Contract for underground gas liquefication for DUNE
</H1> <P>
Air Products, an industrial gases company from Pennsylvania has
the contract for an underground liquid nitrogen refrigeration
system.  It will ultimately supply the 17,500 tons of liquid argon
for DUNE as part of the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility.

<H1>
*** Argon cost for ProtoDUNE in Europe has been rising
</H1> <P>
The increase in the cost of liquid Argon in Europe will not enable
CERN to fill both DUNE prototypes.  The proposal is to fill one
in early 24, then transfer Ar a few months later to the other. The
DUNE EB and FD & Cryogenics management agreed that NP02 (vertical
drift) will go first, and then NP04 (horizontal drift).  Also see

*** Meld: Feasibility of a Framework-less Framework for analysis
</H1> <P>
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16710"> arXiv:2308.16710 </A>
discusses that existing frameworks support rigid,
collider-based data models which do not map well to nu experiments
like DUNE.  Meld aims to address this.

*** Watch a Solar Eclipse or go to a 2024 APS meeting?  Both!
</H1> <P>
The American Physical Society shifted the dates for its April
meeting to 3-6 April 2024 in Sacramento because the total solar
eclipse will occur on Monday, 8 April and all April Meeting
attendees can be available to witness it.

*** Would you vote for a physicist or an engineer for President?
</H1> <P>
That will be the choice in Mexico next year, where the choice
will be for physicist Claudia Sheinbaum, a former mayor of Mexico
City, or Xóchitl Gálvez, 60, described by the NY Timas as "an
outspoken engineer with Indigenous roots who rose from poverty to
become a tech entrepreneur."
