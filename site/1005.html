*** Opera no phantom, sees first long-baseline cc tau neutrino
</H1> <P>
It is not easy to distinguish the interaction of tau neutrinos
and to measure enough neutrinos in a long-baseline experiment
we need a lot of mass.  The LNGS Opera experiment has done both,
reporting their first charged current tau neutrino candidate from 
1/3 of their data:

*** The DED-C is dead, long live DURA
</H1> <P>
The Deep Underground Science and Engineering Lab (DUSEL) has the
DUSEL Experiment Development Committee (DED-C) to advise it.  Now
it will transform itself into a User's organization, the DUSEL
Research Association (DURA).  The proposed charter for this new 
organization is available at:

*** LBNE physicists meet in Deadwood South Dakota
</H1> <P>
130 members of the Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE)
met in Deadwood SD to plan building large water and/or argon
detectors for a new Fermilab neutrino beam as part of the LBNE
project.  (None of them were shot in the back, as Wild Bill 
Hickok had been in 1876.)  The project includes two 100-kton
Water Cerenkov Equivalent Detectors (20 kton of liquid Argon
might be 100kton WCE).  Physics groups are working on the 
capabilities for long-baseline nus, short-baseline nus, proton
decay solar nus, geo/reactor nus, UHE nus.  The project is 
writing a Conceptual Design Report for a November CD1 review.

*** Daedalus concept for CP violation at DUSEL
</H1> <P>
Daedalus would use a large Gd H20 detector & build several 
stopped pi beams.  As described in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.4079"> ArXiv:0912.4079 </A>
one could
use new high powered (2MW) low energy (2 GeV) low
cost cyclotrons to search for inverse beta decay, due to
numubar to nuebar oscillation.  In phase 1, there would be
3 cyclotrons at 20 km, two at 8 km, and one at 1.5 km,
using 9.4e22 POT per year.  The design could match the 
sensitivity of an LBNE run with 30e20 nu plus 30e20 antinu.

*** ICARUS full and has tracks
</H1> <P>
Mythical Icarus plunged to his death.  The ICARUS experiment 
has been more deliberate, & now both 300 ton modules at LNGS are 
full of liquid Argon.  They turned on 12:14 27 May & immediately 
tracks were seen.  T600 is triggered by the internal phototubes.  
Purity isn't yet optimal, but visible track lengths exceed several
10s of cm drift.  The high voltage on the cathode was 40 kV and it 
is now brought to the 70 kV nominal, corresponding to the field of 
500V/cm Both a single vertical track and a large horizontal shower 
have been observed. The data collection continues at the rate of 
several events/hour in half of the T600 mass.

*** Leon Lederman's Dead Sea Joke at Neutrino 1994
</H1> <P>
Neutrino physicists are heading to Athens and Neutrino 2010
promises to be an exciting conference.  The President of 
Israel welcomed Neutrino '94 attendees in Eilat on his 70th
birthday, and asked if anyone else was over 70.  First speaker
Lederman raised his hand, and started his talk saying  that he 
was so old, he knew the Dead Sea when it had just been sick.

<H1>
*** LSND effect rises from the dead
</H1> <P>
While the MiniBooNE neutrino data had a low energy excess,
their previously shown antineutrino data has a small
antineutrino excess at higher electron energy which might be
consistent with LSND-like oscillations.  See plot 26 at
<A href="http://www-boone.fnal.gov/slides-talks/conf-talk/louis/aspen2010.ppt">

Additional antinu data from MiniBooNE could be shown in Athens.

*** First man-made neutrino?  Dead Wrong
</H1> <P>
<A href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/engineering/extreme-machines/scientists-create-neutrinos-on-earth?src=rss"> 
http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/engineering/extreme-machines/scientists-create-neutrinos-on-earth?src=rss
</A>
An article in the popular press about the first neutrino
seen in T2K got one detail wrong.  There are mistakes in 
"long-baseline news" too.

<H1>
*** Theta13 study with Super-K atmospheric neutrinos
</H1> <P>
Super-K has combined their atmospheric neutrino data and done a
three neutrino study.  In particular, they see if there is a 
distortion of the neutrino flux consistent with non-zero q13.
For the normal (inverted) hierarchy they limit (sin theta13)^2
 < 0.04 (0.09).  Note the missing 2 which affects the 
number by 4.

*** Present and Future at Kamioka Laboratory in Japan
</H1> <P>
A new brochure for visitors at Kamioka describes the research
program there, & includes past accomplishments and the present T2K
long-baseline neutrino oscillation program.  Three future projects
are mentioned, 1) adding Gd to Super-K, 2) a future 1 Mton water
detector and 3) a 10 ton liquid xenon detector (XMASS).

*** Minos, Icarus and Daedalus
Preparing for Neutrino 2010, here is a Greek mythology review.
Icarus is the Son of Daedalus who dared to fly too near the sun 
on wings of feathers and wax. Daedalus had been imprisoned by 
King Minos of Crete within the walls of his own invention, the 
Labyrinth. But the great craftsman's genius would not suffer 
captivity. He made two pairs of wings by adhering feathers to 
a wooden frame with wax. Giving one pair to his son, he 
cautioned him that flying too near the sun would cause the wax 
to melt. But Icarus became ecstatic with the ability to fly and 
forgot his father's warning. The feathers came loose and Icarus 
plunged to his death in the sea.
