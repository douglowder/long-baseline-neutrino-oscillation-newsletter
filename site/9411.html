</p><h1>*** HEPAP </h1>
HEPAP has approved the idea of a subpanel and members and senior lab people
have been invited to offer suggestions for a chair and members.  BNL and
Fermilab, if victorious would need extra funds. This could mean that civil
construction could maybe start earlier, eg FY97, for example through expansion
of the scope of MI.   The subpanel received a tentative charge, and the time
scale is such that a decision might be expected before the summer 1995.

<p>

</p><h1>*** DPF offers its good offices to HEPAP on Long Baseline
</h1>
The DPF executive committee which had considered instituting an ad-hoc panel
to discuss long baseline neutrino oscillations in the United States decided to
offer to help the HEPAP sub-panel carry that along.  Some members of the
sub-panel felt that they were just a few months too late to effectively
contribute more with an independent effort.

</p><h1>*** Long Baseline Collaboration Meetings; December 3/4
</h1>
The Fermilab LBC will meet December 3-4 at Fermilab.  First we will meet
at 8:30-8:50 am Saturday on the 2nd floor.  Then, working groups will meet
Saturday, and report on Sunday.  Preparations for the January proposal
document will continue during "Long Baseline Week" on January 9-13th at FNAL.
<p>
</p><h1>*** Gran Sasso Long Baseline meeting; December 15th/16th
</h1>
The Gran Sasso Laboratories is organizing a series of meetings to investigate
the scientific and technical details of long baseline neutrino oscillation
experiments, and to stimulate the emergence of proposals.  The first meeting
will be mainly dedicated to  discussions among the present Gran Sasso users,
the groups already involved in neutrino oscillation experiments, and any one
interested in detector development and issues such as optimal beam design,
detector design and physics goals.  The first meeting will take place at Gran
Sasso on December 15th starting at 10 am. and will presumably continue till
Friday (16th) noon.  For any information concerning scientific issues, please
contact:  Aurelio GRILLO ().  For logistics, please
contact:  F. MASCIULLI ()LNGS FAX +39 862 410795
<p>
</p><h1>*** Workshop on Future Directions in Particle and Nuclear Physics Dec2-3
</h1>
This meeting at Fermilab on Friday/Saturday has 5 working groups.  The lepton
physics group is chaired by Hal White, Bill Reay and Ari Bodek.  Draft copies
of the report are available from smtp%"white@".  If you
plan to attend, contact smtp%"" for a registration form.

</p><h1>*** Fermilab PAC hears Long Baseline Collaboration
</h1>
On November 18th and 19th, the FNAL LBC made a presentation to the Fermilab
PAC as had been requested in the June 1994 Aspen PAC letter.   After an
introduction and overview, brief presentations were made on the status of the
beam, analysis, detector R&amp;D and site.  Acting PAC chair John Huth said
publicly said they are quite impressed with the progress made so far, and PAC
chair, Don Hartill, who was at SLAC seconded that privately.   They are
willing to consider a proposal document for the Feb. PAC meeting, but
expressed concern that the the document be a quality one and include some
detail on costs.  The collaboration promised to do just that.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Babynu presented
</h1>
Hal White and Fred Federspiel made a presentation to the FNAL-PAC about
using a beam from the booster to make a low energy <e>=700 MeV, to study
numu to nue at low mixing angle and high delta m-squared.  Rough event
rates were 23 Million events per year in a 200 ton near detector (32 meters)
and 1100 oscillation e events per year if P = .02, as conceivably suggested
by the LSND data.
<p>

</p><p>
</p><h1>*** LSND running
</h1>
LSND's 8 (-0.8) possible anomalous events last spring came from 1800 C of
running.  They have 5000 C more data in a run ending soon, and will get
another 3000 C next summer, after which nuclear physics at Los Alamos
officially comes to an end.  However, LAMPF will still be used by
the military, perhaps to make Tritium, and perhaps LSND could continue
further.   KARMEN continues to run as well, but ISIS is 200 microamps
compare to 1 milliamp beam at LAMPF.
<p>

</p><p>
</p><h1>*** Beam Pipe Length
</h1>
The Fermilab Neutrino Beam Group has chosen 800 m as the default length for
calculating neutrino fluxes, compared to the previous value of 320 m.  With a
default radius of 1.0m, this increases neutrino fluxes for the far detector
by 2.4.  Costs will be determined for beam pipe lengths of 600 m and 1000m.
A study of the electron neutrino contamination versus beam pipe length showed
that nu-e's from K's went down for the longer beam, nu-e's from mu decay rose,
and the total contribution stayed under 1% (0.7%).
<p>

</p><p>
</p><h1>*** Fermilab Main Entrance and aesthetics
</h1>
An 800 m beam pipe puts the experiment between the two legs of Pine Street.
An extended discussion at a beam meeting took place on the aesthetics of a
building there and how and where to move it.  Jean Rhoades asked, "Why are
we worried that someone coming to a Laboratory would see an experiment?"
