*** Latest SNO results improve precision on theta-12
</H1> <P>
In the 3rd and final phase of the Canadian Sudbury Neutrino
Observatory (SNO), 36 strings of 3He proportional counters were 
used to measure neutrons from neutrino neutral current 
interactions in the D20.  When the box was opened just before 
neutrino 2008, a signal of 983+-77 neutral current events was 
observed, over a background of 185+-25.  They fit their data 
together with KamLAND to obtain theta_12=33.8+1.4-1.3 degrees, 
an improved precision of 40%.    see

*** Early stages of T2K beam in Japan
</H1> <P>
T2K will use a 3 GeV injector to a 50 GeV main ring.  In May, the
3 GeV beam was injected into the main ring for the first time.  At 
the end of Feb 08, the beam power per pulse reached 5 kW/pulse. 
Since the 3 GeV ring will operate at 25 Hz (25 pulses per second), 
this power/pulse is equivalent to 130 kW per second if 25 pulses 
were accelerated.

*** NOvA funded in supplemental US budget bill
</H1> <P>
A supplemental funding bill for the Iraq war included funding for 
science which allowed Fermilab to cancel a round of planned 
involuntary layoffs.  There was also $9.5M for the neutrino 
experiment NOvA.  NOvA also got mentioned in the 2009 budget 
markup.  Everyone expects a continuing resolution starting 
October 2008, but the markup might become the basis of a real 
budget in 3/09.

<H1>
*** Non-zero theta13?
</H1> <P>
A global analysis including recent results from Neutrino 2008 
finds two converging hints for theta_13 > 0, an older one coming 
from atmospheric neutrino data and a newer one from the 
combination of solar and long-baseline reactor data.  
sin^2(2 theta_13) = 0.064+-0.040 See Fogli et al

(While many think a 1.6 sigma effect should be ignored, remember 
a 90% CL upper limit is the absence of a 1.29 sigma effect.)

<H1>
*** New vision for US HEP in P5 report
</H1> <P>
The vision for the future of High Energy Physics in the United 
States includes a large detector in the proposed Deep Underground 
Science and Engineering Lab (DUSEL) and a high intensity neutrino 
source at Fermilab.  A proto-collaboration to work on the 
long-baseline neutrino experiment is forming.  They met in June 
at Fermilab, again 14 Aug, and before UDIG (next) at BNL.

<H1>
*** DUSEL UDIG, October 16-17, at Brookhaven
</H1> <P>
A Workshop on Underground Detectors Investigating Grand 
Unification (UDIG) will consider topics in Nucleon Decay, 
Supernovae and Oscillations.  An LB-DUSEL Collaboration Meeting 
will be held 15 Oct as a prelude to the workshop.

<H1>
*** Lewis and Clark
</H1> <P>
The DUSEL long-baseline detector might be water or argon, for 
which the Dakota-appropriate acronyms LEWIS and CLARK could work:
Large Experiment Water cerenkov for Interdisciplinary Science 
(LEWIS) and Cryogenic Liquid ARgon 100 Kiloton scale (CLARK).  
 
<H1>
*** MicroBooNE approved at Fermilab
</H1> <P>
MicroBooNE, a proposal for a liquid Argon Detector in Fermilab's 
booster beam has received stage 1 approval; recommended by the 
FNAL PAC and approved by the director.  It also received an NSF 
MRI for the TPC and PMT array for the detector.  The experiment 
will address the low energy excess observed by the MiniBooNE 
experiment, measure low energy neutrino cross sections, and serve 
as the necessary next step in a phased Ar detector program.

<H1>
*** Let's be careful with the language of science
</H1> <P>
The 2nd edition of the 20 volume Oxford English Dictionary 
defines "neutrino" as "Either of two stable, uncharged leptons, 
(associated respectively with the electron and muon) which have
zero or negligible mass and an extremely low probability of
interacting with matter".  I showed this to a joint English/
Physics major who said "That is wrong in so many ways."

*** "There is no need to go to Jupiter to enhance our knowledge"
</H1> <P>
That sentence can be found in the concluding paragraph of
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.0429"> arXiv:0806.0429 </A>,
 "The Role of Solar Neutrinos in Jupiter"

<H1>
*** Longbnews schedule
</H1> <P>
I try to get the newsletter out on one of the first 4 working
days of each month for the previous month.  Sorry this is late.
