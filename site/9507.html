Long Baseline Neutrino News                   July 1995

</p><h1>*** HEPAP nu oscillation subpanel favors Fermilab </h1>
The HEPAP subpanel on neutrino oscillations met July 24th to
July 28th and deliberated the future for neutrino oscillation
experiments in the US.  Their recommendation is in favor of
the MINOS and COSMOS experiments at Fermilab.  Their report will
be presented at the September 18th meeting of HEPAP for transmittal
to DOE undersecretary Martha Krebs.

</p><h1>*** Gran Sasso Call for longbaseline LOI's, Due 31-Dec-1995.</h1>
On 7/31, INFN director Piero Monacelli has issued a Call for LOI's for
CERN-GRANSASSO Long Baseline Experiments.  They are investigating
whether to use "un sacco di soldi" (i.e. money) to fund experiment(s)
and part of the beam.  The CERN-GRAN SASSO neutrino-beam has still to
be decided, but its design and approval can go in parallel with
planning.  The Letters of Intent should outline the physics goals, the
conceptual design, a preliminary cost, and possible Collaboration.
Detectors could be housed in one of the Gran Sasso halls, dimensions
10x10x50 m3.  LOI's should outline if the experiment needs a near
detector at CERN.  November 9-10 a two day workshop on longbaseline
neutrino oscillations will be organized at Gran Sasso.

</p><h1>*** Fermilab and URA visit to Soudan</h1>
In mid July, Fermilab director John Peoples, URA President
Fred Bernthal, and URA vice president Ezra Heitowit visited the
Soudan mine and future MINOS site.  Marvin Marshak was host.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Discovery Potential</h1>
Neutrino Oscillation limits are usually quoted at 90%CL, but few
would believe a signal with 10% chance probability.  In order to
deal with this issue, Lincoln Wolfenstein and the HEPAP subpanel
defined "discovery potential" as an observation with at least
99.9%CL and a second independent observation with at least 95%CL.
While this does not guarantee that signals are right or will be
believed, it better defines the discovery reach than 90%CL.

<p>
</p><h1>*** LSND and discovery potential</h1>
LSND has a positive result in numubar to nuebar oscillations
from pi+ at rest.  They are now busy analyzing the
decay-in-flight signal which could give an independent
confirmation or refutation.  Based on their recent experience,
they have internally agreed not to present any results until
there is a paper.  Meanwhile, the new run starts August 1st;
the accelerator started up July 31st and got 100 microamps right
away.  They are assured of a two month run, but are pleading
for a four month run which would double their statistics.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Ideas for negative m^2 in beta decay</h1>
Suppose n-&gt;pe in addition to n-&gt;pe nu (Forget about angular
momentum conservation for a moment).  Then there would be a
peak in the endpoint of tritium beta decay along with the
falloff.  One can phenomenologically fit the measured spectra
with B = 10^-9.  The next step is to see if n--&gt;pe could
be induced by cosmological or solar neutrinos.  The process
seems too low by about 10^10.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Karmen has increased sensitivity for nu-osc</h1>
In light of the possible LSND signal, Karmen lowered their neutron
threshold for neutron capture signals from 15mv to 12mv.  This
increases their efficiency for seeing neutrons from 20.4% to 32%.
This change was made February 1995.  With more data than before,
they continue to see no oscillations from 7360C.  Their likelihood
fit gives a negative signal (near -3) at all dmsq except +1 event
6 eV^2.  This limits P&lt;3.5 10^-3 which is stable for all cuts.
They also turn this into a limit on exotic mu decay, mu+ to
e+,nuebar,numu with B&lt;.003.  Optimally they will get 2250 C/year.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Another missing neutrino</h1>
A new calculation of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis predicts that the
number of neutrinos is 2.0 +- 0.3.  The ingredients are the
Helium 4 primordial abundance (.232) and a calculation of the D
constraint.  The idea is criticized by the Chicago Mafia (see
below).  There are two interesting though contrived solutions
to this crisis:  (1) 20 MeV tau neutrino, decay .1 s; or (2)
different rates of nu-e and nu-ebar.  The difference , a lepton
number/photon would be about 1/2%, not 10-9 like baryon/photon.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Fermilab Fixed target Working Group</h1>
A working group at Fermilab is studying future fixed target
physics opportunities.  Jeff Appel("") is chairman.
The charge is to survey the open physics questions that can be
addressed by fixed target experiments using 8, 120 or 800 GeV p's.
Their goal is to have a report finished for the fall (FNAL) PAC
meeting.   They won't spend much time on nu oscillations because
the NuMI program is clear and depends on the results of the HEPAP
subpanel.   They will look to see if there is a compelling
rationale for any other program with booster or Main Injector
protons, as well as 800 GeV and maybe even higher.  Both particle
and nuclear ideas are being considered.
