*** ICFA Neutrino Panel
</h1> <p>
ICFA has set up a neutrino panel with the following mandate:  "To
promote international cooperation in the development of the
accelerator-based neutrino oscillation program and to promote
international collaboration in the development a neutrino factory
as a future intense source of neutrinos for particle physics
experiments."  The panel will have 15 members; five each for Asia,
the Americas and Europe. In addition to the geographical balance,
the panel should have a balance of expertise ranging from theory
and phenomenology, neutrino experiment and accelerators.  Send
nominations for US members to the intensity frontier conveners,
De Gouvea, Pitts, Scholberg &amp;/or Zeller.

*** Further Exploitation of NuMI, new email list for study group
</h1> <p>
A 6 month study interested in further use of the FNAL NuMI beam
will see whether there are sensible ideas.  Examples: GLADE, a
Cherenkov Detector in Lake Superior or a mine pit, and a 5 kt
Cherenkov detector in the MINOS hall.  The focus is delta-CP.
While none of the baselines are long enough for the MH, its likely
that anyway MH will be uncovered by measurements over the next
decade.  A 200 kT Cherenkov detector can get the delta CP to
between 20-50 degrees error across all delta (GLOBES simulations
under way).  Join the email list by sending to

with no subject and 1 line in the body:  subscribe e-numi.

*** Important election starts Monday November 5
</h1> <p>
The LBNE cospokesperson election will run from 5 to 16 November.
The candidates are Chris Mauger from Los Alamos and Robert Wilson
from Colorado State University.  Only collaborators can vote.

</p><h1>
*** LBNE has surface operation review
</h1> <p>
Simulations indicate a combination of passive shielding and the
precise pattern recognition provided by LAr can reject
backgrounds to at most a few events per year.  An independent
review concluded the analysis is sound and risk is manageable.

</p><h1>
*** LBNE has CD1 review,
</h1> <p>
LBNE's cost review at Fermilab was the day after Hurricane Sandy
hit the east coast and, among other problems, made travel from
Washington, where several reviewers were located, and from Long
Island, where several reviewees were located, difficult.  But the
review went well, and LBNE has been recommended for CD-1, subject
to dotting a few i's.  The cost estimate is $867M with a range of
$687-$945M.  CD3A is now planned for 4/2015 and CD2 for 4/2016.

*** A clean mean neutrino beam
</h1> <p>
After Sandy, should NuSTORM change its name?

*** MicroBooNE construction begins
</h1> <p>
Construction has started on the MicroBooNE Liquid Argon neutrino
detector at Fermilab.  In spring of 2013, the collaboration will
have finished building the LArTPC and will move it from its
current location, the DZero assembly building, to its permanent
home at the eventual Liquid Argon Test Facility.

*** Should Conferences proceed with Proceedings?
</h1> <p>
Long after Neutrino 2012 we don't have proceedings from Neutrino
2010.  Long after NuFACT 2012 we don't have it from NuFACT 2011.
For the proceeding for NuFACT 2009 &amp; 2010, the publisher wouldn't
post the online proceedings till the book was done.

*** Stewardship of double beta decay in U.S. DOE
</h1> <p>
One unanswered question about neutrinos is whether they are of a
Dirac or Majorana nature.  The way to test this is with a zero
neutrino double beta decay experiment.  There are several ideas
for experiments, such as Majorana, Gerda, CUORE, EXO, etc.
<a href="http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/double_beta_decay.html"> http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/double_beta_decay.html
</a>
At the Community Planning Meeting, it was pointed out that in the
U.S., this would be funded by nuclear physics section of the DOE,
and not the high energy physics section.  If there are hints for
the inverted hierarchy, more HEP people will get interested.

</p><h1>
*** Statistics of the mass hierarchy determination
</h1> <p>
Since the mass hierarchy has 2 possible values, some statistical
issues differ from measurements of a continuous parameter.  This
and related issues are discussed in X. Qian et al.
