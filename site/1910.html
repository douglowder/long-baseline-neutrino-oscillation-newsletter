*** T2K indication of CP violation in the lepton sector
</h1> <p>
A value for delta_CP other than 0 or pi would enhance numu to nue
oscillations for neutrinos in the normal mass order and suppress
antinu oscillations.  In
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03887"> arXiv:1910.03887 </a>,
T2K favors a large
enhancement of the neutrino oscillation probability.  The 3-sigma
CL (on a -2pi to 0 scale) is -3.41 to -0.03.  Likelihood surface
data will be available at

*** Neutrinos in European science book
</h1> <p>
The European briefing book,
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11775"> arXiv:1910.11775 </a>
was prepared by the
European Strategy for Particle Physics Preparatory Group as part
of the process to formulate the European Strategy Update for the
consideration &amp; approval of the CERN Council.  Chap. 6 covers nus.
It discusses the current long-baseline experiments NOvA and T2K in
the context of the future DUNE &amp; Hyper-Kamiokande projects.  JUNO,
IceCube &amp; ORCA are mentioned, as well as the ENUBET and nuSTORM
proposals.  Cosmology, Neutrinoless double beta decay, direct mass
experiments and searches for new states are also covered.  It
concludes, "A balanced support to this world-wide effort from
Europe will allow to secure the determination of the oscillation
parameters, aim at the discovery of CP violation and test for
possible deviations from the 3-nu framework."

The preliminary topics for Neutrinos in the runup to Snowmass 2021
in the group "Frontiers in Neutrino Physics" are 1) Neutrino mass,
2) Neutrino cross sections, 3) Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay,
4) CEvNS, 5) 3-Flavor Oscillations, 6) Nu Physics from
Astrophysical Sources (Solar, Atmospheric, Supernova, Extra-
galactic), 7) Sterile neutrinos and other BSM candidates, 8) Geo-
neutrinos, tomography and other practical applications

*** What if KATRIN had measured 1.1 eV?
</h1> <p>
Recently
(<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06069"> arXiv:1909.06069 </a>)

the KATRIN experiment reported a limit
on the effective nu mass in tritium beta decay of 1.1 eV.  What if
they had measured that value?   In the 3-nu paradigm, &amp; with the 2
known values of delta msquared, it would mean that all 3 masses do
not differ from 1.1 eV by more than 0.1%.  The uncertainty from
experiment is much larger. The tritium spectrum is an incoherent
sum of 3 spectra with eigenmasses &amp; are fit simultaneously.  The
eigenmasses are close, so the fit is the same for 1 mass as all 3.

*** Jorge Morfin appointed scientist emeritus

Jorge Morfin has always been an eminent neutrino physicist.  Now
it has been officially recognized.  See

*** Is the normal mass order just what we need?
</h1> <p>
It seems to make the 0nu-2beta experiments, and hence determining
the Majorana nature of neutrinos harder.  But S. Ge &amp; J. Zhu
(<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02666"> arXiv:1910.02666 </a>)
argue it opens the opportunity to determine the
solar octant and measure two Majorana CP phases.

</p><h1>
*** Neutrino conversations
</h1> <p>
There are not many spouses at neutrino conferences.  Lucky for me,
mine has been an exception.  Once I accompanied her to a meeting
of the American Library Association in North Carolina and attended
lunch as a spouse.  "What do you do?" I was asked by a seat mate.
"I'm a neutrino physicist." I answered.  "That's a conversation
stopper" was the reply.  But it turned out that the next librarian
at the table was from the city in South Carolina where neutrinos
were discovered, she knew it, and a long conversation followed.

*** Neutrino costumes
</h1> <p>
Over the years, I've attempted to include in this newsletter some
attempts at wry humor, and of course not everyone gets the point.
But this reference to neutrino costumes; well I didn't get it all.
