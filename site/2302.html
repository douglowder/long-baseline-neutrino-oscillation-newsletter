*** P5 Town Hall at FNAL/ANL includes neutrino focus
</H1> <P>
Registration is now open for the Fermilab/Argonne P5 Town Hall
21-24 March.  
<A href="https://indico.fnal.gov/event/58272/  ">
https://indico.fnal.gov/event/58272/  
</A>
Recommended is
early registration, especially for Foreign Nationals/permanent
residents.  In-person registration closes at 9am CST 16 March.

<H1>
*** 2023 International Neutrino Summer School 7-18 Aug at FNAL
</H1> <P>
This will be at Fermilab, 7-18 Aug 2023 (INSS2023).  Applications
will close 31 March 31. The school brings together grad students
and postdocs, along with great teachers and researchers in an
intensive 2-week-long learning experience in an open and
interactive environment.

*** FY23 United States DOE Office of Science Budget Outcome
</H1> <P>
LBNF/DUNE will receive $176M and PIP-II $120M next year, matching
the requested amounts. They also had received $125M & $10M through
the IRA. Schedule estimates for LBNF/DUNE have stabilized with
installation slated to begin in 2024 and the start of full science
operations targeted for 2031.  LBNF/DUNE’s total cost to DOE is
now expected to exceed $3B, and PIP-II almost $1B. Those estimates
do not include the > $1B in international commitments.

<H1>
*** Bethe prize to Princeton Physicist Frank Calaprice
</H1> <P>
Calaprice, an emeritus professor of physics at Princeton, will get
the 2023 award “for pioneering work on large-scale ultra-low-
background detectors (Borexino) measuring the complete
spectroscopy of solar neutrinos, culminating in observation of CNO
neutrinos, thus experimentally proving operation of all the
nuclear energy driving reactions of stellar evolution.”

<H1>
*** NuMI beam returns to NOvA
</H1> <P>
A December horn stripline failure prevented the Fermilab neutrino
program from taking beam in 2023 until now.  But they have taken
advantage of machine studies and may be able to make up the 2023
beam goals.  Reducing the repetition rate to 1.2 s represents a
16.7% increment in beam power.  As there is more high power (>900
kW) operation, they will enlarge the beam spot from 1.2 to 1.5 mm.

*** Here Comes the Sun: Solar Parameters & Long-Baseline neutrinos
</H1> <P>
In 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08513"> arXiv:2302.08513, </A>
P. Denton and J. Gehrlein discuss how long-
baseline experiments (NOvA, T2K, DUNE, Hyper-K) can determine the
solar neutrino parameters, and thus all 6 oscillation parameters.
While sensitivities are not competitive with existing constraints,
they are orthogonal and provide a consistency check of a less
probed sector of the three-flavor oscillation picture.

<H1>
*** Final result for Majorana Demonstrator
</H1> <P>
It set a lifetime limit for 76Ge of 8.3e25y (90% CL).  Background
reduction techniques will be combined with those from GERDA to
achieve even lower levels in LEGEND.  PhysRevLett.130.062501

*** Neutrino Structure Functions from GeV to EeV energies
</H1> <P>
In 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08527"> arXiv:2302.08527, </A>
A. Candido et al.'s approach combines a
machine-learning parametrization of experimental data with pQCD
calculations based on state-of-the-art analyses of proton and
nuclear parton distributions (PDFs).  The "NNSFnu" determination
is made available as fast interpolation LHAPDF grids and can be
accessed through a driver code at 
<A href="https://nnpdf.github.io/nnusf/">
https://nnpdf.github.io/nnusf/
</A>
or directly interfaced to neutrino event generators such as GENIE.

*** For the answer to last month's party question
</H1> <P>
see:  A. Smirnov and G. Zatsepin, "Can the neutrinos from Z0 decay
oscillate?," Mod. Phys. Lett. A [7] (1992), 1272-1280.

<H1>
*** Excavation continues at SURF for DUNE
</H1> <P>
The 400,000 tons of ore removed from the former Homestake gold
mine were not gold.  That much gold, at today's price of $1800 per
ounce would be 250 times the world's annual GDP.

<H1>
*** RANT:  hyphens again
</H1> <P>
As a stickler for the correct use of hyphens in long-baseline
experiments, I have been puzzled by the practice that many put a
hyphen in cross section when it is not being used as an adjective.
There exists guidance that you should not.  But Nature magazine
does.  To avoid ambiguous pronunciation, English does not allow
compound words with 3 consecutive identical letters (skull-like or
bee-eater) so there is a hyphen.  But nobody writes crosssection.
