*** New MINOS measurement of Delta m-squared 32
</H1> <P>
Fermilab's MINOS experiment has presented its oscillation fit 
results with twice the previously published Luminosity (now
2.5 10^20 protons-on-target).  The best fit is 2.38 +.20-.16 
10^-3 eV^2 and sin^2 2theta = 1.00 -.08+.00.  For energies below 
10 GeV, a deficit of 38% compared to no-osc hypothesis is seen.
The goal after the 2007 shutdown is to run stably at 2.5 10^13
ppp every 2.2 seconds, and in 2008-9 to improve the beam power
30-40% by stacking.

*** Neutrino Scientific Assessment Group recommendations 13jul07
</H1> <P>
NuSAG finds a continuing program designed to study CP violation
in the neutrino sector and to determine the hierarchy of the nu
mass spectrum is scientifically compelling.  1) The US should
proceed to extend sensitivity to theta-13,  2) Beam R&D for upgrades
to NuMI or a beam to DUSEL, 3) Water Cerenkov R&D 4) Liquid Argon
R&D.  "Planning and R&D should be ready for a technology decision
and a decision to proceed when the next round of results on th-13
becomes available, which could be as early as 2012.  A review of
the international program in neutrino oscillations and the 
opportunities for international collaboration should be included
in the decision to proceed."  This is NuSAG's "final" report:

*** Theorizing the High Energy Neutrinos
</H1> <P>
If Astronomical TEV photons come from pion decay, associated with
high energy protons, then neutrinos with the same energies must 
exist.  If, instead, photons come from high energy electrons, 
there won't be (many) neutrinos.  At ICRC, Francis Halzen reported 
checking astro-ph for the last year and the vote is 4-4.  If you 
write the next paper, you can break the tie.

<H1>
*** Looking for High Energy Neutrinos
</H1> <P>
A number of experiments are looking for or planning to look for
Very High Energy and Ultra High Energy Neutrinos -- Baikal, Ice 
Cube, Antares, NEMO, NESTOR, RICE, ANITA, AURA, SHALON, Auger, 
Auriana, AMANDA, Telescope Array and HIRES using neutrino 
telescopes, radio, or acoustic signals or looking for horizontal 
air showers.  There were extensive presentations at ICRC.

*** Looking for neutrinos/muons/Kaons/neutrinos
</H1> <P>
The MINOS experiment was built to study neutrinos, but it is the
first large deep underground experiment with a magnet and has 
accurately measured the charge ratio of atmospheric muons which 
start near 1 TeV to be mu+/mu- = 1.374.  Previous experiments from
100 MeV to 100 GeV all get close to 1.26.  Phil Schreiner noticed
that he could use Gaisser's muon spectrum equation (originally due
to Zatsepin & Kuzmin) to fit this result and extract the pi+/pi-
and K+/K- ratios in cosmic rays.  see 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.3815"> arXiv 0705.3815 </A>
& 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0538"> 0706.0538.
</A>
Cosmic ray modelers are now looking into SIBYLL, QGSJET, etc. to 
see if retuning is needed.  Above 1 TeV, most atmospheric neutrinos
come from K decay, and the neutrino and anti-neutrino cross sections
are different, so all the experiments listed above should care.

*** Consequence of the Super-Kamiokande Accident
</H1> <P>
Super-K III, running since the rebuild, now has a year of data.
Due to the 2001 accident, Super-K II ran with less phototube 
coverage than Super-K I or III.  To get the same performance in
Super-K II they had to improve the reconstruction algorithm.
Now they hope to lower the solar neutrino threshold in Super-K III
from 4.5 MeV in Super-K I.  The transition of solar neutrino 
oscillations between vacuum and matter-dominated oscillations
occurs near 3 MeV.

*** DUSEL to Homestake, South Dakota
</H1> <P>
The NSF announced selection of a UC-Berkeley proposal to produce a 
technical design for a Deep Underground Science and Engineering Lab
at Homestake.  A 22-member panel unanimously picked Homestake from 
4 proposals.  The team could receive $5M/year for 3 years to develop
the design.  A decision to construct/operate DUSEL entails further
approvals by NSF, the National Science Board, and Congress.

*** Is the neutrino mass growing?
</H1> <P>
The time evolution of a cosmological scalar field can be stopped 
by an increasing mass of the neutrinos. This leads to a transition 
from a cosmological scaling solution with dynamical dark energy at 
early time to a cosmological constant dominated universe at late 
time. The trigger for the transition is set at the time when the 
neutrinos become non-relativistic. The characteristic mass scale 
for dark energy is thus related to the neutrino mass, the only 
known particle physics scale in its vicinity. This explains the 
"why now problem" for dark energy. C. Wetterich,
