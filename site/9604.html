*** LSND doubles oscillation signal, including 1995 data</h1>
In a 29 page paper submitted to Physical Review, the LSND
collaboration reports their evidence for neutrino oscillations
from muon decay at rest to be 22 events with a background of 4.6.
If attributed to oscillations, this corresponds to an oscillation
probability (averaged over the experimental energy and spatial
acceptance) of (0.31 +0.11-0.10+- 0.05)%.  Inclusion of the 1995
data doubled the exposure from what had been earlier reported.
Analysis of the stopping muon data is still underway.

*** Neutrino Workshop in France in June</h1>
The VIIIth "Rencontres de Blois" will be held in Blois (France)
from June 8th, to June 12th this year. It is devoted to "Neutrinos,
Dark Matter and the Universe". A preliminary program can be found
at http://www.lal.in2p3.fr/LAL/CONF/Blois96/

*** Neutrino Workshop in Australia in November</h1>
A Topical Workshop on Neutrino Physics will be held at the Institute
for Theoretical Physics at the University of Adelaide, Australia from
October 31st until November 6th 1996. Information is available at
http://www.physics.adelaide.edu.au/itp/workshops/neutrino.html
or from the director Prof A W Thomas
(c/- email:, fax:61 8 303 3551).

*** NSF report calls for new reviews</h1>
The "Report of the NSF Special Emphasis Panel on Experimental
High Energy Physics", called the Cahn report by some, proposes
that existing review procedures be supplemented by reviews of
full collaborative programs.  It has a suggested schedule of
review dates, but in language which seems a bit strange to me,
it states, "The long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment
at Fermilab would be reviewed once the collaboration's
membership is established."

*** SNO milestone (Sudbury Neutrino Observatory)</h1>
SNO is being constructed in 4 parts; first the top half of the
geodesic structure, then the top half of the acrylic vessel,
followed by the bottom half of the acrylic and the bottom half of
the geodesic.  The upper two pieces were recently completed.
The plan to finish construction in Jan. '97, and fill by May.
Counters for nc events may deploy in November '97, after many
cosmogenics decay, but the schedule will depend on exp. rates.

*** Homestake recalibrated counters</h1>
The Argon from the homestake solar neutrino detector has been
measured in a number of proportional counters over the years,
most but not all of which still exist.  About 20 of the 30
counters have been recalibrated using Argon 37.  The present
result is 2.54 +- 0.14 +- .14 SNU.  Using data only from counters
which were recalibrated, the answer is 2.54 +- 0.20 SNU.

*** Gallex upgrades proposed</h1>
There is a proposal for a Gallium Neutrino Observatory (GNO) at
Gran Sasso in 3 stages:  GNO30, 1997-1999 would continue GALLEX by
purchasing the gallium which is currently in use.  It needs to be
purchased by the end of 1996.  GNO060, 1999-2001 would increase
the gallium, probably in chloride form.  GN100, 2001-2007 would
get more gallium, possibly in metallic form.

*** Superkamiokande</h1>
With a flip of the switch, Superkamiokande turned on at 00:01
on April 1, 1996, as promised.  During the fill, some dirt had
gotten into the water, and the attenuation length is short, but
it is growing as the water cleans up.  They expect 8400 solar
neutrinos per year with E.gt.5MeV.  Only 1/3% of the inner tubes
died during startup, and 2-3% of outer tubes.  Mu rate is 3Hz.

*** Birds in California (San Onofre, now Phoenix) </h1>
The San Onofre experiment was finding obstacles in the way of
constructing their facility near the reactor.  One concern was
that the construction would bother the San Onofre gnatcatcher, a
bird which nests near the reactor, though there is less concern
they are bothered by tanks which rumble by from an army base.  The
experiment has decided to move to the Palo Verde reactor near
Phoenix.  There they can build a deeper facility, which will
reduce cosmic muon backgrounds, but with 3 reactors, only one
of which is off at any given time, it will be a bit harder to
compare reactor on versus reactor off data.  Oscillation
sensitivity remains constant as a result.

*** Bats in Minnesota (MINOS) </h1>
As part of the MINOS environmental assessment, Dan Taylor and
a team from Bat Conservation International visited Soudan for
3 days to see if MINOS excavation might disturb the bat
population.  The dominant population (little brown myotis)
prefers to hibernate in 40-44 degree F temperatures, which is
not near the new MINOS hall.  No problems are foreseen.  Bat
Conservation International is at  http://www.batcon.org/

I have had some inconsistent failures reported to me for
users of this newsletter's web site.  If your bookmark/hotlist
isn't working, please let me know.  Soon the address might change.
