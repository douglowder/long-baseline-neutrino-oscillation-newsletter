Long-Baseline news, July 2008 
</H1> <P> 

<H1>
*** Long-Baseline in Europe - CERN CNGS Beam Restarted
</H1> <P> 
The CERN long-baseline neutrino beam from CERN to Gran Sasso
Italy has restarted as of June 18.  By July 7th, they've reached
1.16E18 POTs

*** Long-Baseline in America - NuMI Restarted
</H1> <P> 
MINOS is running again with a replacement horn.  A new "scenarios"
committee will study the mix of nu/anti-nu running after 2010.
The restarted NOvA project has once again passed its CD2 review.

<H1>
*** Long-Baseline in Japan - Main Ring Circulation at Tokai
</H1> <P> 
The T2K experiment will use a 50 GeV accelerator being built in
Japan.  In May, they injected beam from the 3 GeV ring to the 50
GeV ring for the first time.  The beam was captured by the RF 
and, then, extracted outside the ring, but was not accelerated.
They will accelerate to 30 GeV in Dec.  For the nu beam, they've 
installed 10 of 14 magnet doublets, the beam dump, and the 900t 
near detector magnet.  The 3rd horn was assembled at KEK.  
Assembling test of the target & 1st horn will be done in Aug.

*** Dr. Yoji Totsuka
</H1> <P> 
Yoji Totsuka, the former director general of KEK and an 
outstanding contributor to great advances in neutrino physics, 
died of cancer at the age of 66 on Thursday, July 10.
He had led the design and construction of the Super-Kamiokande
Detector.

*** Should a Theory of Everything include Neutrinos?
</H1> <P> 
The July 21, 2008 cover of the "New Yorker" has a cover with a 
controversial cartoon of Obama and his wife.  Inside is an article 
about a surfer dude who feels E8 is the Theory of Everything that
we need.  The New Yorker article and 
arXiv mention neutrinos, but 
without the prominence I require for "everything".

*** Predictions of Theta-13 (q13)
</H1> <P> 
Some theories do make predictions and are testable.  Datta
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.0420"> arXiv:0807.0420 </A>
predicts sin(q13) related to the deviation of 
sin(q12) from 1/sqrt(3), while the devision of sin(q23) from its 
tribimaximal value is related to m_mu/m_tau.   Porto & Zee's model
of the private Higgs (
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.0612"> arXiv:0807.0612) </A>
U_e3 ~ 0.02.  Jenkins and 
Manohar argue in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.4176"> arXiv:0807.4176 </A>
that any model with the exact
tribimaximal mixing (q13=0) does not have leptogenesis, and to get 
"adequately large lepton asymmetry" one needs q13>0.01.

<H1>
*** Measurement of the Neutrino Mass
</H1> <P> 
The sum of the masses of the three neutrino mass eigenstates is 
now constrained both from above and below, and lies between 55 
and 6900 meV. The lower limit is set by neutrino oscillations and 
the fact that masses are non-negative. The upper limit is set by 
laboratory measurements on the beta decay of tritium. The 
clustering on large scales in the universe depends on this 
quantity, and, within the framework of Lambda-CDM cosmology, 
favors a mass sum below about 600 meV. Robertson

*** Neutrinos at ICHEP (2008 International Conference on HEP)
</H1> <P> 
Neutrinos were the subject of 24 out 274 contributed talks at
ICHEP, 13 out of 160 posters, and 2 out of 40 plenary talks.
<A href="http://www.ichep08.com/"> http://www.ichep08.com/  </A>
Are we just 5-9% of the field?

<H1>
*** Neutrino Frontiers 23-26 October in Minneapolis
</H1> <P> 
This workshop will bring together theorists & experimenters
to discuss neutrinos, their effects on cosmological and 
astrophysical processes, and the interplay between theory 
and ongoing and future experiments.

*** Some Fermilab Directions
</H1> <P> 
Fermilab's Director wrote, "The need to focus on the P5 roadmap 
will exclude a set of experiments proposed for Fermilab in the 
next five years or so that arose from workshops but do not align 
with the P5 plan." For example, the PAC did not encourage NuSong 
or NuBooNE.

*** Oxford English Dictionary Neutrino definition updated
</H1> <P> 
The online OED was revised June 2008, presumably unrelated to last 
month's long-baseline news: "Each of three stable, uncharged 
leptons, associated respectively with the electron, the muon, and 
the tau lepton, which have very little mass and an extremely low 
probability of interaction with matter. Also: an antiparticle of 
any of these, one of which is produced (along with an electron 
and a proton) in the beta decay of a neutron."  Better...
