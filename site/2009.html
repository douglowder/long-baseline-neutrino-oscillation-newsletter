*** Tensions between T2K and NOvA
</h1> <p>
Collaborators on these two large neutrino experiments get along
very well.  And both experiments, analyzed alone, seem to favor
the normal neutrino mass order (m3&gt;m2&gt;m1).  But differences in the
delta and octant determination lead to the situation that a joint
fit of both experiments seems to favor the inverted mass order
(m2&gt;m1&gt;m3).  See, for example, K.Kelly et al. in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08526"> arXiv:2007.08526. </a>

*** Dual phase ProtoDUNE concludes 7 Sep
</h1> <p>
The dual phase prototype of ProtoDUNE ended running after testing
several aspects of this novel technology.  One problem was an
apparent short between an HV extender with a ring connected to the
field cage.  A mitigation exercise was done in June to remove some
of those connections.  An mp4 video of this procedure is available
at
<a href="https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/9HXtdxxw8YI2RbB">

</a>
The
photodetector system measured light changes with and without Xe &amp;
N_2 injections.  R&amp;D on HV and other issues is proceeding in
preparation for phase II of ProtoDUNE-DP.

*** If Betelgeuse goes boom...
</h1> <p>
This red giant is the 10th brightest star in the night sky, and is
a candidate for a supernova.  It is 700 light years distance, and
would be a prodigious source of neutrinos if that were to happen.

*** Basic Research Needs (BRN) Detector R&amp;D report available
</h1> <p>
The goal of the BRN study was to assess the present status of the
HEP physics and technology landscape, and to identify strategic
technology areas, aligned with the strengths of the US community,
that future long-term R&amp;D efforts should focus on in pursuit of
the HEP science drivers identified in the P5 report.  Neutrinos
are one of the five listed science drivers.

*** Interesting Letters of Interest; v1
</h1> <p>
Between now &amp; the 31 Jul 2021 deadline for Snowmass contributions,
this section will feature some of the 205 two-page neutrino LOIs
submitted for the study to define the most important questions
for the field of particle physics and to identify opportunities to
address them.

The "Hyper-Kamiokande Experiment", Hyper-Kamiokande
is the next generation underground water Cherenkov detector that
builds on the highly successful Super-Kamiokande experiment.
Starting in 2027, it will obtain 3.8 Mt-yr of exposure over 20
years and measure nus from the upgraded JPARC beam.

"Ocean Bottom Detector", Currently,
continental detectors KamLAND and Borexino are measuring traits
of geoneutrinos, 70% of which are from the earth's crust.  An
ocean bottom detector would focus more on nus from the earth's
mantle.  Development tests will begin in 2022.
