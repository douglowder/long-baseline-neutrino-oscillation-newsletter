*** MEYERS and BEIER ENQUIRE; NUSAG questions
</h1>
The panel advising U.S. agencies on new neutrino programs asked
the proponents of the new projects several questions.  Reactor
questions were due 6/30; 0nu-betabeta earlier, accelerator later.
NuSAG has made available a public page with the May presentations:

*** U.S. House ADMIRES neutrinos, Senate doesn't CONSPIRE
</h1>
The House Appropriations committee added $22M to the President's
DOE Science budget of $714M, with $11M "provided for upgrades to
the neutrino research program".  The Senate bill was for $717M
with no mention of neutrinos.  These things get worked out later.

*** ENTIRE universe seen by Auger with North proposal for Colorado
</h1>
The Auger array is nearing completion and will hold a celebration
9-11 November 2005 in Malargue Argentina.  Meanwhile, they chose a site in
Southeastern Colorado for a Northern Hemisphere proposal.

*** Louis RETIRES "Old Red";  misses frequent FLYER miles
</h1>
Louis Barrett, Western Washington Physicist who has been
driving to Minnesota for Soudan 2 and MINOS experiments for
several years, told people last year that he was going to "retire"
his car after reaching 1/2 million miles, which he did at the end
of last summer.  Several were surprised this year to see him in
the same '87 Prelude with 552,000 miles.  It had new tires.

*** Neutrinos racing to the WIRE
</h1>
Regarding the Neutrinos at the Main Injector project at FNAL,
Office of Science Director Ray Orbach declared "we're in a race"
with the strategy being to run the machine as much as possible.

*** ASPIRE no HIGHER at deep science Workshop, SNOLAB 15-17 Aug
</h1>
One of the word's deepest science mines has a very high stack:

*** Need BUYER DESIRING power in WIRES.  Stupid Nu patent:
</h1>
United States Patent 6891310, "Neutrino light to photon light
converting matrix", Issued on May 10, 2005
<a href="http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6891310.html">
http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6891310.html  </a>
I'm not sure if
this should make me a laugher or CRIER;  or raise my IRE!
Where can I object that they have patented "A FORCE MODEL OF THE
UNIVERSE AND THE ROLE OF NEUTRINOS"?

*** Fermilab Neutrino Department PERSPIRES
</h1>
A hot week at Fermilab saw the establishment of the new neutrino
department, led by Gina Rameika.  It oversees four experiments -
MINOS, MiniBooNE, MINERvA and NOvA.  Fermilab's recently HIRED
new DIRECTOR Pier Oddone spent his 1st day in Sweden.  (Pier
doesn't rhyme with plier.)

*** MIPP ACQUIRES NuMI target data
</h1>
MIPP has started taking beam on the NuMI target.  Particle
production measured in MIPP may aid tuning nu Monte Carlos for
MINOS.

*** Kayser Neutrino lecture notes
</h1>
As many competent particle physicists move from collider and B
physics to neutrinos, they need a short but clear overview of
the current status of neutrino physics.  The writeup of neutrino
lectures at the SLAC summer school in
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0506165"> hep-ph/0506165 </a>
is such.
