*** [2 weeks] since SNO results were on Nightline
</h1>
Last month rumors abounded that SNO results would be out in 2
weeks.  They measure a CC rate which is 0.347 +- 0.029 the
prediction of BP2001.  Combining their measurement of CC with the
Super-K combination of NC+CC, it is shown from the NC rate that the
total flux of neutrinos (5.4 10^6 /cm^2/s) is in close agreement
with solar models.  This strengthens the conclusion that the
low solar CC rate is due to neutrino oscillations.

*** [Several] Accidents delay NuMI Project
</h1>
The NuMI projects was stopped and restarted in late June as the
result of several lost-time accidents.  The most recent, (6/21) an
employee of Layne-Western, a subcontractor of S.A. Healy, was
injured as a result of equipment failure while operating a
drilling rig.   Because of the string of accidents that have
occurred on NuMI, Fermilab director Mike Witherell a halt to
NuMI construction until there were assurances the project would
proceed safely. A phased restart of NuMI was approved 6/29.

*** [90 years old] and the UNO document

Maurice Goldhaber spent his 90th birthday at a meeting of the UNO
neutrino/nucleon decay collaboration helping to craft a proposal
for this 0.5 Megaton detector.  The proposal is available at
<a href="http://nngroup.physics.sunysb.edu/uno/">

*** [T600] ICARUS sees tracks
</h1>
Half the 735 ton (Argon) module in Pavia is full &amp; sees cosmicray
tracks up to 18 m long.  Nominal HV is 75 kV.  Impurities are
less than 1 ppb O equivalent, (design 0.1) Attenuation &gt;1.5m.
After commissioning, the module will be taken to Gran Sasso.

*** [&lt;300,000 km/s]  in a long-baseline experiment.
</h1>
MINOS plans to measure the oscillations in the energy
distribution of nu_mu from Fermilab.  A new idea is to improve
timing to look for time-of-flight delays.  It is the mass
eigenstates nu_1, _2 and _3 which would travel with a fixed
velocity.  Oscillations arise from wavepackets of e.g. nu_2 and
nu_3 being shifted but overlapping.  The time spread of the nu
emission precludes an interesting time-of-flight measurement.
But if MINOS did measure a time of flight difference between
neutrinos, it would not measure any energy oscillations.

*** [&gt;300,000 km/s] &amp; NuMI delays
</h1>
<a href="numidelay.html">

Besides accidents, NuMI is faced with cost overruns and schedule
delays.  A Lehman review "rebaselining" to redefine the schedule
wasn't approved in May but might be in Aug.  The overrun is ~$30M
which increases the project cost from ~$140M to ~$170M, but the
detector is on schedule while the delays and additional costs
affect the beam.  The steel for the first far detector plane was
delivered to Soudan last week.  On the bright side, if the
detector is finished on schedule, and runs for two years or so
before the beam turns on, that will increase the parameter range
sensitivity to beam tachyons(?).  Well, at least cosmic rays.

*** [$2.2 Billion] for Homestake gold; neutrinos are free
</h1>
Toronto-based Barrick Gold Corp said Monday that it is acquiring
Homestake Mining Co., one of the oldest U.S. mining operations
and owner of the legendary Homestake mine in the Black Hills of
South Dakota.   In a $2.2B stock deal Barrick, one of the largest
gold producers in the world, said it would take over Homestake and
create a combined company with a market capitalization of $9B,
double its nearest rival.  The National Underground Science Lab
(NUSL) was brought up during negotiations, and no one objected to
staying on course for the transition.
