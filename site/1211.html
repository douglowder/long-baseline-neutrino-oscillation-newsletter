*** Fermilab's Raaf:  a hands-on neutrino physicist
</h1> <p>
Fermilab's Jennifer Raaf works on MicroBooNE and LBNE.  She was
featured in the DOE Pulse, a newsletter of Science and Technology
Highlights from the DOE National Laboratories.

*** Physicists brave hurricane Sandy to keep LBNE on schedule
</h1> <p>
The CD1 review was held at Fermilab during hurricane Sandy, so many
physicists from BNL and reviewers from DC could only connect
remotely if at all.  But the meeting went on and the review was done.

</p><h1>
*** LBNE gets closer to CD1
</h1> <p>
During a cost and schedule review last month, LBNE presented the new
long-baseline neutrino beam from Fermilab to South Dakota with a
10 kiloton Liquid Argon detector on the surface.  DOE has since
raised the cost guidance/profile to the presented $867M.

</p><h1>
*** KamLAND fire
</h1> <p>
There was a fire in the parking lot of the KamLAND experiment
(underground in Japan) which disrupted power for at least a week.
There was no damage to the experiment.

</p><h1>
*** New LBNE co-spokesperson
</h1> <p>
Robert Wilson from Colorado State University is the new cospokesperson
for LBNE for 2013-2014, joining Milind Diwan from Brookhaven.  He is
no relation to Fermilab's founder of the same name.

</p><h1>
*** NOvA Near Detector Hall Excavation Completed
</h1> <p>
Started at the beginning of Fermilab's current shutdown,
excavation of the NOvA Near-Detector Cavern is complete. Workers
have installed a new concrete floor over the exposed bedrock to be
level with that of the existing facility. Workers will next
install the infrastructure necessary to support the future near
detector, including steel platforms and ceiling, electrical and
mechanical utilities, fire doors &amp; walls and other safety devices.

</p><h1>
*** Double Chooz Near Detector Hall Excavation Completed
</h1> <p>
Blasting rock near the site of an operating nuclear reactor is
problematic and caused delays, but the site for the second
Double Chooz detector is done and outfitting is in progress.

*** Contingency for NOvA
</h1> <p>
The 14 kiloton NOvA experiment is finishing the construction of
its 5th block out of 28 at the far detector and hopes to start
filling soon with scintillator.  But the contingency is being used
up faster than desirable, and the DOE wants NOvA to identify how
to get $10M more in contingency through some savings, but without
giving up detector mass.  One idea that has been mentioned is to
fill up downstream modules with water and not instrument them, for
a mu catcher, but this gives a smaller fiducial volume for electron
neutrino identification than just having a smaller detector.

</p><h1>
*** Contingency for Sequestration?
</h1> <p>
A change in the US funding of everything might happen next month,
with the obscure name "sequestration", which basically means cuts
in all spending which of course includes U.S. neutrino physics.
The press can't handle a long word, so they call it "fiscal cliff".
Up to now, there has not been contingency planning, because it was
thought we wouldn't need it.  One idea that has not been mentioned
is to fill our offices with water.

</p><h1>
*** NuMI exploitation, GLADE, CHIPS and Lake Superior
</h1> <p>
A group interested in further ways to use the NuMI beam has started
meetings.  The scope and transparencies from the first meeting are
accessible at
<a href="http://www-hep.physics.wm.edu/~vahle/enumi/">
http://www-hep.physics.wm.edu/~vahle/enumi/.  </a>
Ideas
include GLADE, a liquid argon detector behind NOvA; CHIPS, a water
Cherenkov detector in a mine pit along the Mesabi Range of Northern
Minnesota; and a large water detector in Lake Superior.  Also NOvA
upgrades and MINOS++.

</p><h1>
*** Stuart Freedman 1944-2012
</h1> <p>
Berkeley's Stuart Freedman had a distinguished career in
experimental physics.  Among many other accomplishments, he helped
to resolve the 17 KeV neutrino claims.  He worked on KamLAND and
CUORE and helped to establish the current generation of reactor
theta-13 experiments.  A Freedman fellowship for a top graduate
student is being established at UC Berkeley.  Donations are
welcome.

*** Messing with Texas
</h1> <p>
Neutrino physicists are pouring into Texas.  The December 2012
collaboration meeting of LBNE was in Houston; The January 2013
meeting of NOvA is in Dallas and MINOS+ is meeting then in
Austin.  I asked a friend from Texas if he was upset that the
Higgs was not found in Texas.  He said yes.  There is also the
issue, as discussed by Riva et al., "Is the 125 GeV Higgs the
superpartner of a neutrino?"
