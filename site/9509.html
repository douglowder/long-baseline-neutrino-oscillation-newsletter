</p><h1>*** HEPAP approves/transmits Sciulli report </h1>
In a letter from Hepap Subpanel chair Frank Sciulli to Acting
Chair Piermaria Oddone:  "The very high flux Fermilab Main
Injector, built primarily to provide improved colliding beam
rates, has the potential to provide a neutrino beam of unique
capabilities for the field of neutrino oscillation science.  It
is incumbent upon our community to exploit existing capabilities
in novel ways so as to provide the best physics for the money."
The subpanel report (60 pages plus appendices) mentioned three
reasons for preferring MINOS to BNL E889  -- greater discovery
potential for dmsq &lt; .02 eV^2, -- higher event rates, larger
variety of signatures, and the option of an NBB, -- COSMOS with
MINOS is cost effective.  They also wrote, "a failure to confirm
atmospheric neutrino anomalies should not affect the decision to
proceed with the MINOS experiment", and "regardless of NOMAD and
CHORUS results, COSMOS will remain interesting."   BNL Assoc.
Director Tom Kirk and 889 cospokesman Al Mann each spoke to HEPAP
10 minutes, expressing polite disagreement that the subpanel thought
the US couldn't compete with the Japan on discovery.  Al Mann
suggested that for $15M they could mount a quick 2-detector
experiment to Connecticut as good as KEK to SuperK.  HEPAP
members accepted the FNAL/BNL decision but some expressed doubts
that US-HEP could afford a new program at all.  They passed on
the report to Martha Krebs and the DOE unanimously.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Martha Krebs visits FNAL, ANL-- two days of neutrinos</h1>
Just as she was getting the subpanel report, DOE undersecretary
Martha Krebs attended on-site reviews at Fermilab and Argonne
where she heard about NuMI and MINOS from R. Rameika &amp; L Price.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Next for NuMI is Key Decision Zero.  (Not a joke)</h1>
DOE is drafting NuMI's Key Decision Zero(KD-0).  Here's a KD guide:
<p>
KD-0: "Permission to think" - One can work on conceptual design.
</p><p>
KD-1: "Permission to think deeply" - One can develop Title I -
Means that major permitting has been accomplished, usually.
</p><p>
KD-2: "Permission to do detailed designs" - One can develop Title II -
Detailed engineering construction drawings.  All permitting in place.
</p><p>
KD-3: "You can build it" - Until now, no money can go for anything
real - up to this point it's all paper.
</p><p>
KD-4: "You can use it" - It may exist, but you can't use it until DOE
approves that it is o.k. to use it.

</p><h1>*** Solar calibration results at TAUP 95 look good.</h1>
Sage presented preliminary first 51Cr source calibration results:
Measured/Expected = 0.93 + 0.15/-0.17.  Gallex final result from
11 runs is 0.97 +- 0.11.  Preliminary from 7 runs had been 1.02.

<p>
</p><h1>*** ICRC atmospheric neutrino workshop;  Neutron problem?</h1>
At the Rome ICRC atmospheric neutrino workshop Olga Ryashkaya
(O.R.) listed the mu/e neutrino ratios as a function of depth
showing that it went from .54 at shallow to 1.00 deeper.  Her
prediction of neutron rates underground matched measurements at
LVD.  She  predicted rates at other depths.  Using Kamiokande
data in 5 equal volumes, she showed there were relatively more
muon neutrinos in the center of the detector (which she
suggested could be detection difficulties), but more electron
neutrinos near the edge, as one might expect from neutron
initiated showers.  During the talk you could hear a pin drop.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Workshop on weak interactions-No neutron problem</h1>
At the Talloires Workshop, Kamiokande, IMB-3 and Soudan all showed
data which disputed the (O.R.) neutron hypothesis.  In Soudan
there was no exterior pile-up.  In Kamiokande, neutron single
shower rates predicted by O.R. would entail abundant 2-shower
rates near the wall with well measured vertices.  Not seen.
Ditto IMB.  In IMB the distribution of single ring events in the
variable "DISTWALL", distance from the vertex to a wall, projected
along the track, showed that showers are systematically shifted
away from the wall while tracks are not.    If the Monte Carlo
simulation is good, then there is no problem.  But the effective
volume is different for e and mu-like events, which is worrisome.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Near future for Shortbaseline, reactor, atmo experiments</h1>
NOMAD became fully instrumented mid-August.  They expect 700K cc
events per year(1.2 10^19 pot).  CHORUS expects 320K cc by end of
1995, with analysis by end 1996.  CHOOZ and San Onofre reactor
experiments may get underway in 1996.  New Soudan 2 atmospheric
data is due soon.  SuperK will fill with water next month and
detector turn-on remains on-target for April 1996.

<p>
</p><h1>** Minnesota money sought for MINOS from IRRRB</h1>
MINOS, the Minnesota-Illinois Neutrino Oscillation Search, is
having discussions with the IRRRB about partial funding of
the expanded hall at Soudan.  That's the Iron Range Resources and
Rehabilitation Board.  They have a sizable amount of money obtained
from a taconite tax on local mining which is to be used for
creating jobs when the mines run out of ore.  Previous projects
include subsidies for the "IRONWORLD" theme park, and help for a
chopsticks factory in Hibbing.  MINOS has attracted attention from
the local county commissioners to US Senator Paul Wellstone, and a
meeting was held in Eveleth Sept. 29th to discuss funding.
