</p><h1>*** LSND</h1>
LSND reports a signal for nuebars in a beam with no nuebars, which
could be due to oscillations.  They see 30-50 MeV positron followed
by a 2.2 MeV gamma, coincident in time and space.  They parameterize
the time/space coincidence in a likelihood ratio R and get something like:
R  Events  Backgrounds      Event         Oscillation
beam-off beam-on excess        Probability
no cut 83     30.8  14.8      37.4  8.8 +- 2.1  10^-3
R&gt;0    33     10.5   4.9      17.6  6.1 +- ?    10^-3
R&gt;1.5  22      5.0   2.4      14.6  5.5 +- ?    10^-3
R&gt;30   10      0.7   0.6       8.7  8.7 +- 3.2  10^-3
Do they understand their backgrounds?  We'll have to see their preprint,
coming soon, but see Neutrino '94 pp 229-234 Nucl Phys B38 for a preview.

</p><h1>*** Karmen </h1>
They report P&lt; 3 10^-3 which is sin^2(2-theta) &lt; 6 10^-3 at high dm^2.
Other relevant limits come from BNL776, 734, 764 and 645.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Galvin Report</h1>
The Galvin Task Force Report on the "Alternative Futures for
the Department of Energy National Laboratories" did not choose
any of the multi-purpose labs for closure.  It specifically supported
continued near term support for  Los Alamos Neutron Scattering Experiment/Los
Alamos Meson Physics Facility (LANSCE/LAMPF), which has bounced between
Nuclear Physics and the military and occasionally been in the air.

<p>
</p><h1>*** MINOS Proposal</h1>
The MINOS group completed their proposal with a cover reflecting Greek
myths about neutrino mass prepared by Angela Gonzalez.  A recent addition
to MINOS is the Houston group led by Kwong Lau.  The reference MINOS
detector is 10 kton with a cost estimate $13.5M + $4.1M/kton

<p>
</p><h1>*** CERN meeting March 1st; Gran Sasso meeting March 23/24</h1>
There is a one day meeting on March 1st at CERN on Long Baseline experiments
at Gran Sasso.  For information contact  or 39575::long.
There will be a workshop on ``Future Experiments at Gran Sasso" on March
23/24th at Gran Sasso.  These meetings will strengthen the Cern-GS neutrino
beam case and define the scientific case for such a project.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Fermilab PAC</h1>
The Fermilab PAC heard the first MINOS presentation in February.
They wrote, " The committee will consider this proposal for Stage I
approval at its April meeting.  This represents early approval, with
respect to the timetable laid out in June 1994, and is in recognition
of the great progress made by the collaboration."

<p>
</p><h1>*** HEPAP subpanel on long baseline neutrinos</h1>
At the March 4th HEPAP meeting, a subpanel is expected to be presented
to HEPAP.  It will be led by Frank Sciulli and members are R. Lanou,
F. Merritt, G. Feldman, P. Rosen, W. Ford, H. Sobel and T.Y. Ling.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Nomad rebuilding chambers</h1>
NOMAD took only limited data during the last CERN neutrino run because
of two problems in their chambers.  One early problem due to wires breaking
at solder joints has been fixed.  Another problem came from an
unfortunate choice of glue for the cathode strips of the drift chambers.
Most, but not all, of the NOMAD detector will be ready for the next
run in April, with the full detector reaching completion in July.  Both
CHORUS and Nomad have been approved for continued running in 96 &amp; 97.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Threefold Maximal mixing </h1>
Last month I reported on a preprint on this subject from Harrison, Perkins
&amp; Scott.  Note a similar paper below by Giunti, Kim &amp; Kim.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Nuclear Physics White Paper; DPF Neutrino Report</h1>
A nuclear physics white paper, prepared at three workshops over the last
three years, briefly mentions present and future neutrino oscillation
experiments.  A hadron probes white paper, available at
http://www.iucf.indiana.edu/IUCF/hadron_white_paper.html barely mentions
neutrinos at all.  Also, the chapter on neutrinos for the DPF study report
is complete.  This is a very excellent review of the present status of
neutrino physics; coordinated by P. Langacker, R. Rameika and H. Robertson.

</p><h1>*** repeat--NuMI notes on World Wide Web (This is not long baseline news)</h1>
A page with the NuMI index and about 1/3 of the notes themselves is now on
World Wide Web:  http://www.hep.anl.gov/Hypertext/NDK/numi_notes.html
