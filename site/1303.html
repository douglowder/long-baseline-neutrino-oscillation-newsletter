*** OPERA sees third tau neutrino
</H1> <P>
The long-baseline emulsion neutrino appearance experiment has 
reported a third tau neutrino from numu to nutau oscillations 
in the CNGS beam.  After 5 years they have 1.8e20pot (protons on 
target), 20% less than the proposal of 2.25. They also have 19 
electron neutrinos and 50 charm events.

*** New results and a new challenge for RENO
</H1> <P>
RENO showed new results on electron neutrino disappearance from 6 
powerful reactors in Korea at the Neutrino Telescopes meeting.  
With double the statistics and improved analysis and background 
rejection, they measure sin^2(2 theta13) = 0.100 +- 0.010 +- 0.015
with 400 days data.  But on 13 Oct 2012, a tiny fraction of a Cf 
calibration source dissolved in the liquid scintillator, in part 
due to a loose O ring.  The CF is at the bottom of the target, as 
shown by the vertex distribution.  The prompt energy distribution 
is wide, until Cf events are removed with a "multiplicity cut".

*** Planck
</H1> <P>
Planck is a European Space Agency mission, accepted in 1996 to map 
the Cosmic Microwave Background with much higher resolution than 
WMAP.  The CMB provides constraints on the sum of neutrino masses, 
this constraint is coming closer to the ~0.1 eV level expected 
from oscillation scenarios.  Planck's CMB data-only constraints 
set the sum of neutrino masses to be less than 0.66-0.85 eV
(depending on the choice of CMB data used).  BAO results help to 
break the geometric degeneracy in the angular-diameter distance to
last scattering (which is sensitive to the neutrino mass), and 
improve the limit.  Including these, the 95%CL upper limit is 
0.23 eV (assuming spatial flatness).  The effective number of nu 
species, N_eff, is measured by Planck (plus other CMB data) to be 
3.36 +/- 0.7, adding BAO pulls it down to 3.30 +/- 0.5, adding H_0 
moves it up to 3.62 +/- 0.5.  The Planck team appears to give most 
weight to N_eff~3.3. In any case, Planck argues for no compelling 
evidence against the canonical N_eff=3.046.

*** Facilities Report for US Office of Science
</H1> <P>
Every ten years, the Office of Science makes a ranked
list of new big facilities in the US Department of Energy.
This year big means more than $100M.  The Advisory panel
for each office sends in an unranked list.  The list for
High Energy Physics, and the charge, is available at

*** NOvA award and events
</H1> <P>
The NOvA Far-Detector Laboratory in Ash River, Minn., has earned a 
National Recognition Award in the American Council of Engineering 
Companies 2013 Engineering Excellence awards competition.
The building has a large span but also some overburden to shield
cosmic rays.   The award will be given in DC in April.  Meanwhile,
NOvA's far detector has recorded its first 3D particle tracks:

*** Lev Mikaelyan passes away in Moscow
</H1> <P>
We are sad to report the passing of Lev Mikaelyan, a long-time 
neutrino physicist and the first one that I heard propose a new 
generation of reactor neutrino experiments to measure theta-13,  
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0008046"> 
http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0008046.  
</A>
Before Double Chooz, Daya 
Bay and RENO, the International Working Group on Reactor Neutrinos 
was considering Krasnoyarsk, an underground site, and Lev arranged 
a visit, only to have it canceled at the last minute by local 
authorities. He wrote us "Better schreckliche Ende than Schrecken 
ohne ende," i.e. better a disastrous end than endless disasters.

*** Two new results from Borexino
</H1> <P>
As Kepler knew but Galileo didn't, the earth is in an elliptical
orbit of the Sun.  This should give a 6.8% seasonal modulation
peak to peak of the solar neutrino flux.  Using a Lomb-Scargle
analysis of the Beryllium 7 data, Borexino excludes no seasonal
effect at more than 3 sigma.  With 613 ton-years of data, they
measure 14.3+-4.4 geoneutrinos after background subtraction, 
corresponding to 38.8 Terrestrial Neutrino Units (TNU) from U
and Th in the earth's crust.
