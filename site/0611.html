*** NuMI world's most powerful neutrino beam 
</H1> <P>
The 2007 Guinness book of world records says so:

Well it's not "super", and Lampf had more power and more
neutrinos, but the neutrinos were isotropic; i.e. not a beam.

<H1>
*** "SNuMI (SuperNuMI) phase 1" renamed "proton plan phase 2"
</H1> <P>
NOvA is near CD-1 level approval.  The project will be approved 
assuming increased neutrino fluxes resulting from upgrading the 
Fermilab accelerators and the NuMI beamline. A Super NuMI (SNuMI) 
plan to upgrade the proton intensity on target, the NuMI beamline, 
and target hall components following the shutdown of p-pbar was 
reviewed at Fermilab in November.  This plan utilizes parts of the 
accelerator complex that will be available in that time frame and 
envisions upgrading power levels in two phases. SNuMI Phase I goal
is 700 KW and the Phase II goal is 1.2 MW.  A Conceptual Design 
Report has been prepared for Phase I describing the steps to be 
taken to operate the Booster at high rates, re-fit the Recycler as
a proton preinjector to MI, and modify the MI and NuMI beamline 
for more intense beams. A conceptual strategy for incorporating 
the Accumulator for momentum stacking was discussed as a key 
component of achieving the Phase II power goal. The success of 
SNuMI depends critically on the success of the Proton Plan. Both 
Phases I & II have some technical risk for which accelerator 
physics simulations are recommended to address before the systems 
are built.  The base costs (no G&A, Contingency, or escalation) in 
FY06$ were presented for Phases I & II as $33.4M and $53.6M.

*** NUSEL renamed DUSEL but may be called SUSEL
</H1> <P>
T. Denny Sanford, a banker/financier from South Dakota (Many
credit card payments in the U.S. are mailed to South Dakota)
announced a $70M gift to Homestake.  $15M by 12/07; $20M 12/08
for the 4850 Homestake level infrastructure, $20M for a science
center in 09 and $15M by 12/12 for a 7400 level lab.  This 
generous gift has several triggers, including the naming of
the lab as the Sanford Underground Science & Engineering Lab.

<H1>
*** Should the Underground Science lab at Soudan be SUSEL?
</H1> <P>
The Soudan Underground Science and Engineering Lab is
a possibility and is the one site in the U.S. that already has
a neutrino beam aimed at it.   The number of lab sites worth
considering may be back to 4 with a site of a former rail tunnel
near the Cascade Tunnel in Washington.

*** Neutrino renamed by PDG?
</H1> <P>
The nu_e, nu_mu and nu_tau aren't really particles.  But we don't
know everything about nu_1, nu_2 and nu_3 yet.  We don't know, for
example, if nu_3 is the heaviest or lightest nu.  In the particle
listings for the 2006 RPP, the neutrinos don't have names.
In the new version of the popular Particles and Interactions 
chart, they are called, nu_lightest, nu_middle and nu_heaviest.

*** NOvA occasionally named EvA
</H1> <P>
As NOvA prepares for CD2, and awaits the signing of CD1, CD0 had
been given to the same project under the name of "Electron Nu
Appearance" or Eva.  This may have been motivated by a conversation
in which U.S. Science Director Orbach asked "What is NOvA for?" 
answered "Electron neutrino appearance", and  "Why don't you 
call it that?" together with Orbach's wife name of Eva.

*** Keeping names the same;  MINOS/NOvA elections
</H1> <P>
Stan Wojcicki of Stanford has been reelected as co-spokesperon 
of MINOS.  Gary Feldman of Harvard has been renominated without 
competition  as co-spokesperson of NOvA.

<H1>
*** Elections in Italy affect neutrinos
</H1> <P>
A new government in Italy seems keen to balance their budget and 
has proposed tax increases and spending cuts.  This has squeezed
the Italian funding agency INFN, which has had to discourage any
new project starts.   For example, significant Italian 
participation in NOvA has been nixed.

<H1>
*** The neutrino vote, elections in New Mexico
</H1> <P>
One way to get votes is to arrange that two weeks before an 
election, you have your face on the cover of a magazine with a
famous neutrino physicist.  This is what New Mexico Governor
Richardson did 
<A href="http://www.neutrinooscillation.org/governor.jpg">
http://www.neutrinooscillation.org/governor.jpg
</A>
with Neutrino 2006 organizer Tom Bowles.  The ploy worked and
Richardson was reelected 363926 to 170352.  Now Richardson has
7% in a 2008 Democratic presidential preference poll.

<H1>
*** MINERvA progress
</H1> <P>
MINERvA will have a (simultaneous) CD123a review in Germantown
in December.  Minerva, an experiment to be installed in the
Fermilab NuMI beam, will make precise cross section measurements
that are crucial for present and future long-baseline oscillation
experiments.  It will also study nuclear effects by using a 
variety of nuclear targets.

<H1>
*** Neutrino radiation cleared in death of spy Litvinenko
</H1> <P>
Since polonium 210 emits alpha particles, the only neutrinos would
come in a 3rd order Weak process.  Just to be sure, I asked two
theorists to calculate the dose.  He and she both said no.
