*** IUPAP seeks neutrino feedback
</h1> <p>
The International Union of Pure and Applied Physics has set up a
neutrino panel to promote international cooperation for neutrino
studies and promote international collaboration.  Visit
<a href="https://www.iupapneutrinopanel.org/ ">
https://www.iupapneutrinopanel.org/
</a>
to read the report and provide
comments and feedback by the 29 August 2021 deadline.

</p><h1>
*** Snowmass Neutrino Frontier activities.
</h1> <p>
Activity for Snowmass has resumed.  The whitepaper deadline is
15 Mar 2022.  Keep up to date at

*** Newsletter format issues
</h1> <p>
I think I am now avoiding the ugliest aspects of the URL mangling
from proofpoint.  That was the reason I started attaching the html
version last year.  But attachments cause some email clients to
reject email, so now I will instead provide  a link to the web
version at the top.  Note that the web version includes better
links for the arXiv and Snowmass papers than the text version.

</p><h1>
*** Do you need to update your email address or unsubscribe?
</h1> <p>
Each month, ~100 newsletters of the 2500 subscribers get returned
due to "headers too large" or "too many hops".  Neither issue do I
understand.  I try to update emails if I can, but it is getting
harder (e.g. hepnames no longer has emails).  Please update your
email if needed, or tell me.  Unsubscribe if you don't read it,
but if you think it helpful, suggest it to young colleagues.

*** DES measures some neutrino parameters
</h1> <p>
DES has its 3 year data where it analyzed large-scale structure
combining three two-point correlation functions (3x2pt).  DES
alone doesn't distinguish between the sum nu mass and the matter
density.  Combining with DES 3x2pt data, other low-redshift data,
and Planck CMB, they find s=m1+m2+m3 &lt; 130 meV (95%CL).
See the recent preprint in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13549"> arXiv:2105.13549. </a>

</p><h1>
*** rant - understanding neutrino parameters from cosmology
</h1> <p>
In the normal (inverted) mass order, s=m1+m2+m3 &gt; 59 (100) meV.
If as DES says, s &lt; 130 meV, degenerate solutions are impossible.
But DES "...model(s) massive neutrinos as three degenerate species
of equal mass."   It's been 34 years since we suspected neutrino
masses were different and 23 years since that was accepted.  Why
don't cosmology "measurements" of neutrino parameters do it right?

*** Steven Weinberg's last three minutes; 1933-2021

A colleague at UT once asked Weinberg if there was neutrino mass in
the Standard Model.  He told her "not in my Standard Model".  Making
the rounds are Weinberg's "Four Golden Lessons"

*** Workshop on Supernova neutrinos 18-19 October at LNGS

This workshop at LNGS and also online will cover the Legacy and
strategy for Supernova Neutrino detection with detectors located
at LNGS.

*** MINERvA Data Preservation Project
</h1> <p>
MINERνA has a huge amount of data, different nuclear targets etc.,
so it has started a dedicated effort in order to preserve the
collaboration’s data so it remains usable into the DUNE era.  It
involves a master AnaTuple: A unified ROOT file that contains low-
and high-level reconstruction objects used to reproduce MINERνA’s
results, and MAT, a framework with functionalities that allow
easy cross-section extractions centralized across an experiment.

*** Comment on "Observation of a Nu Burst from the SN1987A"'
</h1> <p>
It is 34 years after the fact, and we hear about possible deadtime
caused by tape writing errors in Kamiokande from Y. Oyama in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01783"> arXiv:2108.01783 </a>.
It's interesting but he doesn't mention that
all of his probabilities are a-posteriori (not really meaningful)
&amp; he combines them by multiplying them together which is wrong.

***  Planetary Neutrino Monitoring System , PLEvM

A proposal for neutrino telescopes to get together to share rare
high E events, similar to SNEWS, is proposed in
