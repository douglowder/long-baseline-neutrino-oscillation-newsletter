*** Are neutrino mixing parameters energy dependent?
</H1> <P>
Renormalization-group running of oscillation parameters between
the nu-mass-generating scale and the weak scale has been long 
studied.  But to be phenomenologically interesting, new physics
associated with light degrees of freedom that couple to neutrinos.
Babu et al. in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11961"> arXiv:2108.11961 </A>
consider quantum corrections
associated to the virtual exchange of the new degrees of freedom
that modify nu production and detection.  This can lead to
observable consequences in long-baseline nu experiments, such as
T2K and NOvA. 

<H1>
*** New neutrino parameters from NOvA
</H1> <P>
In M. A. Acero et al., "An Improved Measurement of Neutrino
Oscillation Parameters by (NOvA)" the NOvA collaboration with a
50% increase in neutrino-mode beam exposure over the previously
reported results. The additional data, combined with previously 
published nu and antinu data, are all analyzed using improved
techniques and simulations.  Delta m^2_32 = 2.41 +- 0.07 10^(-3)
eV^2 and sin^2(q_23) = 0.57 +0.03 -004.  See 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08219"> arXiv:2108.08219 </A>

<H1>
*** Cosmology neutrino mass tests
</H1> <P>
Last month I complained that DES had ruled out three degenerate 
neutrino masses in a calculation that assumed degenerate neutrino
masses.  Some cosmologists have pointed out to me that the main
cosmological observable is the sum of the masses and a degenerate
spectrum should be regarded as an approximation that has no impact
given the precision of current and likely future experiments.
Sec. 7.1 of the CORE proposal 
(<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00021"> arXiv:1612.00021 </A>) simulated CMB
data assuming the normal nu mass order.  They show that analyzing
the data assuming a degenerate spectrum is a good approximation.

<H1>
*** Curious referee comments on neutrinos
</H1> <P>
A referee comment on Ray Davis' 1955 first upper limit on neutrino
production in the sun was, "Any experiment such as this which does
not have the requisite sensitivity, really has no bearing on the
question of the existence of neutrinos.  ... one would not write a
scientific paper describing an experiment in which an experimenter
stood on a mountain and reached for the moon, and concluded that
the moon was more than eight feet from the top of the mountain."

<H1>
*** CERN to provide second DUNE cryostat
</H1> <P>
The previously agreed to build the first one and now the CERN
Council agreed to a second one.

*** DOE Budget Proposal for Fiscal Year 2022 for LBNF/DUNE & PIP-2
</H1> <P>
The House and Senate would provide the requested funding of $176 M
for DOE’s flagship Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility and DUNE
project and $90 M for the associated Proton Improvement Plan II
accelerator upgrade at Fermilab. Both proposals specify that DOE
should allocate $30 million for work at the Sanford Underground
Research Facility, where the DUNE detectors will be installed. 
Congress has not weighed in on the uncertainties currently
surrounding the project’s total cost arising partially from
shortfalls in international contributions.
