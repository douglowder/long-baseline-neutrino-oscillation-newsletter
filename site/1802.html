<H1>Long-Baseline news, February 2018 </H1>
<P> 

<H1>
*** Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) progress
</H1> <P>
The MICE experiment concluded its successful data-taking run at
the U.K.'s Rutherford Appleton Lab on Dec. 20, 2017. MICE efforts
are now focused on delivering analysis results, with the first
report of muon ionization cooling expected at IPAC18 29 April -
4 May, 2018 in Vancouver.

*** NOvA progress
</H1> <P>
It was noticed that the new NOvA results presented last month
doubled the data with 50% more beam.  NOvA is now running with
650-710 kW.  In 2018, 2.13e20pot has been delivered, with 2.09e20
pot recorded, or 98%.  A recent maintenance campaign raised the
FEB (front end board) fraction from 99.8% active to 99.97%.
When g-2 is ready for physics (not yet), the NuMI cycle time will
go from 1.33 s to 1.4 s, but FNAL is working to increase
protons per pulse to compensate.

<H1>
*** KATRIN progress
</H1> <P>
As reported in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04167"> arXiv:1802.04167 </A>,
KATRIN uses a strong gaseous molecular
tritium source and a large electrostatic spectrometer of MAC-E
filter type, is used by the KATRIN experiment with the goal of
improving the present sensitivity on the effective nu_e mass
to 0.2 eV(90% CL).  In 2016 they utilized 100 eV photoelectrons to
cover the full distance on to the main detector.  In July 2017
they used monoenergetic conversion electrons from the decay of
83Kr.  KATRIN is currently preparing for the start of a five-year
measurement phase.

<H1>
*** NuWRO progress to Version 18.02
</H1> <P>
According to Volume 18 #2 (get it?) of NuWRO news, Version 18.02
is available from NuWRO.  
<A href="http://borg.ift.uni.wroc.pl/nuwro/">
http://borg.ift.uni.wroc.pl/nuwro/
  </A>
There are new NN cross sections and reweighting tools.

*** Progress on Fermilab Accelerator Improvement Projects
</H1> <P>
An upgrade for NOvA to 900 kW is planned formerly known as PIP-1+.
It will increase proton intensity and address aging accelerator
infrastructure.  The 7 y plan includes making the target robust at
1 MW by FY19.  The initial FY18 funding from DOE doesn't include
AIPs.  Shielding assessments for the Main Injector and target
are in progress & expect approval this spring for higher ppp.

<H1>
*** Neutrino 2018 poster deadline and Neutrino summer School
</H1> <P>
The 11th International Neutrino Summer school will take place
21 May - 1 June near Mainz Germany.  
<A href="http://inss2018.uni-mainz.de/">  
http://inss2018.uni-mainz.de/
</A>
Applications are open until 15 Apr 2018.  A limited number of
scholarships are available.  Also, poster abstract submission for
Neutrino 2018, 4-9 Jun in Heidelberg, is open and ends on 1 Apr.

*** NOvA and T2K joint fits?
</H1> <P>
After a workshop to discuss joints fits, a NOvA & T2K statement:
"The NOvA and T2K Collaborations are working towards the formation
of a joint working group to enhance the measurements of neutrino
oscillation parameters made by each Collaboration individually.
The projected timescale of the NOvA-T2K working group is for
production of a full joint neutrino oscillation analysis by 2021."

<H1>
*** Double/Chooz/RENO joint fits?
</H1> <P>
There were workshops among the reactor neutrino collaborations in
Seoul in 2016 and Paris in 2017.  There might be one in 2018 in
Hong Kong.  The goal is to understand each others' analyses first
and the final goal is to combine results.

<H1>
*** Mark Your Calendar for the 10th Neutrino Day(Roman Number X)
</H1> <P>
Neutrino Day will be Saturday, July 14, 2018 in Lead, S.D.
