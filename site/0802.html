<b> Special Election Issue </b>
<P> 
<H1>
*** Neutrino Physicist elected to US Congress - Illinois 14th CD
</H1> <P>
Former Fermilab Physicist Bill Foster won a special election
caused by the resignation of former House Speaker Dennis Hastert.
Bill had designed electronics for the IMB nucleon decay
experiment which found the first evidence for the atmospheric
neutrino anomaly, before dabbling in accelerator design and now
politics.  He has to run again in November.

*** Foster to look at Fermilab Funding
</H1> <P>

"Foster said he also 
intends to ask hard questions about exactly what was done to the 
budgets of Argonne National Laboratory and Fermilab `to see if 
there is some possibility of getting those mistakes rectified.`"
Office of Science Director Orbach had told HEPAP that December's
funding cuts were not decisions of staff, but of Congressmen that
he had spoken with, and he emphasized that a compelling P5 report 
on HEP priorities was needed to turn things around.  Meanwhile
the House Science Committee says NOvA should proceed in the 
following pseudo-sentence: "The Committee also supports the High 
Energy Physics program moving forward with the planned neutrino 
experiment at Fermilab and the University of Minnesota until a 
final decision on the level of U.S. participation in the ILC is 
made."

*** Is a neutrino detector like a bridge to nowhere?
</H1> <P>
On 10 Feb, the New York Times compared the President's budget to
Earmarks, citing "$2.1M for a neutrino detector at the South Pole".

<H1>
*** Neutrino Cancer Therapy
</H1> <P>
During the primary for the 14th CD there had been a debate (which
Bill missed) and one question concerned science funding.  A
primary opponent (John Laesch) commented on how important science 
funding for Fermilab was, and used as an example that they had 
"invented neutrino cancer therapy."   Usually I wouldn't interrupt 
a debate, but I called out "neutron".  John didn't mind.

<H1>
*** Foster at the podium
</H1> <P>
When declaring victory, a candidate usually has a few politicians
with him/her.  Next to Bill Foster on Saturday night were a
senator (Dick Durbin) and a congresswoman (Jan Schakowski) and
a young-looking Nobel prize winner who had helped identify numu.

*** The Golden Years
</H1> <P>
At Neutrino '94 in Eilat Israel, the welcoming address was given
by the President of Israel, who was celebrating his 70th birthday
that week.  He asked if anyone else there was over 70, and Leon
Lederman raised his hand.  Leon happened to be giving the opening
physics address, and he started by mentioning that he was so old,
he knew the dead sea when it was only just sick.

<H1>
*** Golden Book for Project X; P5
</H1> <P>
<A href="http://www.fnal.gov/directorate/Longrange/Steering_Public/P5.html">

</A>
At a series of workshops, Fermilab prepared a Golden Book on
"Physics with a High Intensity Proton Source at FNAL" featuring
Neutrino and other physics for this new project at Fermilab.  
Whether to suggest this facility in advance of the still-highest-
priority but further-in-the-future $21.9B ILC is one of the key 
decisions before P5, which heard quite a bit about neutrinos at 
its three meetings 
<A href="http://hepwww.physics.yale.edu/P5/"> http://hepwww.physics.yale.edu/P5/.  
</A>
A neutrino
subcommittee of P5 is Peter Fisher, Bill Marciano & Stan Wojcicki.
Newsletter readers might remember that Bill Foster had resigned
from FNAL in protest of the delay of the proton driver, an early
version of Proj-X.

Neutrino Helicity is 50 years old.  The 1-day BNL Symposium on 2 
May will look back on this experiment and its impact on particle 
physics, and will highlight current worldwide activities and 
future prospects in neutrino physics.

*** Goldmine area meetings for DUSEL April 21-26 at Golden Hills
</H1> <P>
Workshops "DUSEL-Progress toward the Initial Suite of Experiments" 
will take place in Lead S.D. in the Golden Hills Resort. Physics 
is 23-26 April.

*** UK projects ranked; T2K medium-high, MINOS lower
</H1> <P>
In a programmatic review motivated by a funding crisis (see
<A href="http://www.scitech.ac.uk/STFCConsultation/comment.aspx"> 
http://www.scitech.ac.uk/STFCConsultation/comment.aspx 
</A>
and click
prioritization) Neutron EDM was among 12 "High Priority", T2K and
Super-Nemo among 19 "Medium-high", Auger and MICE exploitation
among 12 "Medium Low" and MINOS among 26 "Lower priority" items.
"As an approximate guideline, the funding that we anticipate being 
available for programs in the PPAN area could cover the High, 
Medium-High, & a significant part of the Medium-Lower categories."

<H1>
*** Canfranc Call for EOI/LOI
</H1> <P>
Researchers interested in conducting experiments in astroparticle
physics, nuclear astrophysics, underground geology and biology and
other underground sciences are encouraged to submit a request to 
the Lab Director (<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="8ee3e8effaeffdcefbe0e7f4effca0ebfd">[email&#160;protected]</a>).  Guidelines for proposals and 
LoIs to LSC can be found in "Research" 
<A href="http://www.lsc.org.es/"> http://www.lsc.org.es/ 
</A>
under "Rules for Experimental Proposals".

<H1>
*** Construction of Neutrino facility at JPARC
</H1> <P>
The Helium vessel of the Target Station (TS) was completed and 
buildings for utility (NU1, NU2) and loading (NC) are being build 
around the TS.  The 3rd horn system is being built with real 
length bus bars and support system including remote maintenance 
system for cables and pipes.  Assembly work of the Beam Dump (BD) 
for the neutrino beam line is started.  Underground wall 
construction of the Neutrino Monitor (NM) pit was completed in Dec.  
The floor construction will be finished by the end of March.
