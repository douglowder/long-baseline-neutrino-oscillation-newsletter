</p><h1>P822 Proposal</h1>
The 822 Proposal will be heard by the full PAC for
the first time at the November PAC meeting.  The revised
document is due to Fermilab by October 12th, 1993.  The
document should include answers to the questions from
the PAC and Neutrino Technical committee that were given
to us from the June 9th-10th meeting.

<h1>P822 collaboration meeting Oct 2nd in Minneapolis</h1>
The second 822 collaboration meeting will be
Saturday October 2nd at the University of Minnesota
in Minneapolis, in conjunction with the Soudan 2
meeting which is 1-4 October.  Reservations should be
made as soon as possible at the Campus Days Inn.  I will
be making up an agenda soon.  Please contact me if you
want to speak about something at the 822 meeting.

<h1>PAC REPORT</h1>
The June PAC report states,"  ...a broadly based
neutrino program will be an important and interesting
component of the physics program at the Laboratory in
the Main Injector era.  The Committee appreciates the
fact that such a program has significant risks but the
potentially large payoff in new fundamental insights is
well worth the investment...This program should include
both short baseline and long baseline experiments.  The
Committee believes that the horn-focussed neutrino beam
produced by traditional fast resonant extraction aimed
at a location far from the Fermilab site is a unique
resource."   They felt that an acceptable sensitivity
for the exclusion plot region was 10**-2 eV**2 and
10**-2 angle, and that a positive signal be convincing.

<h1>FERMILAB NEUTRINO WORKING GROUP.</h1>
The Main Injector is not being constructed at full
speed, so Fermilab is thinking about what contribution
to neutrino oscillation physics might be made before the
Main Injector is finished and ready.  This involves
studying the capabilities of producing neutrino beams
without the Main Injector and at lower energies than the
Tevatron.  The Research Division, under Gina Rameika, is
looking at the capabilities of the Main Ring, the
anti-proton beam line, and the 8 GeV Booster, for making
high luminosity neutrino beams for neutrino oscillation
experiments.  Once beam capabilities are determined,
feasible experimental programs can be judged.

<h1>Fermilab engineering for beam cost estimates.</h1>
Byron Lundberg is now running weekly meetings at
Fermilab to facilitate the beam cost estimate which is
being done.   Fermilab NUMI meetings are no longer being
held.  803 has had some group meetings at Fermilab and
822 should have some Fermilab meetings.

<h1>Proceedings of the atmospheric neutrino workshop</h1>
Proceedings of the atmospheric neutrino workshop in
Calgary are out and are  being mailed to participants.

<h1>Nestor Workshop 19-21 October in Greece</h1>
The Nestor group is the 3rd NESTOR International Workshop
in Pylos on the 19, 20, 21 of October. Pylos is a small
town on Navarino Bay, in the S.W. corner of Peloponnisos,
about 290 km from Athens. The topics:  neutrino production
mechanisms in the cosmos, neutrino astrophysics, review
of high energy cosmic rays, long baseline and atmospheric
neutrino oscillations, design characteristics and
deployment of deep water detectors and characteristics
of the NESTOR site.   Respond by E-mail to 39256::NESTOR or
to VXCERN::RESVANIS (from Leonidas K. Resvanis)

<h1>ICNAPP 2-9 Jan 1994</h1>
The International Conference on Non-Accelerator Particle
Physics will meet 2-9 January 1994 at the Indian
Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore India;  topics
include neutrino physics, neutrino astronomy and dark
matter. Respond to Ramanath Cowsik, IIA, Bangalore 560
034 India.  email to
