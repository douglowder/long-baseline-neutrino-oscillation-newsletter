<h1>Long-Baseline news,  May 2001 </h1>

<p> <h1>
*** K2K run going well
</h1>They will run to ~July 10th and should double last year's flux.
Then they plan to drain Super-Kamiokande, replace the broken
tubes and do some upgrades.  They will be able to run for some 
physics during the months when the tank is drained and refilled.

<p> <h1>
*** CERN to Frejus
</h1>Using the RF from LEP, Cern is considering a 2.2 GeV, 4MW 2mA 
Superconducting Proton Linac (SPL) which will cost about 350 MSF.
(~$200M).  Running at 75Hz, the machine will be 800 m long, and 
could aim at the Frejus tunnel 130 km away.  A physics study at 
CERN for this intense superbeam is described in 
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0105297"> hep-ph/0105297 </a>.
The low energy helps keep nu_e's from K's quite low.

<p> <h1>
*** New Frejus tunnel?
</h1>The Mont Blanc accident is motivation for Frejus to build a 2nd 
"escape" tunnel, and they might build a large underground lab at 
the same time.  The current (small) lab is 4600 mwe.  Three 
locations for a 10^6 m^3 lab have been identified.  One is 
French, one is Italian, and one is Franco-Italian.  The reduction 
in border bureaucracy has depressed the local economy and it may 
qualify for some extra funding.

<p> <h1>
*** Senators Warner and Bingaman promote DOE Science Budget
</h1>In response to the President's budget which has large (~10%) 
cuts for DOE University research, Senators John Warner (R-VA) 
and Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) are circulating a letter calling 
for increases for the DOE's Office of Science:

<p> <h1>
*** Senator Jeffords and the Law of Unintended Consequences
</h1>His break with the Bush administration was not due to policy 
differences on future neutrino experiments.  But there will be an 
effect.  One is that Senator Daschle becomes majority leader.

<p> <h1>
*** Senator Daschle promotes Homestake Underground Lab
</h1>Senator Tom Daschle (D-SD) has taken a personal interest in 
promotion of a national underground science lab at Homestake, 
as recommended by a national committee of physicists.
Operating costs that keep many miners after 1/1/2 ~$10M/year.

<p> <h1>
*** Senator Domenici promotes WIPP
</h1>Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico believes that the WIPP site 
in New Mexico is a good site.  "There is already strong
concurrence that WIPP represents a superb facility which should 
be utilized for experiments requiring its unique features-a clean, 
safe environment with a radiation background 100 times lower than 
the Homestake mine," Domenici said.

*** Congresswoman Mrs. Sonny Bono promotes San Jacinto
</h1>No, it is Mary not Cher.   The San Jacinto site is being studied 
as a horizontal access site for a national underground facility.  
The escarpment is quite steep, so a tunnel could be built to a 
very deep overburden for about $150M.  A 50m x 50m x 200 m cavern 
would be $82M.  Operating costs about $2M/year.

<p> <h1>
*** Senators UNO losers -- SNO results are soon
</h1>The former is an anagram of the latter (don't read too much into 
it.)   Long awaited SNO results are again rumored to be two weeks 
away.   But they are GUARANTEED to be released before UNO 
measures solar neutrinos in 2012.  Meanwhile, SNO has started 
adding salt to the detector, which will increase the neutral 
current cross section.

& 
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0104095"> hep-ph/0104095 </a>
are recent predictions.

<p> <h1>
*** Heaviest neutrino 2.3 eV
</h1>
Fodor et al 
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0105064"> hep-ph/0105064 </a>
assume that the highest energy cosmic 
rays come from "Z-bursts" due to extragalactic UHE neutrinos 
scattering from relic neutrinos at the Z pole.  Using maximum 
likelihood they get 2.34 +1.29 -0.84 eV.

<p> <h1>
*** Heaviest neutrino lighter than 2.2 eV
</h1>
DASI and Boomerang ignored neutrinos in their cosmological fits.
Using their data now, Wang et al fit to everything they can think 
of (including neutrinos) and set an upper limit on the 
heaviest neutrino mass at 2.2 eV.
