*** Our second Neutrino Giant award to Fred Reines
</h1> <p>
Frederick Reines was an American physicist who co-discovered the
neutrino with Cylde Cowan and won the Nobel Prize in physics in
1995. Reines sought to measure neutrino interactions as proposed
by Pauli in the Hanford and Savannah River laboratories in 1956.
Reines became the head of the Case Institute of Technology physics
department.  There, he built an experiment in South Africa which
observed atmospheric neutrinos.  As a member of IMB, he was able
to detect and study a stream of neutrinos emitted by Supernova
SN1987A. Reines grew up in North Bergun, New Jersey and had a
strong love for science as a child.  He also had a passion for
singing and later performed in the Cleveland Orchestra Chorus.

*** CD1 achieved for LBNE, 2nd stage of approval for a project
</h1> <p>
Dr. Bill Brinkman has approved Critical Decision-1 for the LBNE
Project following the 10 December meting of the Energy Systems
Acquisition Advisory Board (ESAAB).

*** The Finnish finish LAGUNA (for now)
</h1> <p>

The Finland ministries of Education and Culture, Employment and
Economy, and Transport and Communications considered whether
Finland should host the LAGUNA project, a Large Apparatus for
Grand Unification and Studying Neutrino Astrophysics.  A favored
site for this was the Pyhasalmi mine in Finland, using nus
from CERN.  The host country would be expected to contribute
20-50% of the 0.9-1.6B euro construction cost.  The Ministries
consider the LAGUNA project to be scientifically interesting,
but in view of the large costs, it is not possible for Finland
to commit to host the project.

*** Preliminary results from MINERvA shown at NuINT
</h1> <p>
There was data on inclusive charged current interactions, quasi-
elastic interactions, charged pion production and coherent and
neutral pion interactions.

The overall theme is data that helps clarify the nucleus' role
in low energy neutrino scattering, &amp; in particular how it modifies
the final state and disrupts neutrino energy reconstruction.

*** Siegrist Sermonette (to LBNE critics if there are any)
</h1> <p>
At HEPAP he said, "The HEPAP/P5 strategic plan has been
successful at:  developing a prioritized, executable program plan
that has been sufficiently flexible to respond to major changes,
conveying the interest and importance of HEP to non-HEP audiences,
framing the program in an easy-to-understand context.  And yet,
some members of the community do not seem to know what the plan
is, much less communicate it effectively to non-HEP types; worse
other members of the community will gladly substitute their own
personal vision for the community plan with little or no
prompting.  This does not convey the impression that we as a
community know what we want, which makes implementation of
anything very challenging.  It also undermines our international
standing.  For example, implementation of reconfigured LBNE seems
to suffer from this phenomenon.  This does no credit to US HEP at
an important fiscal juncture."

*** NOvA fills first modules with liquid scintillator
</h1> <p>
When completed, NOvA will be the world's largest plastic
structure.  It will be 28 "blocks" of 384 modules.  On 11 Dec,
the first two modules were filled about 236 gallons each in
3 hours.  10,750 more modules to go.  NOvA was featured in the
Economist Magazine article, "Know your neutrinos."

*** Fooling some of the people some of the time
</h1> <p>
Some notice this newsletter's style follows Park's "What's New"
newsletter on Physics &amp; Society.  He finds examples of those who
take seriously perpetual motion machines and other nonsense.  In
this vein, I have to mention Physics World listing of the top 10
physics breakthroughs of 2012 which includes MINERvA "for being
the first to demonstrate communications using nus".  In my opinion
they did no such thing.  Knowing the beam time, which had to be
communicated separately, they encoded the word neutrino in full/
empty spills.  MINOS decided not to participate in this non-study.
