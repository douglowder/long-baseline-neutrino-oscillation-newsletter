*** PIP-II Performance Baseline Approved
</h1> <p>
The performance baseline has been approved for PIP-II, the
accelerator project that will increase the beam power for the DUNE
long-baseline neutrino experiment.  The total project cost will be
$978M with CD4 scheduled for 2028.  Beam has been accelerated in
the first two PIP-II cryomodules to 17 MeV.  The mission is to
provide 1.2 MW, with a roughly 4 year ramp from CD4, and
upgradable to 2.4 MW compatible with continuous wave capability.

*** FY21 appropriations for LBNF/DUNE and PIP-II.
</h1> <p>
The budget for the flagship LBNF/DUNE project is flat at $171M,
while the associated PIP-II budget increased from $60M to $79M.
Congress also directed at least $30 million for the Sanford
Underground Research Facility in South Dakota, where DUNE will be
installed. Appropriators did not comment on the 40% increase in
the TPC for LBNF/DUNE, which stemmed from increases in civil
construction costs and shortfalls in partner contributions.

*** T2K extension approved
</h1> <p>
The proposed T2K extension, T2K-II, to accumulate POT of 20x10^21
for a 3 sigma establishment of CP violation and the precise
measurement of mixing parameters, has been officially approved at
the 30th J-PARC PAC.  Number one of Nature's ten remarkable
discoveries of 2020 was T2K's paper on CP violation in the nu
sector.

*** Roaring Neutrinos in the Roaring 20's
</h1> <p>
Due to the lack of a year zero, the decade of the 20's arguably
just started.  I make these neutrino predictions for the decade:
</p><p>
1.  We'll learn that m3 is the heaviest and that theta23 &gt; 45^o.
</p><p>
2.  Cosmological measurements of the sum of neutrino masses will
have interesting upper and non-zero lower limits.  </p><p>
3. The value of
delta_CP will not be zero or pi.  </p><p>
4.  The MiniBooNE low E excess
will be explained.  </p><p>
5. The LSND excess will not be explained. </p><p>
6. DUNE
will mostly be on time.  </p><p>
7. 0nu2beta limits will improve but there
will not be a signal. </p><p>
8. At least one of these predictions will be
wrong.  </p><p>
9.  There will be "nu" questions for the 30's.

*** Dual Phase --&gt; Vertical Drift for DUNE
</h1> <p>
The efforts within DUNE to design a dual-phase liquid Ar detector
have transitioned to the design of a single-phase vertical drift
module for the second 10 kT DUNE detector.  The September LBNC
review stated, "the viability of the (dual-phase) technology at
scale has not been demonstrated.‚Äù  A vertical drift single-phase
technology offers advantages and is being actively considered.
A consortium has been established to make a VD prototype by 2023.

*** Relic neutrinos seen from earth
</h1> <p>
There are three particles called neutrinos, nu1, nu2 and nu3.  We
live in a gravitational potential, called a galaxy, caused by dark
matter.  The nu3's are nonrelativistic, so there are more near us.
Nu3 has less nue in it, so the effective flavors locally are not
equal.  This is considered by Baushev in

Next-Generation Gamma-Ray Telescopes",  The MeV band is not well

"Studies of Low Energy Solar Neutrinos Using

"Cherenkov/scintillation separation via spectral
photon sorting with dichroicons ...",  A next-generation 50 kt
liquid scintillator detector could utilize dichroicons to improve
photodetection. Separation of long and short wavelength photons
would improve rejection of several background sources.
