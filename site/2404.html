<P>

*** ProtoDUNE NP04 argon filling started and completed
</H1> <P>

</A>
For 1 of the 2 prototype DUNE detectors, one with horizontal
drift and one with vertical drift, filling was completed 2 May.

*** Minerva spokesperson
</H1> <P>
MINERvA has elected Rik Gran from the University of Minnesota-Duluth
as its 5th co-spokesperson for the MINERvA experiment.   The
collaboration is grateful to Laura Fields from Notre Dame for her
outstanding leadership during her seven years as spokesperson.

<H1>
*** Status of JSNS2/JSNS2-II
</H1> <P>

This
collaboration searches for short-distance neutrino oscillations by
sterile neutrinos at J-PARC MLF.  For JSNS2, the 4th long physics
run was performed from Dec-2023 to Mar-2024 using a single near
detector.  7.22e21 POT were accumulated for a total of 3.95e22 POT
during 2020-2024 corresponding to 35% of approved POT (to 22 Mar
2024). This run continues to June 2024. The new far detector for
JSNS2-II is under construction. The acrylic tank was installed on
14 Feb 2024. Three quarter of the veto PMTs (36 PMTs) will be
installed, and the liquid scintillator will be filled within a few
months. JSNS2-II aims to start the data taking soon.

<H1>
*** Hyper-Kamiokande construction progress
</H1> <P>
The construction at the Kamioka mine is rapidly progressing. Last
October, the ceiling part of the cavern, 69 m diameter & 21 m high
was completed, and mining work will be completed within CY2024.
A Program Advisory Committee was organized in March.

<H1>
*** Boris Jules Kayser, 1938-2024
</H1> <P>
Boris Jules Kayser was a theoretical physicist, specializing in
the study of neutrinos. He worked at the NSF for nearly 30 years
before joining Fermilab. He retired from Fermilab in 2012. For 5
years, he was the editor of the peer-reviewed journal the Annual
Review of Nuclear and Particle Science.  He was a very commonly
used theorist for a clear talk about neutrino properties, and an
often-used fact checker for this newsletter.

<H1>
*** DESI 2024 data and neutrino mass in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03002"> arXiv:2404.03002 </A>
</H1> <P>
For the flat ΛCDM model with the sum of neutrino Sum(m_nu) free,
combining the DESI and CMB data yields an upper limit Sum(m_nu)
< 0.072 (0.113) eV at 95% CL for a Sum > 0 (Sum > 0.059) eV prior.
I don't know about you, but my prior would be > 0.059 eV.

<H1>
*** INFN school on Underground Physics (SoUP) 14-18 October
</H1> <P>
<A href="https://soup2024.ca.infn.it/ ">
https://soup2024.ca.infn.it/ 
</A>
The 3rd school will be in the
castle of Bertinoro, Italy.  SoUP is an advanced school for PhD
students, post-docs and young researchers willing to gain deeper
knowledge in topics related to underground physics.  It includes
lectures and hands-on sessions on Physics Phenomenology, Detection
Techniques & Instrumentation Technologies.  Videos of lectures
will be available on the SoUP Youtube Channel.

<H1>
*** DUNE concreting and a video on DUNE excavation
</H1> <P>
The concreting activities for the DUNE North and South Caverns are
100% and 60% complete, respectively.  The completion date for all
concrete activities is early May 2024.  See a presentation on the
"colossal caverns":

*** NuMI horn repaired
</H1> <P>
<A href="https://inside.fnal.gov/2024/04/raising-the-dead-repairing-numi-focusing-horn-ph2-02/">
https://inside.fnal.gov/2024/04/raising-the-dead-repairing-numi-focusing-horn-ph2-02/
</A>
A NuMI horn that was removed for a water leak in 2020 has been
repaired as a spare.  To minimize beam down time, the NuMI team
builds spare devices in anticipation of possible replacements. But
after there was a horn stripline crack in December 2022, there was
no horn 2 replacement readily available.
