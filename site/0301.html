*** 2002 Anno Mirabilis Neutrino
</h1>
Neutrino physicists, already with our heads in the clouds, had 
an extraordinary year in 2002.  Previously we had evidence for 
neutrino mixing in atmospheric neutrinos.  With the SNO results, 
the solar neutrino problem is no longer a problem for anyone, and 
there is clearly mixing of solar neutrinos.  With KamLAND, there 
is mixing of reactor neutrinos.  K2K has good "indications" 
for mixing of accelerator neutrinos.

*** Department of Energy Strategic Plan
</h1>
DOE Office of Science Director Ray Orbach is assembling a 20 year 
vision for DOE science with input from High Energy, Nuclear and 
Basic Energy Sciences.  HEPAP has assembled a committee to rank 
13 possible future projects.  Five of the projects are related to 
neutrinos:  3.) NuMI off-axis detector[$100-500M]; 4.) Proton 
Driver for a Neutrino Superbeam[$500M-1B]; 5) A next proton decay 
experiment[$500M-1B]; 6) Liquid Xenon double-beta decay detector 
[$100-500M] and 7) Muon Storage Ring Neutrino Factory [>$1B].  
Prices are just estimates of specified ranges for the study.

*** LMA region bifurcates
</h1>
Unless you care about history or CPT violation, you can forget 
about the SMA, LOW and Vacuum oscillation regions of parameter 
space now.  But the LMA region now has two distinct solutions 
with a 2-nu analysis, called LMA-I and LMA-II by Fogli et al.,
at dm^2 = 7.3 10^-5 eV^2, sin^2q_12 = .315; and 15.4 10^-5; .300.
In a 3-nu analysis with q_13 floating, a 3rd region, LMA-III 
appears: dm^2 ~ 2.5-3.2 10^-4 best for zero q_13.

*** KamLAND error
</h1>
By law, all Japanese reactor power levels are to be known
to 2%.  In addition, Korean reactors provide 2.5% of the event
rate and the rest of the world 0.7%.  What about geoneutrinos,
which provide signal below 2.7 MeV from Uranium and Thorium 
decays?  See Fiorentini et al, below.  

<p> <h1>
*** Indian Neutrino Observatory
</h1>
A collaboration has been formed and funded in India to study the 
possibility of a new large neutrino detector.  A first phase would 
study atmospheric neutrinos, and a second phase would hope for 
beams from elsewhere.  Two sites are under consideration, one in 
Southern India near Ooty, the Pykara Ultimate Stage Hydro 
Electric Project (PUSHEP) which is in a tunnel, and the other 
near the town of Rammam northwest of Darjeeling in the Himalayas.  
PUSHEP has better rock; at Rammam more overburden is possible.
An MOU has been signed with ~12 groups & 40 people so far.

*** Ben Franklin Award to Bahcall, Davis, Koshiba
</h1>
Just last week, an investment manager asked me "what good are 
neutrinos", and I gave the standard reply, "when Franklin was kite 
flying, he didn't know uses for electricity."  This year's Ben 
Franklin award went to John Bahcall, Raymond Davis, and Masatoshi 
Koshiba for the discovery of solar neutrinos, furthering our 
understanding of the internal processes of the Sun and stars in 
general. See

*** K2K running
</h1>
With the completion of the rebuild of Super-Kamiokande, the 
long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment K2K has resumed 
running with beam from the KEK accelerator in Tsukuba.

*** JHF/JPARC LOI for off-axis neutrino beam to Super-K
</h1>
J-PARC has received 31 Letters of Intent for Nuclear and
Particle Physics Experiments including JHF-nu.  There's also
a high-intensity mu source (PRISM) and a nu factory (NufactJ).  
A Committee to consider the LOIs will meet early spring.
The 2003 "JHF-nu" LOI is at 
<a href="http://neutrino.kek.jp/jhfnu/"> http://neutrino.kek.jp/jhfnu/

139 people from 49 institutions in 11 countries signed.

<p> <h1>
*** NuMI Off-axis workshop(s)
</h1>
A workshop to consider an off-axis experiment at Fermilab was 
held at SLAC.  The goal is to submit a proposal by October.
Several detector technologies were reviewed and a next workshop 
to narrow them down was set for April 25-27, 2003.  Some diners 
at the SLAC cafeteria wondered if NuMI off-axis meant 90 degrees,
so they could build a detector at SLAC.

<p> <h1>
*** Workshop on Radioactive Beams
</h1>
Radioactive Beams (with helium 6 and/or neon 18) making nu-e's
would be a powerful complement to superbeams(nu-mu), and may be
feasible, after some R & D to increase the neon 18 production.
A workshop on "radioactive beams for nuclear physics and neutrino 
physics" will be one of the march sessions at Moriond.  At Les 
Arcs March 17-22.  See
