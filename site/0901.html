*** Neutrino Mixing - The Leader of the PACS
</H1> <P>
When you write your paper, and it gets published, you or someone
assigns it a PACS code, for the Particle and Astronomy 
Classification Scheme.  
<A href="http://www.aip.org/pacs/"> http://www.aip.org/pacs/
</A>
Section 14 is for particles and there are 40 codes.  For the 2008
statistics of 75 journals in the SPIN database, 1460Pq Nu Mixing
was the runaway top code with 265 papers, followed by 1480Cp, non-
standard Higgs with 124 and 1420Dh proton and neutron with 79.  
Last was 1465-q Light quarks - only 3 papers.  The other neutrino 
codes are 1460Lm, Ordinary Neutrinos, which had 46 papers, and 
1460St, non-standard-model neutrinos with 57.  With apologies to 
The Shangri-Las

*** Workshop on Neutrino Technology July in Trieste
</H1> <P>
A workshop to discuss possible practical applications of
neutrinos will be held 13-17 Jul 09 at ICTP in Trieste.  It will 
consider areas of neutrino physics which can potentially lead to 
such applications. These include neutrino geophysics, Earth 
tomography, communication systems, control of atomic reactors, 
creation of new neutrino sources and detectors, use of coherent 
neutrino interactions and the neutrino Moessbauer effect.

*** Electron Neutrino Appearance in MINOS
</H1> <P>
MINOS has an electron neutrino appearance analysis group which
has been doing a blind analysis of this channel, sensitive to
theta13, for it's first 3.14 e20 protons on target.  The 
sensitivity has been shown previously.  The group will open its 
box and is tentatively scheduled to show the result at Fermilab 
late in February.  One advantage of a blind analysis is that it 
helps the group think carefully through the consistency checks 
that need to be made before looking at the result, as well as 
discouraging over-analysis after the box is open.

*** J-PARC accelerates to 30 GeV
</H1> <P>
The new Japanese main ring at Tokai has accelerated protons to
30 GeV and extracted to the abort dump, as of 23-Dec-08.  They
plan to extract to the hadron beamlines in February.  The T2K
long=baseline neutrino experiment will use this beam.

<H1>
*** NOvA and Budgets
</H1> <P>
FRA-Fermilab must become certified in Earned Value Management 
System (EVMS) budget procedures. NOvA is the first Fermilab 
project to go through this process.  There still isn't a 2009 
Federal Budget, but House stimulus bill contains extra DOE money 
for science, and if so, NOvA might be expedited.  How do I explain 
to my grand-children that NOvA was delayed, almost canceled, and 
then expedited, all for the same reason (bad US economy)?  The 
CD-2 baseline with $278M was approved.  CD-3a is approved for a 
limited $19M set of critical path/long-lead time items.  Project 
has spent $16.8M through FY08.  CD-3b Review maybe this summer.

*** References in the ArXiv, including DOE secretary Chu
</H1> <P>
Space permitting, this newsletter lists references each month,
most of which appear at 
arXiv.org, formerly known as xxx.  (It
appeared soon after www, & was the next progression in the
alphabet, but there were too many misunderstandings.)  Due to
space, in the newsletter I mail out, I just put the arXiv numbers,
but in the web version of the newsletter (always linked at
the bottom), there are full URL's so if you read mail in a web
browser, you can just click on the link.   It was interesting that
the new DOE secretary, Steven Chu, had an article appear in the
arXiv the same day as his Senate confirmation hearings.  There
were no questions at the hearings about "Noise-Immune Conjugate
Large-Area Atom Interfermoeters".

*** Five Year plan for muon collider R&D at Fermilab
</H1> <P>

There is a Neutrino Factory & Muon Collider Collaboration (NFMCC)
and Fermilab Muon Collider Task Force (MCTF) planning a possible
future neutrino program involving a neutrino factory.  In Dec 08,
they submitted a five-year R&D plan to the Department of Energy.
It includes a study to demonstrate the feasibility of building a
muon collider by 2013.  In parallel, they complete the MICE
experiment and participate in the the International Design Study
(IDS) to deliver a neutrino factory reference design report by 
2012.

*** Indian Neutrino Observatory and Elephants
</H1> <P>
The next step for the underground atmospheric neutrino experiment
in the hills of India is an environmental permit from the Tamil
Nadu state government.  Some groups have opposed this project
because trucks will go on an existing road in the habitat where 
elephants live.  The neutrino physicists themselves presumably do 
not pose a threat in this country of 1.3 billion.  According to 
an article in Science, a program to help elephants is planned.
