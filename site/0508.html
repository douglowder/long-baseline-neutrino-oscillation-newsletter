*** John Bahcall will be missed
</h1>
To many of us, John Bahcall was synonymous with solar neutrinos.
John Bahcall was one of the shapers of the neutrino paradigm that
the neutrino community is currently using.  He died at age 70.

*** NuSAG recommendations and rationale for neutrinoless double beta
</h1>
In a report released by the NSAC meeting, Neutrino Scientific
Assessment Group recommended that the US funding agencies support
the search for neutrinoless double beta decay.  They found 3
programs worthy of support.  In alphabetical order, they were CUORE,
EXO and Majorana. Lower priority for MOON and Super-NEMO.
"Neutrino-less double beta decay experiments are needed to
understand the absolute mass scale of neutrinos and to answer the
fundamental question of whether neutrinos are their own
anti-particles, that is, whether they are Majorana or Dirac
particles.  The laboratory precision beta decay experiments are
limited in sensitivity to 0.2-0.3 eV.  Neutrino-less double beta
decay experiments considered in this report may have sensitivity
to an "effective" neutrino mass an order of magnitude smaller.
Observation of neutrino-less double beta decay requires that
neutrinos are their own anti-particles, or Majorana type..."

*** Geoneutrinos, the discovery of non-cosmic rays?
</h1>
The KamLAND group has been observing neutrinos and antineutrinos
since Jan 02 with the Kamioka liquid scintillator antineutrino
detector in Japan.  Using data collected through Oct 04, KamLAND
has detected electron antineutrinos produced by the decay of 238U
and 232Th within the Earth, so-called geoneutrinos, for the first
time. The number of geoneutrinos detected is consistent with the
number predicted by a geophysical model. The radiogenic power
from the decay of 238U and 232Th is essential to understand the
dynamics, formation and evolution of the Earth. These results are
published in the 7/28 issue of Nature. &amp; see

*** Geoneutrino detector in Hawaii
</h1>
If a neutrino detector were to be built in Hawaii, where effects
of the continental crust would be negligible, it could be used to
estimate the U and Th content in the lower mantle &amp; the core. See
Enomoto et al.,

*** High Energy Neutrino Astronomy popular in India
</h1>
Despite record rains and many cancelled flights to Bombay, 700
Cosmic Ray physicists in Pune heard the latest results from Hess,
Auger, Amanda, etc.  In the neutrino sessions, there were 6 papers
on solar nus, 15 on atmospheric nus, 5 dark matter, 8 muons,
18 exotica and 53 on High Energy Neutrino Astronomy.  The
latter category featured Amanda/Ice-Cube, Antares, Auger, Baikal,
NEMO, Nestor.  Surprisingly, there were no papers about proton
decay and none about supernova neutrinos.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Antares Progress
</h1>
Antares tested "Line 0" in Spring 2005, recovering the string in
May.  There were no water leaks, but some optical transmission
issues are being studied.   The shore station is at La Seyne sur
Mer, around 20 km from the ANTARES site.  A sophisticated
timing system with a goal tzero determination better than 0.5 ns
has been developed.  Deployment is scheduled for November 2005.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Seasonal Variations in Atmospheric Neutrinos
</h1>
Cosmic Ray Muon fluxes vary seasonally by +- 2% each year as
temperature variations in the upper atmosphere cause density
variations.  Amanda has modeled and measured this effect for
atmospheric nus.  Ger-ackermann-M-abs3-he22-poster 29th ICRC.

*** NOvA needs level 3 managers
</h1>
The Fermilab NOvA project is filling out its organization to plan
his off-axis neutrino experiment in Minnesota.  Level 2 managers
so far are Stuart Mufson (scintillator), Carl Bromberg (fiber),
Rich Talaga (PVC Extrusions), Ken Heller (PVC Modules,), Leon
Mualem (DAQ), David Ayres (Assembly) and Steve Dixon (Civil)

*** Neutrino Factory Based on Linear Collider
</h1>
The idea
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/hep-ph/0507335"> (hep-ph/0507335) </a>
starts with TESLA (250 GeV &amp; 11 MW)
adds a 20 cm water target to make pions, and a 5 km decay pipe,
for a "cheaper" neutrino factory (if building a collider anyway).

*** New physics concept needs new word
</h1>
In "Covariant Extremisation of Flavour-Symmetric Jarlskog
Invariants and the Neutrino Mixing Matrix", the new word is
"Extremisation."  We would call it Extremization.

There were four references to "A4" this month and it wasn't about
