*** Super-K atmospheric neutrinos.  Minimum m up
</h2>With new data at DPF, best fits for atmospheric neutrinos are
"moving up".  The bottom delta m^2 for the allowed region at 90%
CL is now above 10^-3 eV^2.  This is good news for long-baseline
experiments.  From 736 days data, R = 1607/1502.7 / 1617/2262.6
= .67 +- .02 +- .05 for subGeV data; and 386/35.19 / 301/419.1 =
.66 +- .04 +-.08.  The best fit for numu to nutau oscillations is
1.2 to 8 10^-3 eV^2. numu to nu-sterile also fits the data
between 2 and 7 10^-3 eV^2 and numu to nue does not fit well,
chi-squared = 110/67 DoF.  They have also now added the upward
mus and upward stopping mus to the subGeV, multi-GeV and PCE
events for the numu to nutau best fit and it is stable.

*** Super-K solar neutrinos.  No solution?
</h2>With new solar data, there is no longer a good MSW fit to all of
the data at 95%CL.  The driving force for this is the energy
distribution of recoil electrons, which is suggestive of
"just-so" vacuum oscillations.  I don't think, however, that
this makes the reality of the MSW solution less likely.  It
means that as Super-Kamiokande gets more statistics, the chance
that every experiment understands its systematic errors to better
than the statistical error goes down.  Stay tuned.

*** NuMI budget request $22M next year.
</h2>The president's FY00 budget request to congress includes $22M for
line item funds for NuMI, which matches the project's funding
profile.  This is the last major increase in line-item funding for
NuMI, which was $14M in FY99 and only goes up to $23M in FY01.

*** CERN long-baseline proposals due in October 1999
</h2>Depending on whom you talk to, prospects for NGS at CERN, the
neutrino to the Gran Sasso program, are bleak or bright.  A joint
CERN/GS committee heard LOI's from seven groups in November 1998
and has set October 1999 as the date for completed proposals.

<p> </p><h2>
***  NOE prototype harvests its first data.
</h2>NOE performed a very successful test early in December at CERN of
a 6 Ton prototype.  NOE, a nutau appearance proposal for the NGS
beam, uses a low Z material (marble) to achieve high mass with a
small sampling thickness.  The conceptual design emphasizes e id
by means of TRD planes and a high resolution calorimeter (HRC).
One full module of both TRD and HRC have been tested at the PS in
December with mu, e and pi beams from 1 to 9 GeV.  Resolutions(E)
for e's; pi's are 19%/sqrt(E)+3%; 42%/sqrt(E)+3% as expected.
Further analysis, and new test beam work this year will lead to
finalization of an improved design featuring a larger active mass
and a finer sampling.

<p> </p><h2>
*** Super-(I)carus
</h2>One of the proposals being considered at CERN is for
30 kiloton Super-Icarus.  The total cost is about 100 MSWF,
including 15% contingency.  This wouldn't fit into the tunnel of
Gran Sasso, but a nearby (Castel del Monte) shallow depth (&gt;50m)
site would make it a powerful long-baseline neutrino detector.
If no CERN beam is built, such a liquid argon detector could also
be placed near Soudan.

<p> </p><h2>
*** LSND beam over.
</h2>The LSND experiment took its last beam on December 21, 1998.
They will take cosmic data for a while and then prepare tubes for
Boone.  They had ~3000 Coulombs and 39.5 +- 8.8 Decay-at-Rest
events consistent with numubar to nuebar oscillations.
Meanwhile, in running through June '98, Karmen got its first
event, in an exposure where 3.3 +-.2 background were expected.
Their limit curve and sensitivity curve are now closer.

*** Reines Seminar March 13th
</h2>Friends and colleagues of Fred Reines will hold a daylong
symposium to celebrate his life and distinguished career and
his many contributions to science. Saturday, March 13, 1999
at U.C. Irvine with an exciting program.  Space is limited to
about 200 participants, first-come, first-served.  Reserve
by sending a message to .

<p> </p><h2>
*** NuMI project manager search
</h2>The NuMI project at Fermilab has a search committee looking for a
project manager to replace Tom Fields who took the position on a
temporary basis.   The project manager will report directly to
the new Fermilab director, who I hope will be Mike Witherell.

*** Taup 99
</h2>The sixth International Workshop on "Topics in Astroparticle and
Underground Physics" - TAUP99 - to be held at College de France,
Paris, France, Sep.  6-10, 1999. see

*** A Little Mass goes a long way
</h2>"Aging particle physicists can relive the 60's without squeezing
into old bell-bottoms or blaring dusty Jimi Hendrix albums."
Thus starts a nice two-page lay article on neutrinos, SNO, long-
baseline efforts, etc. in the 30/Jan/99 issue of Science News.
But I don't know any aging particle physicists.  Do you?
