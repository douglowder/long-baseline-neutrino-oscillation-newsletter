*** Delta msquared from MINOS
</h1>
University of Minnesota physicist David Petyt presented first 
MINOS results from the NuMI beam at Fermilab last week.  MINOS 
sees a shift in the energy distribution between its near and far 
detectors.  The best fit to delta-msquared_32 is 3.05 +0.60 -0.55 
(stat) +-0.12 (syst) 10^-3 eV^2 and sin^2 2 theta = 0.88 +.12 -.15 
(stat) +- 0.06 (syst).  This is for 0.93 10^20 pot out of 1.4 to 
date.

*** Delta msquared for maximal mixing in MINOS
</h1>
If a fit is done constraining the angle to maximal mixing, the 
result is dmsq_32 = 2.70 +0.263 -0.305 10^-3 eV^2.

<p> <h1>
*** MINOS publicity
</h1>
There was quite a bit of publicity about the result confirming 
oscillations in MINOS, from Minneapolis to the BBC.  A British 
comedy group, Bremner, Bird and Fortune did a Bremner piece to 
camera, introducing a semi-surrealist monologue on (Deputy 
Prime Minister) John Prescott 
and the Big Bang

*** Doug Michael Memorial Grove
</h1>
5 trees were planted 31-Mar in honor of Doug Michael at the NuMI 
service building.  Among many other accomplishments, Doug had
worked successfully to assure that early MINOS running would 
have close to the promised proton intensity from the Main Injector.

<p> <h1>
*** New K2K result on theta-13
</h1>
sin^2 theta_mu-e < 0.13 at 90% CL.  The theta-13 limit is 0.26.

*** Adding more neutrinos to the roadmap
</h1>
The P5 committee in the U.S. is meeting to add more ambitious neutrino
objectives to the High Energy Physics Roadmap for the next 10 years.
Their charge mentions, "while all routes on the roadmap should be 
interesting, not all will be taken.  [Your] prioritization
should therefore recommend ... the relative priority
and time ordering of projects."  A meeting at Fermilab
on April 18-19 will consider neutrino and dark matter proposals.

*** NOvA mass
</h1>
The DOE has expressed a desire to keep the total cost for NOvA (EvA)
around/under $200M.  NOvA has re-optimized its baseline mass to
25 kilotons from 30 kilotons for $225M.  A detailed costing "Lehman
Review" is taking place."

<p> <h1>
*** Tritium at Fermilab
</h1>
NuMI water is safe enough to drink, but there are measurable 
levels of tritium in it.  On March 20, Fermilab received a Notice
of Violation (NOV) from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency
(IEPA).  Fermilab is maintaining a web site with information about this
at

<p> <h1>
*** Tritium at Braidwood
</h1>
The situation with some water spills at the nuclear power plant in
Braidwood has had extensive coverage in the Chicago area press for
several weeks.  There is no connection between this and the possible
neutrino experiment to measure theta13 at Braidwood.  Exelon's web site
about this is at

*** Neutrino Detection for non-proliferation
</h1>
The possibility of using neutrinos to measure Plutonium levels in 
reactors, and its connection to proposed theta-13 reactor neutrino
experiments in France and Brazil, was in the "New Scientist"

year is 42.
