Dear Colleague,
</p><p>
I'm sorry to have to inform you that Carlo Rubbia has
decided that the CERN workshop on neutrino oscillations
must be postponed in order to conform with his schedule.
We are working at rescheduling the workshop for late
January or early February (perhaps before or after
Moriond). I will let you know when we get the new date
set (hopefully very soon).
</p><p>
I am VERY sorry if this causes trouble for you due to
travel arrangements which you may have already made.
Many people are interested in the workshop and I hope
that this delay will not affect your ability to attend.
</p><p>
Regards,
</p><p>
Doug Michael

</p><h1>Approval ?</h1>
In a visit with John Peoples, Bill Reay received
agreement that consideration of the Short Baseline/Long
Baseline experiments would be given at the November 1993
PAC meeting, and that given a strong approval, stage one
approval (Approval contingent on funding) could be given
at that time.  Alternatively, the proposals could be
turned down at that time.  Given the costs, weak
approval will probably be deemed inadequate.

<h1>Extraction to Soudan.</h1>
A refined plan for extracting Main Injector beam to
Soudan is being developed by the Main Injector group.
The scheme extracts at MI62 (not MI60), gets rather deep
rather quickly, and then bends back up to get to Soudan.
This beam (*) maintains the length of the decay pipe,
(*) gets the beam down to the dolomite quickly where
groundwater radiation standards will be easier to meet,
(*) avoids horizontal bends, (*) keeps more of the
facility near existing roads and power sources, and (*)
keeps the detector building less visible from Pine
Street.

<h1>Argonne Discretionary Application</h1>
A proposal for Argonne LDRD funds to aid in the long
baseline effort was turned down for the third year in a
row.

<h1>Detector R&amp;D money </h1>
This money has been unfrozen, and efforts that were
started before are on track again, including money for
aluminum tubes at Tufts, TDC's at Minnesota.

<h1>P822 collaboration meeting</h1>
The first P822-only collaboration meeting has been
scheduled for March 22nd, 1993 at Argonne.  A Soudan 2
collaboration meeting is then scheduled for March 24-26
in Bellingham Washington.
