*** GSI timing anomaly due to neutrino oscillations?
</H1> <P>
Is there an oscillatory time modulation of the electron
capture decay of 140Pr and 142Pm?  Litvinov 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.2079"> ArXiv:0801.2079 </A>
says "Tentatively this observation is attributed to the coherent 
superposition of finite mass eigenstates of the electron 
neutrinos ..." Ivanov et al 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.2121"> ArXiv:0801.2121 </A>
says yes, and Faber
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.3262"> ArXiv:0801.3262 </A>
says "This proves that such processes provide a 
precise method to investigate neutrino--flavor mixing." But
Giunti 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.4639"> ArXiv:0801.4639 </A>
says, "It is shown that neutrino mixing
cannot explain the GSI time anomaly."  Also see

*** Good News!  The economy is bad, but...
</H1> <P>
The FY08 omnibus bill, with dire effects on NOvA, ILC and the
whole HEP field was a disaster.  There were immediately calls for
a supplemental bill to correct the problem, and the need for a
US stimulus package gave hope.  Hopes are dimming.

<H1>
*** President's budget for FY09 looks good, but...
</H1> <P>
The President's budget is usually the starting point for planning
the year which starts in October.  High Energy Physics, which fell
from $733M to $688M from 07 to 08 would be restored to $805M, and
this would fund projects key to Fermilab's future, including NOvA.

</A>
But Fermilab's Director says, "every Washington expert tells me to 
prepare for a continuing resolution that might last into the new 
administration. Such a continuing resolution would extend the 
present difficult budgets well into FY09."

<H1>
*** P5 planning for US science and the future of NOvA
</H1> <P>
At the FNAL  meeting of the new P5 panel on particle physics in
the U.S., Director Oddone laid out 5 grim scenarios for a constant
US $688M budget.  He favors one that includes NOvA in FY09.

*** Project X Workshop 2
</H1> <P>
Despite the grim present, there will be a future HEP program, and
a high intensity linac or synchrotron FNAL project may be part.
Nu talks at 
<A href="http://home.fnal.gov/~bfleming/ProjectX_Wksp_Jan25/"> 
http://home.fnal.gov/~bfleming/ProjectX_Wksp_Jan25/
</A>
A neutrino program at Fermilab was considered if Project X is
built, with 120 GeV, 1.4s rate, 1.7e14 p/spill yielding 2.3MW
and 2.4e21 protons/year based on 2e7s at full power.  A new beam
to Homestake is 5.82 degrees down and could be built for NuMI-like
cost ($120M, 6.3yr from baseline to CD4).  The NuMI decay/absorber 
meant for 0.4MW could be used for the 2MW beam because there were
redundancy and safety factors.  An operational concern is that it 
would use the redundancy/safety factor for base operations.

<H1>
*** Neutrinos at Project X - 5 kiloton (kT) Liquid Argon at Soudan
</H1> <P>
5 kT of Liquid Argon was studied with 15e20 pot each (nu & nubar)
for 4 cases:  LE-beam off-axis, ME off, LE on and ME on.  Off axis
would be at Ash River, on-axis at Soudan.  The best case is Low
Energy Wide Band On Axis Beam, with a new 5 kiloton liquid argon
detector, replacing MINOS when it is done.  There is also the
Soudan 2/CDMS hall there.

<H1>
*** Neutrinos at Project X - HiResM(nu)
</H1> <P>
This is an idea for a 7.4 ton (fiducial mass) high resolution near
detector in a magnetic field, based on the NoMAD experience and 
COMPASS design.  140 10^6 CC events in a 3 year neutrino run 
(parasitic to long-baseline) with 44 possible theses listed.

<H1>
*** Neutrinos at Project X - Water in DUSEL
</H1> <P>
The plan is to build a >300 kT fiducial volume water Cherenkov
detector 5000 ft deep.  It could be built in 100 kT chunks, and
three or more are being considered.  One plan has the first 100 kT
in FY2015, three by FY2017 for about $345M.  Work is in progress
to include the first module in the initial suite NSF project.

<H1>
*** Low Energy Neutrino Factory
</H1> <P>
Project X, upgraded to 2MW, could be the front end of a neutrino
factory project, after building a Muon Collider test facility
(target, decay channel, bunch & phase rotation, and a little bit 
of cooling).  A low energy neutrino factory (4 GeV) with a 
detector that can measure low energy muon charges has physics 
reach for both large and small theta13.

<H1>
*** NuSONG
</H1> <P>
NuSONG is a Tevatron based nu program which explores questions
that are not in the presently-proposed program.  The idea is for
a combined-beam facility providing both a sign-selected beam and
a beam dump flux, giving 20 times NuTeV's POT/year and 150 times
the total DoNuT POT.  22 thesis topics were imagined in 5 minutes.

<H1>
*** Scholastic Bowl - what was the rest of the question?
</H1> <P>
As an alumnus of my institute, I interview High School seniors
who are applying to college.  This gives me a great chance to see 
the incredible credentials of the next generation of scientists.
Sometimes the conversation turns to neutrinos.  One reported back
to me; "In my recent Scholastic Bowl Tournament, one of the 
questions began 'Which Fermion particle, until recently believed 
to be massless...'  I don't really know how the question ended 
since I buzzed in before the rest was read."
