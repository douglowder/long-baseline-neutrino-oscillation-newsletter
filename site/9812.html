<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrino is the particle of the year
</h1>Long-Baseline Neutrino News feels that the confirmation of
neutrino mass by the Super-Kamiokande collaboration justifies
considering the neutrino to be the particle of 1998.  This
story was ranked #4 for 1998 by Science Magazine.

<p> </p><h1>
*** JHF status
</h1>The JHF 50 GeV accelerator has strong new support from Monbu-sho
and Science and Technology Agency (STA) in Japan.  It will likely
be constructed at the site of Japan Atomic Energy Research
Institute (JAERI) as a cooperative project between KEK and JAERI.
Last year the project sought a supplemental JFY98 budget to get
started, but it was concluded that it was too early.  A unified
KEK/JAERI proposal for JHF plus a test experimental area for
transmutation is being written with a second stage being a higher
flux accelerator.  The present hope is to start the joint project
from JFY2000 and to have beams in 2005.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrino Fiction
</h1>Occasionally fiction makes its way into long-baseline news, such
as the October 1998 item on JHF.  This happens with rumors.
But there is real fiction:  Watching the movie "Star Trek -
Insurrection" this holiday, my movie companion asked me, "How
does a tricorder detect neutrinos?"   For Isaac Asimov fans, a
new "authorized" Foundation book, "Foundation and Chaos" by Greg
Bear, features supernova neutrinos hitting a positronic robot.

*** John Bahcall wins National Medal of Science
</h1>Established by Congress in 1959, the award is bestowed annually by
the President for outstanding contributions in the sciences.
John Bahcall, from the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton
University, was given the medal for his pioneering efforts in
neutrino astrophysics and his contributions to the development
and planning of the Hubble Space Telescope.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Ken Young Memorial Fund
</h1>We're sad to hear of the death of neutrino researcher Ken Young
from the University of Washington.  A memorial  fund at the
University of Washington will be used to encourage physics-related
topics of special interest to Ken (innovative teaching, etc.)
Send contributions to Linda Rose, box 351560, University of
Washington Dept. of Physics, Seattle WA 98195.

*** Neutrino meeting at Hopkins
</h1>The next JHU workshop will be held at Hopkins in Baltimore,
June 10-12, 1999. The title is: "Neutrinos in the Next
Millenium".  Contact .

*** Dubna. Rochester'64. Nue-numu difference just observed.
</h1>Pontecorvo: - "It is not easy to say each time 'muon neutrino',
'electron neutrino'. Maybe we can agree to use something like
'muneutrino', 'elneutrino' instead?"  Bernardini: - "Why not?
'-ino' is Italian, 'Mu' is Greek, 'el' sounds Spanish, so that
wouldn't bring neutrino out of the Mediterranean region.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Monica good for Neutrinos
</h1>Try to follow this.  Monica did her thing, and Ken Starr went
after Clinton, so Larry Flynt decided to go after Republicans.
His first victim was Speaker-designate Livingston, who resigned
leaving open the position for Dennis Hastert, the congressman who
represents Fermilab.  The same day Clinton was impeached, the
headline said Hastert's speakership will be good for Fermilab.
