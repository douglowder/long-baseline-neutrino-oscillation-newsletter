<p> </p><h1>
*** Official Opening of Sudbury Neutrino Observatory on web
</h1>The official opening of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory will
take place on April 28 and 29, 1998.  Cambridge University
Physicist Dr. Stephen Hawking will be in Sudbury for the official
opening, which will be available by webcast, starting on the 28th
at 6:30 pm  Eastern Daylight Time (UTC - 4).  See
<a href="http://sciencenorth.on.ca/sno/"> sciencenorth.on.ca/sno/ </a>
for information on the webcast.

*** Auger presented again
</h1>The scaled-back AUGER proposal was presented to the SAGENAP
panel April 14th in DC.  Some SAGENAP members were leery of
the finances and physics potential.  Overheard in the lobby,
"...the way things are going, its going to be canned."

<p> </p><h1>
*** SuperKamiokande - USA proposal
</h1>The US part of the SuperK collaboration is proposing a $1.1M
upgrade to the outer detector.  156 of 1885 tubes have died and
the loss rate is 1/8.5 days.  In mid 1999 during a drain of
Super-K there will be an opportunity to maintain the tubes.

*** New CERN numu to nue experiment - I216
</h1>This proposal to check LSND involves refurbishing the PS neutrino
beamline.  A rough cost of 3-4 MCHF is estimated.  The required
2.5 10^20 protons takes 3 of the 12 cycles of the PS for 2 years.
Information is now available under "Short Baseline" on the
<a href="http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/nu_industry.html">.NuOsc
Industry page, </a>

*** Seeing nu_taus from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN's)
</h1>VHE neutrinos produced in sources, (AGN's or gamma bursts) are
nu_e/nu_mu.  Above 1 PeV nus are absorbed by CC interactions
in the Earth.  But the Earth never becomes opaque to nu_tau since
taus produced in a CC nu_tau interaction decays back into nu_tau
before losing much energy.  This gives an experimental signature
for oscillations.   Vs. zenith angle, these Nu_tau's would be flat
up to the highest energies.  Mixing sensitivity would be dmsq &gt;
10^-17 eV^2 (for the farthest sources). This also provides the
opportunity for neutrino astronomy well beyond the PeV cutoff,
possibly out to above 10^20 eV. See Halzen/Saltzberg paper below.

<p> </p><h1>
*** All ideas for renaming the neutrino are losers
</h1>Last year, long-baseline news issued a call for renaming the
neutrinos, at the request of DOE's Peter Rosen.  Suggestions
included Microsoft, IBM and Toyota;  Father, Son, Holy Ghost;
vanilla, chocolate, strawberry.  None of these will be forwarded.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Et tu, Malcolm
</h1>At a 65th birthday party for Malcolm Derrick in Lamont Illinois,
it was noticed that three attendees were from one town in
England, (Hull) and that all three lacked Latin in their high
school career.  Should we name the neutrinos Brian Musgrave, Don
Perkins and Malcolm Derrick?  Malcolm started his career by
writing an award winning essay at Birmingham University on
Neutrinos.  Referring to early neutrino experiments, Don Perkins
pointed out that almost anything you did was interesting, but
that most of what you did turned out to be wrong.

They account for the solar and
atmo nu problems by introducing maximal mixing between
conventional and sterile neutrino partners.  Using an extended
seesaw mechanism they introduce a new U(1) global symmetry
together with an extended Higgs sector.
