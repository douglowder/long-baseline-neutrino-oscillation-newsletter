*** Sanford Underground Research Facility selected historic site
</h1> <p>
The APS added SURF to its list of historic sites for Ray Davis'
work on solar neutrinos.  From 1962 to 1994, he built and operated
the first successful detector for solar neutrinos using John N.
Bahcall’s theoretical model and working with William A. Fowler,
Maurice Goldhaber, and numerous engineers and crew members on the
4850 Level of the Homestake Mine.  That location is now the Davis
Campus at the Sanford Underground Research Facility.

*** Super-Kamiokande expands fiducial volume
</h1> <p>
For two nucleon decay modes, Super-K increased the mass that was
analyzed 22.5 to 27.2 kton, with a small increase in potential
background.  This could help other analyses.

*** Panofsky award to Sobel and Kearns
</h1> <p>
Henry Sobel at UC Irvine and Edward Kearns at Boston University
were awarded the 2021 Panofsky Prize in Experimental Particle
Physics. "For pioneering and leadership contributions to large
underground experiments for the discovery of neutrino oscillations
and sensitive searches for baryon number violation."

*** Moore award to Strigari and Martoff
</h1> <p>
Louis Strigari from Texas A&amp;M and C. Jeff Martoff from Temple
University were recipients of the Gordon &amp; Betty Moore Foundation
Fundamental Physics Innovation Awards for their neutrino work.

*** neutrino road
</h1> <p>
In July 1962, L. Lederman et al. published in PRL "Observation
of High-Energy Neutrino Reactions and the Existence of Two Kinds
of Neutrinos", showing their understanding of hyphens and showing
the existence of the muon neutrino.  On 7 Oct. 2020, the Chicago
City Council passed ordinance S02020-107 authorizing and directing
the Commissioner of Transportation to take the actions necessary
to honorarily designate 33rd Street from State Street to LaSalle
Street as, "Leon Lederman Way" where it crosses the IIT campus.

*** old neutrinos
</h1> <p>
While we expect 330 neutrinos per cubic centimeter of the universe
left over from the big bang, there should be a smaller number of
supernova relic neutrinos from the O(10^18) supernovae that have
gone off in the visible universe to date.  The current background
dominated limit from Super-K is about twice the most optimistic
expected flux.  By tagging neutrons, Super-K Gd and Hyper-K Gd
should be able to greatly improve that search.  See:

"The ESS neutrino Super Beam Design Study ESSnuSB
and the High-Intensity Frontier Initiative HIFI"
With a 400 m circumference accumulator ring to compress the
duration of each ESS pulse, it proposes that an intense neutrino
superbeam could be utilized to improve systematic error in
measuring CP violation with a detector at the 2nd oscillation max.

It proposes a water-based liquid scintillator detector at SURF
able to simultaneously detect scintillation light and Cherenkov
light.  It could be the 4th detector at DUNE.

"Far-Future COHERENT physics program at the SNS"
COHERENT plans to have further high-statistics configurations.
Recently, they had success with their first 2 CEvNS measurements
with CsI and Ar.  They plan to add detectors within the
Second Trial Station (STS) at the SNS.

"Nu Scattering Measurements on H &amp; Deuterium"
It proposes a 1 ton hydrogen and/or deuterium based detector
focusing on measuring neutrino-nucleon amplitudes to be built at
DUNE.  It would be a secondary target to search for new physics.
Several ideas for experimental configurations are discussed.

Pure Water at SNO+"  Using the impressive efficiency of SNO+ to
detect neutrons, it can measure three Canadian nuclear reactors'
operations through identification of inverse beta decay at this
water Cherenkov detector currently running.  ~6 IBDs per year.
