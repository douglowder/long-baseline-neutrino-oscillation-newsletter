*** Critical Decision Zero (CD0) for LBNE
</H1> <P>
The idea for a long-baseline neutrino experiment from Fermilab to 
the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Lab (DUSEL) got CD0 
from the U.S. DOE in Jan 2010.  CD0 is also known as Mission Need.  
The project includes a new beamline pointed at South Dakota and a 
detector at Homestake/DUSEL.  It is currently called LBNE and has 
a web page at 
<A href="http://lbne.fnal.gov/"> http://lbne.fnal.gov/.  </A>
It does not include 
accelerator upgrades beyond those for NOvA, such as Project X.

For comparison, here is NOvA CD schedule:  CD0 in Nov 2005; CD1 in 
May 2007; CD2 in September 2008; CD3a in Oct 2008; CD3b - Oct 2009.

*** Critical Decisions One and Two for MicroBooNe
</H1> <P>
With a total project cost of <$19M, MicroBooNe, a joint NSF/DOE
project,  will be a 100 ton liquid argon detector in the Booster 
neutrino beam.  Their CD1 review is in March and CD2 goal late 
this year.  The MicroBooNE detector serves as a necessary next 
step in a phased program towards the construction of massive, 
kilo-ton range, LArTPC detectors.  The goal of the R&D program is 
the construction of 20-kton detector for the Long-Baseline 
Neutrino Experiment, LBNE.

*** LBNE Project Management Team
</H1> <P>
Jim Strait from Fermilab has been appointed as Project Manager
for the Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE).  Regina Rameika
from Fermilab will be Project Scientist.  The project manager for 
the new neutrino beamline is Vaia Papadimitrou from Fermilab. 
There will be a near detector, and two far detector technologies 
are being considered, and the project managers are Chris Mauger
from Los Alamos (near), Bruce Baller from Fermilab (liquid Argon)
and Jim Stewart from Brookhaven (water).

*** There is a hyphen in long-baseline neutrinos
</H1> <P>
<A href="index.html"> Long-baseline neutrino news </A>
has come out since 1992.  Some
experiments, such as CHOOZ, K2K, MINOS and OPERA have been done 
with a long baseline.  They are long-baseline neutrino experiments,
with a hyphen, because the baseline is long, and not the neutrino
or the experiment.  The hyphen never caught on in High Energy 
Physics.  "Most high energy physicists are tall or stoned."

*** Neutrinos in Europe; CNGS; OPERA
</H1> <P>
During the 2009 CNGS run 3.5E19 protons on target were delivered 
(to be compared with the 1.7E19 pot collected in 2008). This 
corresponds to 3692 neutrino interactions in the the OPERA 
emulsion target.  The Collaboration has started a systematic 
decay search on located events. 

<H1>
*** Neutrinos in Europe; CNGS; ICARUS
</H1> <P>
This is a 600 ton liquid argon neutrino detector at Gran Sasso
in the CNGS beam.   There are two 300-ton modules in a cryostat
of which one had been operated previously at Pavia.  It is now
being vacuum checked at 10^-4 torr, and will be cooled down
10 Feb.  Filling is scheduled to start 26 Feb and go through 
10 Mar.  Thousands of CNGS beam events could start in April. 

<H1>
*** MINERvA at Fermilab finishes construction
</H1> <P>
MINERvA completed its detector construction in January, and as a 
result has started installation of the last 40% of its detector 
modules underground in the NuMI Beamline.  MINERvA has been 
collecting anti-neutrino data since early November when the first 
60% of the detector was installed, and will continue to take data 
while the upstream portion of the detector is added.  Detector 
installation is expected to be complete in March.

*** ND280 for T2K closes its magnet; Neutrinos set to music 
</H1> <P>
See the magnet close at

& view events taken by the ND280 off-axis detector, which is not in 
physics run yet, but taking data as appropriate when commissioning 
of beam runs occur.

*** Y2KX problem
</H1> <P>
The date on the newsletter is always the previous month.  I've 
thought the date should correspond to the "news" if possible.  A
few years ago, I moved my target date a few days later to match
a Spires compendium that a colleague sends me monthly.  The last
issue was much later yet.  While I should think of a clever 
computer bug to blame, it probably wasn't my computer's fault.

*** Neutrinos and Life
</H1> <P>
My new word is enantiomerism.  While not in my dictionary, I found 
it online in a medical dictionary, and it means the relationship
between two stereoisomers having molecules that are mirror images 
of each other.  A possible explanation for the imbalance between 
left-handed and right-handed amino acids on the earth and in the 
cosmos is given in "Supernovae and the Chirality of the Amino 
Acids" by Boyd, Kajino and Onaka 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.3849"> arXiv:1001.3849.  </A>
This idea 
involves the spin of 14N in the precursor molecules from which 
amino acids might be formed, and the nus together with the B field 
selectively destroying one orientation of 14N.  Go Double Helix!
