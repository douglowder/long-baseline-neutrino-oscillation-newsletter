Long-Baseline news, March 2003</h1>

<h1>
*** P5 panel hears about NuMI</h1>
Mike Witherell showed the following quote form the 12/11/02 NuMI review
to P5 (reviewing other new ideas); "The project's current forecast for
DOE Level 0 milestone CD-4 (Begin Operations) is January 19, 2005, which
would leave 254 days of float until the baseline date of September 30,
2005. The committee commended the project for accomplishing all DOE milestones
since the last review (2 for civil and 1 form NuMI) well ahead of the baseline
schedule. The Committee is concerned about delays in completing the design
of critical technical components. No funding issues"
<h1>
*** High Energy Physics 20 year neutrino Roadmap</h1>
A HEPAP panel (some call it P5++) provided input to the Orbach planning
process with a comparison of 13 projects, 5 of which are neutrino-related.
Those 5 are described in this table:

*** One year of Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay</h1>
In <a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0302248">hep-ph/0302248 </a>&amp;
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0302237">hep-ph/0302237,
</a>H.V.
Klapdor-Kleingrothaus says that evidence for 0nu beta-beta decay of 76Ge
reported in late 01 by Heidelberg-Moscow (still operating) which uses 11
kg of 86% enriched 76Ge detectors, and is the most sensitive such experiment
worldwide, was indirectly supported recently by analysis of an earlier
experiment using natural Germanium detectors. The 16 events observed in
the Heidelberg-Moscow experiment, from which a 1/2-life of 1.5x10**25 years
was deduced at 95% CL, correspond to an expectation of 0.6 events in the
California experiment by David Caldwell and colleagues. While in the latter
the same background lines were found in the vicinity of the double beta
signal, no indication of a double beta signal, which should show up as
a line at 2039.006 keV, was found, consistent with the Heidelberg-Moscow
result.

*** Neutrinos for Peace</h1>
A futuristic idea on using neutrinos to disable nuclear weapons has been
circulated as a draft paper before the authors were ready to go public.
Expect to hear more about this idea later.
<h1>
*** Neutrino source at Palo Verde reportedly threatened</h1>
Media Reports last week identified the Palo Verde Nuclear Power Plant in
Arizona as a possible future target of terrorists. At the request of Arizona
Governor Janet Napolitano, an unspecified number of national guardsmen
were sent to protect the reactor. The plant was the site of a previous
nu experiment under 32 MWE overburden. <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/specials/special12/articles/0321war-paloverde21.html">http://www.azcentral.com/specials/special12/articles/0321war-paloverde21.html</a>

*** Pontecorvo and nuclear reactors in Russia</h1>
Pontecorvo may be best known for his prediction in 1958 that neutrinos
would oscillate if they had mass, and that those oscillations would be
characterized by a mixing matrix. He also suggested that neutrinos were
detectable from both reactors and the sun. When he suggested to Fermi that
they try to see nus from the sun, "he (Fermi) understood that it was a
long range project, so why waste time with that?" Pontecorvo also did precise
tritium and muon beta decay experiments, and determined that the muon must
decay to an electron and two undetected particles. Pontecorvo's politics
and the times he lived in shaped his career. Because he kept his involvement
with the French Communist party a secret from Harwell, he was unhappy there,
even before they discovered the truth. During the Korean war, Pontecorvo
emigrated to the USSR, since he "did not want to be in the west when World
War III broke out". Unfortunately, once in the USSR he was not allowed
to do experiments near reactors, because it was thought he might be a spy
from the West.

*** Neutrinos seek shelter on Shelter Island; 27May-4June</h1>
A Summer School is being organized to introduce researchers and students
to both the particle and accelerator physics aspects of a Neutrino Factory
on Shelter Island in New York. It is in conjunction with NuFact03, at Columbia
NYC, June 5-11,2003.

*** SNIT 2003 - CKM &amp; MNS; Summer Institute in Canada</h1>
The 15th annual Summer Nuclear Institute at TRIUMF (Vancouver) will be
21 July to 1 Aug 03. This year's topic is "CKM and MNS: Quark and Lepton
Mixings". The institute provides short courses in subatomic physics at
the graduate student level. It's for both experimental and theoretical
physics students.

*** Nestor's First Floor</h1>
Nestor's 1st floor (twelve-15" tubes) of a tower was successfully deployed
at the deep-sea site (4000 m) in the Ionian Sea. The floor is connected
to the shore station in Methoni by a 28 km cable. Control and read-out
systems have been checked out and seem to be operating correctly. Rates
~0.5 Hz are consistent with expectations at the present trigger settings.
The program of calibration and evaluation of the detector has now started.
