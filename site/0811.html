*** First SciBooNE paper submitted; Coherent pi production
</h1>
The SciBooNE Collaboration has performed a search for charged
current coherent pion production from muon neutrinos scattering on
Carbon, \nu_\mu ^{12}C \to \mu^- ^{12}C \pi^+, with two distinct
data samples. No evidence for coherent pion production is observed.
They set 90% confidence level upper limits on the cross section
ratio of charged current coherent pion production to the total
charged current cross section at 0.67\times 10^{-2} at mean
neutrino energy 1.1 GeV and 1.36\times 10^{-2} at mean neutrino
energy 2.2 GeV.

*** 2009 HEP budget briefing mixes bad vibes and good news

"Looking ahead to the
completion of the FY 2009 funding bill, Kovar said projections
show that the "impacts are really significant" if Congress were to
continue FY 2008 funding through September 2009.  DOE estimates a
reduction-in-force of 175 to 200 employees at the labs, operation
of the Tevatron would be terminated at the end of six months, and
the NOvA project canceled.  Recent indications from Capitol Hill
point to a satisfactory outcome for the FY 2009."  In
<a href="http://www.aip.org/fyi/2008/110.html"> http://www.aip.org/fyi/2008/110.html
</a>, a
senate bill added $175M to the DOE for "science".

*** NOvA receives Stage 2 approval at Fermilab
</h1>
Now that NOvA has CD-3a approval from the DOE, FNAL director
Oddone has granted Stage II approval for the experiment.  This
may reflect optimism that Congress may pass a budget for HEP in
2008-2009 beyond the continuing resolution.

*** GSI electron capture and neutrino oscillations (?)
</h1>
A lively session at the 2008 International Conference on Particles
and Nuclei was devoted to electron capture results which some
interpret as neutrino oscillations.  Kienle showed data from GSI
on decays from 140Pr, 142Pr and new preliminary data from 122I
which periodicity.  Stuart Freedman reported on a "Search for
Oscillation of the Electron-Capture Decay Probability of 142Pm
using the Berkeley Gas Filled Separator" which did not see
periodicity.  The discussion covered phases, coherence, hyperfine
splitting, the uncertainty principle, and the attitudes of particle
&amp; nuclear physicists. Also see 0811.1765

*** Antares back to life after a cable incident
</h1>
Antares was off for 2.5 months due to a problem with their
cable.
<a href="http://antares.in2p3.fr/News/index.html"> http://antares.in2p3.fr/News/index.html
</a>
23 km into their
their 40 km cable, a defect was found and fixed, as can be seen
here:

*** Double Chooz veto tank installed
</h1>
A steel vessel which will hold the inner veto for the Double
Chooz experiment has been installed in the Chooz pit and is being
welded.  In order to position it after welding, it is currently
sitting on a couple meters of water, like a boat.  It will be
sandblasted with 7 tons of sand.

</p><h1>
*** Cute kid tests bucket for neutrino experiment
</h1>
Double Chooz ordered 803 ten inch PMTs which have arrived (in
Germany and Japan), been tested and cleaned and are ready to send
to Chooz. They will be installed by lowering them in a bucket into
the tank before the acrylic vessels are installed.  The bucket has
been purchased and tested by a cute kid. The tubes have also been
tested and cleaned, with only a small handful not meeting specs.

*** OPERA ends 2008 run
</h1>
The CNGS for the OPERA neutrino oscillation experiment ended 3 Nov
(so that the LHC could fix itself), after starting 18 Jun.  They
recorded 10100 on-time events, &amp; 1700 candidate interactions in
the emulsion target.  This corresponds to almost 1 tau expected.
In the sample of events located, they have 2 charm candidates with
an expectation ~2.  The 2009 CNGS run aims to at least double the
integrated intensity (1.7e19 pot) and get the 1st tau candidate.

*** Champagne Neutrino Workshop 19-21 October 2009

What goes better together than Champagne and neutrinos?  The dates
and wine for this French workshop are fixed - other details later.

*** SHINE hadroproduction experiment for T2K
</h1>
Neutrinos in beams mostly come from pi decay and the pi mesons
are created when protons hit targets.  Thus to know your neutrino
beam, you need to know hadron production rates.  The HARP
experiment at CERN helped tune the K2K Monte Carlo, the MIPP
experiment at Fermilab is useful for MINOS.  At CERN, the NA61
SHINE experiment is an experiment at the CERN-SPS to measure
pi and K hadroproduction cross sections to characterize T2K.
A pilot run was taken in 2007 and 50 days of beam were planned for
2008, but the LHC incident caused SPS extraction to the North
Area to be stopped on very short notice.  Commissioning of new
systems was almost completed, but no physics run was taken.  They
hope to recover the the lost beam time in 2009.
