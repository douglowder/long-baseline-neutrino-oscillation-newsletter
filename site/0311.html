*** Fermilab Off-Axis progress
</h1>
A status report on progress towards an off-axis neutrino
experiment at Fermilab (P929) was recently submitted for the PAC.

The presentation is scheduled for 2:15 pm, December 12.

*** Icicle Creek in Washington is NUSEL candidate
</h1>
A Washington State Geologist and experts at the geotechnical firm
Shannon and Wilson were asked to assess geotechnical suitability
of 12 western sites.  Two sites on Icicle Creek, under Cashmere &amp;
Cannon Mts., were outstanding candidates. The former, farther from
the Leavenworth fault and somewhat deeper, with a strong bridge
and an existing access road, became the top choice. There is the
possibility of great cover 7400'; uniform, highly competent rock;
and the existence of 2 long tunnels. The utility tunnel for the 8-
mile New Cascade Tunnel is unlined, allowing an opportunity
to assess the geology and hydrology. Other advantages include
low-cost power and good visitor accommodations nearby.

*** Majorana White Paper
</h1>
The Majorana Collaboration has produced a white paper about their
Zero NuDouble-Beta Decay Experiment.  The objective is to study
neutrinoless 2-beta decay with an effective mass sensitivity
&lt;50 meV to characterize the Majorana nature, the mass spectrum,
and the absolute mass scale.  It will consist of a large mass of
76Ge in the form of high-resolution intrinsic germanium detectors
located deep underground within a low-background shielding
environment.  Observation of a sharp peak at the endpoint is the
signal.  In addition to a modest R&amp;D program, they show the scope,
the low level of technical risk, and their readiness.

*** Art McDonald wins Herzberg Medal
</h1>
Arthur McDonald was named winner of the 2003 Gerhard Herzberg
Canada Gold Medal for Science and Engineering.  He will receive
$1 million in research funding from the Natural Sciences and
Engineering Research Council (NSERC).  "Dr. McDonald was the
driving force for the Sudbury Neutrino Project, which has been
such an outstanding international scientific success story and
a source of great pride for all Canadians," said Ottawa-Vanier
M.P. Mauril Bï¿½langer, who announced the award on behalf of Allan
Rock, Minister of Industry and Dr. Rey Pagtakhan, Secretary of
State.

*** MICE (Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment) Approved at RAL
</h1>
The goal is to realize ionization cooling in practice by showing
they can design, engineer, build and measure in a beam a cooling
channel capable of giving the desired performance for a neutrino
factory.

Bob Seger, recently inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,
is putting out a new CD with a song called "Tomorrow".  On NPR he
said "...it uses analogies from science which I think if you talk
to a physicist are already passe, but basically the message is
to appreciate what you have today because no-one knows what's
happening tomorrow"  The song goes: 'Let me see a show of hands,
tell me the truth now.  What happens if neutrinos have mass?
I can't tell you about tomorrow.  I'm in love since yesterday.
In between your joy and sorrow, I suggest you have your say.'

*** Neutrino Religion
</h1>
We get letters: "You are doing neutrino-religion, not science. To
really do serious science, the APS should study ALL alternative
theories on the various neutrino conjectures, including the proof
by X that the neutrino hypotheses are not needed whenever you
consider hadrons as they are in the physical reality, extended,
for the extremely trivial reasons that, in the real world (that
outside the politics on Einstein) angular momentum can transform
into linear momentum and vice versa.  But of course the APS cannot
do that because of the usual academic dirt controlling the $$$ ..."
