*** Homestake pumping water
</h1>
The Barrick Corporation, which owns the Homestake mine, announced
its intention to turn off the pumps.  Al Mann and Ken Lande flew
to Lead to protest and the mayor obtained a restraining order
from the state's 4th judicial circuit court to keep the pumps
running.  The NUSEL-Homestake Executive committee pointed out
that flooding of the 8000 ft level will irreversibly damage plans
for a geomicrobiology program.  SD Governor Rounds got Barrick to
agree pumping into June.  The NSF site selection will occur soon.

*** NuMI not always pumping water
</h1>
The civil construction of the NuMI tunnels is done, but all of
the infrastructure, such as backup pumps have not yet been
installed.  So far, there have been a few floods, up to 8 inches,
as the one set of pumps have not always worked.  No damage done.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Flamanville could pump water again
</h1>
One possible source for a reactor neutrino theta13 experiment is a
8.3 Gwth (total) reactor complex at Flamanville near La Manche.
Its the site of a previous iron mine with levels at 90m and 150m
under the reactor, great potential locations for a near detector.
Maps are needed to determine if an appropriate far detector site
can be found.  The mine had been drained and filled 10 times.  It
was most recently drained after World War II but has been full of
water for 40 years.  It could be drained in 8 days.

*** K2K-II Water Detector Rededicated with Dr. John Marburger
</h1>
In April, K2K was rededicated as K2K-II at a ceremony held at KEK
after successful rebuild of its far detector Super-Kamiokande.
Leading the American delegation was Dr. John Marburger, Director
of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and science advisor
to President Bush.  He also toured the K2K beamline and near
detector along with other facilities at KEK, where Y. Totsuka,
leader of the original Super-Kamiokande project, assumed the
position of Director General in April.

*** Boundary Waters
</h1>
The NuMI off-axis experiment could use a detector in Northern
Minnesota (~700 km) or in Southern Canada (~960km).  A possible
site for the latter is in Kenora; for the former at LTV.  The
distance can effect the amount of matter effects.   As the
proposal is being written, more than one site for the detector
will be considered.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Salty Water
</h1>
SNO has provided two measurements of the neutral current rate of
solar neutrinos and they will soon provide a third.  They have
recently shown data of the energy spectrum and isotropy since
they have added the salt.  A blindness parameter has been added.
The distributions look as expected.

*** More Water - UNO proton decay experiment
</h1>
The P5++ panel wrote that the physics of a next generation
nucleon decay experiment in the US is "absolutely central"
The UNO collaboration is formalizing itself in order to move
forward with a design and proposal and choosing a site.

*** TESCOE - where bargains are found for off-axis detector
</h1>
A committee has been established to consider the detector
technology choices for a NuMI off-axis experiment.  Options being
considered include liquid and solid scintillator and resistive
plate chambers.  There is also a cost committee, Costco, to go
along with Tescoe (a word that's the UK version of Walmart).

*** Using Reactors to measure theta13, an amazing thing happens.
</h1>
The best limit on th_13 comes from a reactor experiment (Chooz).
No such experiment is currently running because they are limited
by systematic errors.  Two detector experiments are being
considered to limit systematic errors.
In <a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0303232"> hep-ph/0303232 </a>
Huber et al. show
that high luminosity experiments (&gt;1000 ton-Gigawatt-years)
return to statistical improvement in theta_13 sensitivity when
the statistical error on the flux at the far detector measures
the flux better than the external input! sin^2 2q &lt;0.005 possible.

*** The moment of conception and neutrinos
</h1>
About two hundred neutrino physicists received an email idea from
a New Jersey attorney that the moment of conception for humans
might be related to solar neutrinos.  Several answered him
pointing out some of the flaws in this idea.

<p> </p><h1>
*** LVD as part of CNGS
</h1>
Rock muons from CNGS into the LVD experiment may be a useful beam
monitor according to Aglietta et al., in
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0304018"> hep-ex/0304018.  </a>
150
