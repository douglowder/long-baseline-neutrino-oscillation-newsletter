*** Hyper-Kamiokande to start construction in 2020
</H1> <P>
On 12 Sep 2018, during the Hyper-Kamiokande general meeting at IPMU
(Kashiwa, U.Tokyo), Professor T. Kajita, Director of the Institute
for Cosmic Ray Research at the University of Tokyo and 2015 Nobel
Laureate in Physics, on behalf of the University of Tokyo,
announced the start of construction of the experiment in 2020.
The proto-collaboration that is currently writing the Technical
Report for the far detector to finalize its design, as well as
working on the high power beam and near detector configuration,
was excited by this ground-breaking news and welcomes more
international partners.

*** European Neutrino meeting 22-24 Oct at CERN
</H1> <P>
<A href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/740296/">

Panels on oscillations
(convener P. Huber), Beyond PMNS (O. Fischer), Nus & the Universe
(M. Shoposhnikov) and Ancillary measurements (F. Sanchez) are
getting ready.  This is related to the update of the European
Strategy for Particle Physics, a 2-year process aiming at
developing a common vision for the future of particle physics in
Europe. The process is expected to be concluded in May 2020.
To inform this process, written input is invited 18 Dec 2018.

*** INO progress
</H1> <P>
In a step forward, the National Green Trust upheld environmental
clearance for the India-Based Neutrino Observatory in South India.
The next step is approval from the National Board of Wildlife.

*** Neutrino replaces Higgs as #1 in Review of Particle Physics
</H1> <P>
Order RPP @ 
<A href="http://pdg.lbl.gov/2018/html/receive_our_products.html">  
http://pdg.lbl.gov/2018/html/receive_our_products.html
</A>
or you can download individual reviews and print them yourself.
All 127 reviews from 2016 were downloaded more than 1000 times.
The top one was "Neutrino Mass, Mixing and Oscillations" by Petcov
and Nakamura with ~69,000 downloads.  In the 2014 edition, Higgs
Boson Physics was downloaded the most.  There is a new review on
Neutrinos and Cosmology in 2018.

<H1>
*** theta23 values in PDG
</H1> <P>
In the 2018 edition, the PDG quotes 4 values of sin^2(q23),
depending on the mass order and angle octant.  For normal order NO
Octant 2 is is 0.597 +0.024 -0.030; and 0.417 for NO,O1;
0.592 for IO,O2, 0.421 for IO,O1.  See pdgLive

<H1>
*** New PDG listings for double beta decay
</H1> <P>
Previously, results from two neutrino double beta decay and
neutrinoless double beta decay were listed together.  For 2018,
2nu-betabeta lifetimes are in 1 node, 0nu-betabeta limits another.

<H1>
*** Leon Lederman 1922-2018
</H1> <P>
We all mourn the passing of Leon Lederman, former FNAL Director &
leader of the Prize winning team that distinguished nue and numu.

*** New release of Genie 3.0.0 Neutrino generator
</H1> <P>
This is a major release designed to help the users to select the
best configuration for their analysis purposes.  The main
difference, from the user point of view, is the concept of tune,
which is a set of consistent models and parameters.  With v3 the
collaboration will support numerous tunes out of the box, whose
brief description can be found at

*** Using geoneutrinos to search for "second continents"
</H1> <P>
So-called second continents are upper crustal materials subducted
below 300 km and gravitationally stabilized near 650 km depth.
Seismological techniques can't image them.  But Roskovec et al.
show in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10914"> arXiv:1810.10914 </A>
"Testing a proposed 2nd continent under
Eastern China using geoneutrinos" that land and ocean-based geonu
detectors deployed at strategic locations could find Australia
sized 2nd continents and test models of mantle/plate dynamics.
