*** Progress regarding neutrino mass limits from cosmology
</H1> <P>
According to 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14524"> arXiv:2411.14524, </A>
 "As cosmological datasets grow, the
nu mass will soon be either measured or a bound in clear conflict
with oscillation experiments will be placed." That paper separates
2 cosmological nu mass effects:  background evolution related to
the neutrino energy density, & kinematic perturbations related to
nu free-streaming.  Limits Sum(m) < 50 meV is the strongest limit
compared to Sum > 60 meV from oscillations.  A new DESI limit in
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12022"> arXiv:2411.12022 </A>
 gives Sum(m) < 71 meV at 95%CL, which disagrees
with the inverted mass order.  
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06000"> arXiv:2411.06000 </A>
uses SPT-3G
polarization data to conclude Sum(m) < 75 meV.  Stay tuned.

*** 53 layoffs at Fermilab
</H1> <P>
There has been a lot of coverage lately about Lab management, with
new structures for ANL and FNAL.  I'm used to ANL being "managed"
by the U of Chicago, and FNAL by URA, but IMO these were small
supportive offices with the real work done by the directorate
and oversight came from the DOE.  "Fermi Forward", a new entity
for FNAL seems larger, which I imagine is not a good thing.  It is
probably unrelated, but a rare round of FNAL layoffs took place
following a work pause which was advertised to try to avoid them.

*** US election effect on particle physics
</H1> <P>
The new Senate Majority Leader is South Dakota Senator John Thune
who helped promote the development of Homestake to Sanford Lab.

From AIP's fyi: "Project 2025, led by the Heritage Foundation, is
widely seen as a blueprint for the incoming administration.
Project 2025 looks to focus the DOE on fundamental research that
the private sector would not otherwise conduct, arguing that many
current DOE programs `act as subsidies to the private sector for
government-favored resources.' The DOE chapter is authored by
Bernard McNamee, who worked in the department during the 1st Trump
administration...(He) proposes that DOE prioritize and consolidate
its programs based on factors such as ... scientific discovery."

*** CEvNS - Standard meme for Coherent Neutrino Scattering
</H1> <P>
In the literature, CNS, CNNS and CENNS can be found.  The "E" is
for elastic, which is valuable since otherwise it can and does get
confused with coherent pi production at GeV energies, a totally
different process.  The pair NN reminds many nuclear physicists of
nucleon-nucleon scattering.   CE$\nu$ENS works in word but in a
plain text environment is just plain ugly. So the community has
settled on "CEvNS", pronounced "sevens".  Spread the meme!

He introduced
nucleon correlations to neutrino physicists, all after he retired
in 2001.  When you hear someone say the words 2p2h or MEC as if
these are household names, smile and think of Gerry Garvey. It was
a long road of understanding to thankfully get to where we are now
and Gerry was right at the front showing the way.  He connected
the keywords and showed that the enhancement of nu cross sections
around 1 GeV is real. He noticed the enhancement due to np-nh in
the Martini model (2010)

although he regretted dismissing the idea at first.

*** Preparation for 2024-26 European Particle Strategy Update
</H1> <P>
In 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04175"> arXiv:2411.04175 </A>
 a description of opportunities at a Forward
Physics Facility are outlined.  The science case involves Dark
Matter, new particles, neutrino physics, QCD and astroparticle
physics. The document covers the site, cost, schedule, new
experiments and facility considerations.

*** How to cite Geant4
</H1> <P>
The proper way to cite Geant4 papers can be found under this link:
<A href="https://geant4.web.cern.ch/#please-make-sure-to-cite-the-following-papers-if-you-use-geant4">
https://geant4.web.cern.ch/#please-make-sure-to-cite-the-following-papers-if-you-use-geant4
</A>
Citing all the (currently 3) papers is important, as each version
of Geant4 is built upon the experience and the code based upon the
previous versions and all authors should be credited.  1) Recent
Developments in Geant4, J. Allison et al., Nucl. Instrum. Meth.
A835 (2016) 186-225;  2) Geant4 Developments and Applications, J.
Allison et al., IEEE Trans. Nucl. Sci. 53 (2006) 270-278;
3) Geant4 - A Simulation Toolkit, S. Agostinelli et al., Nucl.
Instrum. Meth. A 506 (2003) 250-303;

One of the 1st 2 cospokespersons of DUNE, he has had a career in
both neutrino physics and (what I call) non-nu particle physics,
i.e. the rest of it.  He also has a popular book that covers both:
