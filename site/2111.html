*** NOvA and T2K working on a joint fit
</H1> <P>
The NOvA and T2K collaborations have formed a working group to prepare a joint fit of NOvA and T2K data for neutrino oscillation parameters in the 3-nu paradigm.  The analysis breaks degeneracies between oscillation parameters due to different baselines and energies of the two individual experiments. The combined result will exploit the full sensitivity of the experiments using correct statistical treatment.

*** NSAC considers neutrinoless double beta decay
</H1> <P>
At the 16 Nov. 2021 NSAC meeting, Tim Hallman, Associate Director
Office of Science, reported on the progress and prospects for ton-
scale neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. He wrote:
"Despite all our earnest efforts and total technical success there
is a substantial chance after 20 years and $1.0 B in investment
that we will only observe background down to the limit of 10^28 y.
That puts a big premium on being able to verify any claimed
signal at that limit.  A serious campaign would benefit from
having >1 ton-scale experiment & different systematics, especially
given the uncertainty in the nuclear matrix elements.

*** Status of the LEGEND proposal
</H1> <P>
This high-purity Ge crystal experiment will build on developments
by GERDA, MAJORANA, and LEGEND-200.  It will have low backgrounds,
excellent resolution, and topology discrimination to allow for an
unambiguous discovery of 0νββdecay at 3 sigma of 1.60 e28 y , and
12 meV for median mbetabeta.  The DOE cost is $257M including 56%
contingency.  International collaborators contribute 40%.

<H1>
*** Status of the nEXO proposal
</H1> <P>
Scaling of a Liquid Xe Time Projection Chamber is favorable for
background reduction.  Radon mitigation is understood and the
relevant radon background components do not have a spatial
distribution like the signal.  The DOE TPC is $350M out of $406M
total.  The 3-sigma discovery for the half-life is 1.35 e28y and
11 meV for mbetabeta.

<H1>
*** Status of the CUPID proposal
</H1> <P>
This scintillating crystal bolometer will be sensitive to a
lifetime of e27 years at 3 sigma and  m2beta at 15 meV.  The DOE
TPC is $35M out of $64M and will be at LNGS in Italy.

*** Lilienfeld prize to Stony brook's Chang Kee Jung
</H1> <P>
He is recognized for his outstanding contributions and leadership
in experimental neutrino physics and outstanding teaching and
outreach, especially on the physics of sports.

*** MicroBooNE turned off
</H1> <P>
Following a successful year-long R&D run and after collecting 
~0.5M neutrino interactions in argon, MicroBooNE has put the 
detector in dormant mode after completing data taking on 25 Oct.

 "Improving Large LArTPC Performance Through the Use
of Photo-Ionizing Dopants", Anti-correlation between the energy
deposited in scintillation and ionization leads to an energy
smearing without the accurate utilization of both signals.
Dopants will help deal with this, but always more R&D is needed.
