<p> </p><h1>
*** Joint CERN-Gran Sasso Long-Baseline Meeting
</h1>The scientific committees of the SPS at CERN and of the Gran
Sasso laboratories will meet at CERN on 3-4 November to have a
discussion of Neutrinos to Gran Sasso.  They have called for
ideas of experiments with this beam by documents up to 10 pages
due October 10th.  They have requested that documents for
experiments with or without a near station show their exclusion
curves as well as 4-sigma discovery curves, based on shared beam,
3 10^19 protons per year and 3 year runs.  High and Low energy
fluxes will be released by the end of September.

<p> </p><h1>
*** NOMAD finishes
</h1>NOMAD, the short baseline neutrino experiment at CERN, ended
their run on September 19th.  This year there were 1.8 E+19
protons on the neutrino target.  Some of the time, the beam was
set for antineutrinos rather than the neutrinos NOMAD (and
CHORUS) usually ran.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Jurassic Pair
</h1>A proposal is being written to move NOMAD and a version of
CHORUS together to the JURA mountains, where the present CERN
neutrino beam already goes.  It might be called JEDDO (Jura
Experiment Dual Detector Oscillation) and would be sensitive to
numu to nutau oscillations in the LSND region.

<p> </p><h1>
*** How many long-baseline beams should there be?
</h1>Some participants at the European neutrino oscillation Workshop
NOW98 felt that there should be one high-energy long-baseline
neutrino beam, NGS or NuMI, and not both.  But this was the
minority view.  The complementarity of the two beams was
discussed in a Nature article dated September 10, 1998.  One
scenario discussed in Amsterdam was that each program spend its
first year confirming that oscillations exist, and then the two
programs can split the tasks that will take long runs.  One
could use a narrow band beam to pin down oscillation parameters,
while the other runs with antineutrinos to look for CP effects.

*** Best quote at NOW98: Bilenky
</h1>"Phenomenology can be done by theorists interested in experiment
and by experimentalists who are interested in theory.  Theory can
only be done by theorists who are not interested in experiment."

*** Neutrino Telescopes 8th Workshop 23-26 February
</h1>A wide range of subjects in neutrino physics and astrophysics
will be covered by this workshop in Venice.  Contact

*** Secretary of Energy Richardson finishes Main Injector
</h1>Richardson tightened the last four bolts on the final 20-ton
dipole magnet installed in Fermilab's Main Injector on September
24th.  Richardson said, "Fermilab's new Main Injector will open up
extraordinary new opportunities for discovery in this basic field
of research, not only for scientists from the United States but
for the international physics community."  Beam soon!

<p> </p><h1>
*** NuMI second in Future ER Facility Needs
</h1>In a 7 page September report from Director of Energy Research
Martha Krebs, "Future Science Facility Needs,"  the "near term"
HEP list was LHC, NuMI, BTeV and Non-Accelerator Facilities.
The long-term wish list were new colliders;  ee, VLHC and mumu.
These were "large facilities (&gt;$25 -$50 million) most needed
by the scientific communities which look to the Office of
Energy Research for sponsorship."

<p> </p><h1>
*** Palo Verde has data
</h1>The Palo Verde reactor neutrino oscillation experiment has gotten
their first data, 19.6 days from July/August 1998.  Results soon.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Another LSND "signal"
</h1>There is a report that LSND has a new analysis from DIF neutrinos
of numu to nue oscillations.  The look for Nue 12C to
e- N12(groundstate) which decays to e+,nu,12C with a 15 MeV
endpoint.  This is the same oscillation signature that Karmen
doesn't see.  There is a correlated e+ and e- double tag within
30 cm and 5 milliseconds and a reported signal of 5 with 0.5
expected background.

spectrum distortion,

They stress here that a
distortion of the spectrum at high energies is expected if the 8B
abundance in the Sun is less than the standard prediction due to
the the emerging role of the hep neutrinos.

muon neutrino zenith angle distribution with new interactions but
without oscillations.

The new principle
minimizes the effect on the CL's when less background is observed
than expected.
