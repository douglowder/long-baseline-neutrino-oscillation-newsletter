<p> </p><h1>
*** K2K resumes running
</h1>K2K data taking started again on 30 October at 01:00 am JST,
right on schedule.  Initial conditions were:  Horn current 250
kA, proton intensity was 5 10^12 ppp.   In previous running they
have one fidvol event, expecting about 5.5 (no oscillations).

<p> </p><h1>
*** Fermilab rejects Emulsion R&amp;D proposal
</h1>The PAC and Fermilab Director are not convinced that the emulsion
method would lead to a compelling experiment.  "The case for
hybrid emulsion R&amp;D is not strong enough to justify the
investment of already-scarce Laboratory resources."

<p> </p><h1>
*** PPARC approves MINOS
</h1> UK participation/funding for MINOS was approved enthusiastically.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Aspen summer neutrino meeting
</h1>A workshop titled "NEUTRINOS WITH MASS, THE NEW PARADIGM IN
PHYSICS AND ASTROPHYSICS" will be held at Aspen 6/26-7/17/00.
In addition to updated results from many reactor, accelerator and
underground experiments, there will be new experimental results
from K2K, SNO, and SuperK.  There are other experiments in
preparation such as GALLEX, KamLAND, MINOS, and detectors in Gran
Sasso which we hope will produce results in the next few years.
Future new projects could test theoretical predictions from
different scenarios.  Email  or

*** MINOS blaster likes work
</h1>The MINOS cavity blasting has finished the entrance tunnel and
is ramping up to the ceiling of the MINOS cavity.  A front page
article about the blasting in the Tower "Timberjay" reports
that "Logistics, unique rules make work complicated for MINOS
cavern contractor".  It wasn't clear if one of the unique rules
was conservation of lepton number.   22,000 cubic yards of
greenstone are to be removed, under a $5.1 Million contract.
A jumbo driller makes 110 holes for each blast in two shifts.

*** Interest growing in sub-dominant numu to nue
</h1>The numu to nutau explanation of the Super-K results implies that
numu to nue should be seen with the same delta m-squared, but
with strength proportional to MNS matrix element U_e3.  Chooz
limits this to under 5%.  There is potential for confusion
because the relevant parameter differs by a factor of 2 from the
usual two-component mixing angle expression.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Week in Warrenville?
</h1>A congressionally mandated 40% travel cutback affects DOE supported
National Labs, including Fermilab.  This makes the annual
off-site meeting at Soudan difficult.  The annual week-in-the-
woods may need to be replaced with a Fermi area summer meeting.

<p> </p><h1>
*** How confident are you in YOUR confidence levels?
</h1>A workshop on confidence limits is to be held at CERN on 17-18
November 2000.

If you wish to attend there is a required reading list!

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrino ponderomotive force
</h1>Neutrino oscillations in dense matter produce collective forces,
which are maximal for resonant conversion in the adiabatic
region.  See Grasso, below

<p> </p><h1>
*** Should the km^3 detector be put on Uranus?
</h1>Escribano et al. (below) consider the possibility of neutrino
lensing by astrophysical objects. Nus can cross a star's core
which results in better focalization.  The Earth-sun distance is
too small for a sizable effect to take place, but a neutrino
telescope on Uranus would notice the enhancement of distant
neutrino sources whenever they are aligned with the sun.

*** Please update your email address
</h1>Every month, I get back dozens of email messages from automatic
mail handlers.  Please check that the email address this is sent
to is your preferred (and most stable) email address.  Thanks.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Toolkit for studying 3 generation neutrino mixing
</h1>Adam Para developed a kit to investigate the effects of 3 family
oscillation. It uses the oldest version of java he could find.
It's a new item which can be found on the nu oscillation industry
page:
