*** Borexino sees pep solar neutrinos
</H1> <P>
They measured the rate of pep solar nus to be 3.13 +- 0.55(stat)
+- 0.23 (syst) per day per 100ton and constrained CNO nus to <7.6
at 95%CL.  They can reject the dominant background in the 1-2 MeV
region which is cosmogenic 11C.  Assuming the LMA, this is
a solar nu flux 1.6+-0.3 x 108 cm^-2s^-1 and < 7.4 (95%CL) in
agreement with SSM.  These represent the first measurement of pep
nus and the strongest constraint of the CNO solar nu flux to date.

*** Neutrino Physicists celebrate the end of the Tevatron 30 Sep
</H1> <P>
The Tevatron turned off to a big party, even as the NuMI run 
continues.  Neutrino physicists will get more protons.  In 
particular, the ANU project will use the recycler to raise the 
power from about 250 kW to 700 kW for NuMI.  The short term gain 
for NuMI may be only 6%, due to shortening the cycle from 2.2 s to 
2.06 s.  The long shutdown is scheduled for Mar 5, 2012 but there 
are rumors for extensions to May or June.  Read or share Tevatron
memories in the 
guest book:

*** MINOS ends Antineutrino run 15 Sep
</H1> <P>
A new target (NT07) was installed in the NuMI beam, and the 
priority was switched from MINOS to Minerva on 15 Sep, which 
resulted in a switch from focusing for antinus to focusing nus.  

<H1>
*** Hyper-Kamiokande Letter of Intent
</H1> <P>
A description of a possible 0.99 million metric ton water
Cherenkov detector (0.56 fiducial) is on the 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.3262"> arXiv:1109.3262.
</A>
It would be 8 km south of Super-K, 295 km from J-PARC, and 
use 99,000 20-inch PMTs.  A neutrino physics program to study
theta-13, mass hierarchy, CP violation, along with nucleon
decay, supernova burst neutrinos, supernova relic neutrinos,
dark matter searches and solar flare neutrinos is described.

*** Senate appropriations bill and LBNE
</H1> <P>
"The Committee provides no construction funds for the Long-Baseline 
Neutrino Experiment. The Committee is concerned that this project 
is not mature enough for construction because a location for this 
experiment in an underground laboratory has not yet been selected 
and the decision of the National Science Foundation to discontinue 
construction funding for the Deep Underground Science and Engineering 
Laboratory in South Dakota has created uncertainty about the future 
of the project. In addition, the Office of Science has not yet 
selected a technology, which affects where the experiment can be 
located and total cost."

*** Intensity Workshop 30 Nov-2 Dec; Neutrino premeeting 24 Oct.

*** A bit more on statistics
</H1> <P>
<A href="http://www.neutrinooscillation.org/statistics.html"> 
http://www.neutrinooscillation.org/statistics.html </A>
- Last month's 
made-up statistics debate generated the most feedback, almost all 
positive (surprisingly to me), in the history of this newsletter,
e.g. "Karana wins, hands down!"  But I must conclude that the 
statistics of those who chose to reply was not unbiased.  Many 
disagree, e.g. those who want to drop 90% CL curves for higher CL.

*** Superluminal neutrinos - What OPERA saw
</H1> <P>
They measure position with geodesy, time with good clocks, and fit 
the shape of the 10 microsecond proton pulse with a fast BCT in the 
SPS with the shape of the neutrino pulse in the Gran Sasso.  Nus  
appear 60.7+-6.9 +-7.4  ns early.  (v-c)/c = 2.48+-0.28+-0.30 e-5.

</A>

<H1>
*** Superluminal neutrinos - What MINOS saw
</H1> <P>
With geodesy and a not-so-good clock, MINOS in 2007 fit the shape 
of the nu pulse in the near and far detectors (v-c)/c=5.1+-2.7e-5.  
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0437"> arXiv:0706.0437.  </A>
A task force is looking into new clocks, etc.

<H1>
*** Superluminal neutrinos - When people looked at Wikipedia
</H1> <P>
I once saw a Monte Carlo study that, if within a group of 
people, everyone repeated a rumor until they hit someone that
had heard it, about 28% of the group would hear it.   The 
announcement was 23 Sep.  I heard it on 15 Sep.  Maybe
it started 12 Sep?

*** Superluminal neutrinos - What we'll learn
</H1> <P>
I first learned about neutrino oscillations from a Robert Shrock
lecture after there was a rumor that an experiment at SIN had 
observed muons decaying to e-gamma.  I don't know if the data was 
ever published.  Over the next weeks, we'll certainly learn about 
the accuracy of GPS clocks including GR effects, time-dependent 
ripple in kicker magnets, subtleties of the differences between 
group velocity versus phase velocity, Gauss-Boaga surveying,...
