<H1>Long-Baseline news, January 2025 </H1> <P>

*** Fermilab summer shutdown
</H1> <P>
The temperature 2 weeks ago in International Falls Minnesota, near
the location of the NOvA far detector, reached -35 degrees F.

</A>
(Just a reminder that at -40, the Fahrenheit and Centigrade scales
unify.)  The 2024 summer shutdown of the NuMI beam at Fermilab is
continuing.  However, NOvA is seeing some off-axis events in the
Booster Neutrino Beam.

<H1>
*** New Fermilab Director
</H1> <P>
Young Kee Kim has replaced Lia Merminga but most of you knew that.


<H1>
*** S8
</H1> <P>
Several papers this month use nus to address the quantity S8,
which is used to quantify the amplitude of matter density fluctu-
ations in the universe.  L. Zu et al. in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13785"> arXiv:2501.13785 </A>
 "Can
nu-DM interactions solve the S8 discrepancy?"; P. Shah et al. in
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19117"> arXiv:2501.19117 </A>
"It's not sigma8: constraining the non-linear
matter power spectrum with the Dark Energy Survey Year-5 supernova
sample"; and M. Yarahmadi and A. Salehi in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07860"> arXiv:2501.07860  </A>
 "Using
the Kaniadakis horizon entropy in the presence of neutrinos to
alleviate the Hubble and S8 Tensions".  One more is 2501.06611.  

<H1>
*** Coherent neutrino scattering using Germanium
</H1> <P>
The CONUS+ collaboration has reported their first observation of
coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS). It uses
reactor electron antineutrinos and Ge detectors with recoil
thresholds as low as 160 eVee. 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05206"> arXiv:2501.05206. </A>
  See
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17843"> arXiv:2501.17843 </A>
 "Implications of the first CONUS+ measurement
of coherent elastic nu-nucleus scattering".  Also see A. Chattaraj
et al. in "Probing Standard Model and Beyond with Reactor CEνNS
Data of CONUS+ experiment" and M. Alpizar-Vernegas et al in
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10355"> arXiv:2501.10355, </A>
"Exploring the Standard Model and Beyond from
the Evidence of CEνNS with Reactor Antineutrinos in CONUS+".

*** Web page rules at ANL may change
</H1> <P>
The long-baseline neutrino newsletter has been available from the
web page 
<A href="">
</A>
https://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/longbnews/ since near the 1st
issue in 1992.  A strange byproduct of the new president in DC may
be that rules change and affect the newsletter.  We'll see.

<H1>
*** T2K operation status
</H1> <P>
T2K resumed operation in neutrino mode at the end of November.
From mid-December, operations were switched to anti-neutrino mode,
and stable operation is being conducted at 810 kW. The ND system
at 280 m downstream of the target, which was upgraded with a new 
Super-FGD, High-AngleTPC and Time-Of-Flight detector, is running.

<H1>
*** JSNS2-II
</H1> <P>
The JSNS2/JSNS2-II collaboration searches for neutrino oscillation
with a short distance by sterile neutrinos at J-PARC MLF.    For
JSNS2, the 5th long physics run using one ND is being prepared.
For JSNS2-II, the new far detector is under its calibration phase.
The gains and timing responses of 172 PMTs located in the inner
stainless-steel tank was calibrated in-situ using the fast-timing
LED system installed in the detector. JSNS2-II aims to start the
commissioning data taking with beam soon, in parallel with the
next physics run of the near detector. 

<H1>
*** Could neutrinos have long-range interactions?
</H1> <P>
A plethora of long-range neutrino interactions will be probed by
DUNE and T2HK.  See 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14835"> arXiv:2501.14835. </A>

<H1>
*** Neutrino Platform at CERN work temporarily halted
</H1> <P>
An oxygen deficiency hazard safety incident occurred at CERN
in Geneva, Switzerland, in Building 182, which focuses on neutrino
platform activities. Two members of the CERN personnel lost
consciousness 17 Jan. while working in a confined space used to
contain Ar.
