*** DUNE/LBNF gets CD1R and passes review toward CD3a
</h1> <p>
Following the successful CD-1R review in July, DOE Under Secretary
Orr formally approved LBNF/DUNE CD-1R.  And in December, LBNF/DUNE
achieved another major milestone with the successful completion of
a DOE Independent Project Review. The purpose was to assess the
readiness to begin early construction at the far site.  Initial
construction work needs to begin in FY17. This includes expanding
the existing drifts, constructing systems to move the rock
to the surface and completing other work necessary for the major
excavation operations planned to start in FY18.  That excavation
work will move 800,000 tons of rock to create the underground
laboratory space needed for the 40-kton fiducial volume DUNE.

*** LBNF construction included in U.S. 2016 budget
</h1> <p>
A U.S. Budget "compromise" passed Congress in late December.  It
includes $26M for construction of the Long-Baseline Neutrino
Facility at Fermilab.  See page 34 (located on page 73 of the PDF
file) at

*** NOvA - The name of the year for 2015
</h1> <p>
If you put Nova into the Social Security Administration's website
for popular baby names, in 2011, it was the 888th most popular.
In 2014, it rose to 287.

*** The neutrino mass crash of 2015
</h1> <p>
Cosmological measurements are sensitive to nu properties.  Some
physicists ignore them, as they did the solar neutrino problem.
Francesco Vissani has developed a Linked-In page tracking this:

The assumptions need to be fully understood, but taking the
results at face value, the hierarchy is normal.

*** Christmas presents from MINERvA
</h1> <p>
In a December presentation at the Fermilab Wine &amp; Cheese, MINERvA
presented a calculation of the NuMI Flux.  Also

*** Neutrino 2015 and Neutrino 2016
</h1> <p>
There was no Nu conference this year, but it was a great year
with the Breakthrough Prize for neutrinos as well as Nobel prizes
to Kajita and McDonald.  Expect them to be speakers at Neutrino
2016 in London.

including a Neutrino Detector R&amp;D Workshop 20-21 Jan at Fermilab.

*** DUNE CDR reference now available in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06148"> arXiv:1512.06148 </a>
</h1> <p>
The best reference for DUNE is the Conceptual Design Report,
previously available from web pages (not ideal for a reference).
Now Volume 2, The Physics Program for DUNE and LBNF is available.

*** Short-Baseline Neutrino Program Progress Review
</h1> <p>
There was a Dec. Director's Progress Review of SBN covering cost,
schedule, management, ES&amp;H and technical aspects.  The committee
commended the team "for the good progress made so far, and looks
forward to a successful completion of the construction and a
successful scientific program that it will enable."  The schedule
goal of completing SBND ready for cold commissioning by July
2018 and delivery of ICARUS to Fermilab is expected early 2017.

*** Open Access to journals reporting on neutrinos
</h1> <p>
The Long-Baseline Neutrino Newsletter has long been available to
anyone at no cost.  New rules require HEP publications, including
those on neutrinos, to be "open access"; whatever that really
means.  Here are rules for CERN-Oct 14, NSF-Jan 16, DOE-Oct 15:

*** Presidential candidate might block nu oscillations
</h1> <p>
Waving a report from the TeV muon collider study that muon
neutrino radiation could be lethal, one of the presidential
candidates proposed banning all muon neutrinos from entering the
borders of the United States.  "We have to protect the homeland"
the candidate stated during a rally in Iowa.  When questioned
about how to prevent muon neutrinos from going through the
borders, the reply was "I'll put up a wall.  If it has to be light
years of lead, so be it."  When asked by a reporter at a stop in
New Hampshire how to deal with the fact that electron and tau
neutrinos have been oscillating into muon neutrinos, the answer
was that when president, "...that will have to stop, drastic
times call for drastic measures."
