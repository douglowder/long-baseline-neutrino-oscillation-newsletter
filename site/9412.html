*** Long Baseline Week January 9-13th at Fermilab.
</h1> <p>
The Fermilab Long Baseline Collaboration will meet January 9th-13th
at Fermilab with the main goal of working on and writing the proposal
for the experiment to the Fermilab PAC.  To make input to the
agenda, contact Stan Wojcicki at smtp%"".

*** Long Baseline Collaboration Meetings; Reference Detector
</h1> <p>
At the December Long Baseline collaboration meeting, a reference detector was
specified for the purpose of costing and physics results in the proposal.
The reference detector is as follows:  8 kt iron plus 3.85 kt concrete,
or about 12 kt total mass.  The concrete is 8m x 8m square with 5 cm thick
plates and a 2cm gap for 480 layers of detector.  The steel is 8m wide
octagons with a .3m diameter hole.  Layers are 4cm thick with 2cm gap for
480 layers of detector (960 layers total).  The concrete section is 28.8m
long and the steel 33.6 m long for 62.4m.  Active elements will be
limited streamer tubes with 2cm (x8m) strips.  Soudan 2 will sit where it is,
and the near detector will have both concrete and steel sections, but the size
has been under further discussion.

*** KEK Long baseline plans
</h1> <p>
At the 2nd KEK workshop, there was a strong consensus that a Long Baseline
Experiment is one of the most important things that the KEK PS can do.  They
need to do a number of things to get ready, most of them requiring about 3
years, thus sometime in 1998 they might start running.  The PS has 5 x 10^12
ppp.  If they get all the beam and the cycle time is 2 s, they can get 10^20
protons in 2 years, which would yield 400 events in Super-K.  About 1/3rd
of the steel plate liner is installed, with PM's due next spring.

*** Gallex reports source experiment--They get what's expected.
</h1> <p>
The Gallex collaboration has announced the result of a test of their neutrino
experiment using a 51-Cr neutrino source on their 71-Ge production rate.
They report 1.04 +- 0.12 for R=Q-measured/Q-calculated.  After 20 years of
solar neutrino observations, it's a relief that one of them has been
calibrated with a neutrino source.  It is noted below
that this result can place a limit on nu-e disappearance above 0.2 eV^2.

*** Fermilab Long Baseline Naming Committee
</h1> <p>
Doug Michael and Maury Goodman are accepting name ideas for the Fermilab Long
Baseline Experiment.  The winning entry will receive a bottle of good wine.
The name will be on the agenda of the Institutional Board the 2nd week of
January.  Ideas which have NOT been submitted to the name committee include:
Soudan 3; MINE-BATS (Main Injector Neutrino Experiment-Built At Tower Soudan);
BATSEX (BATavia to Soudan EXperiment) and LOON (LOngbaseline Oscillating
Neutrinos).

*** Hepap Subpanel
</h1> <p>
Hepap has a meeting at Cornell in mid-May, so the hope is that the
Subpanel on long baseline would have a recommendation by then.  Tom
Romanowski at the DOE office has been made the secretary of the Subpanel and
is soliciting names for inclusion.

*** Neutrons suggested as solution to atmospheric anomaly
</h1> <p>
Is the apparent numu to nue ratio due to pizeros created by neutrons from
cosmic muons which create hadronic showers in the rock?  This is the
suggestion of a new preprint by Ryazhskaya.  She argues that R increases with
depth in the data, charged pi's undergo nuclear interactions and fall below
Cerenkov threshold, and that veto counters don't veto neutrons.
Arguments against this idea include different depth and rate dependences at
IMB and Kamiokande, the fact that veto counters should also veto the muon that
goes along with the neutron, and zenith angle and distance to the wall
distributions look like isotropic neutrino induced distributions and not
downward going neutron induced distributions.

</p><p> </p><h1>
*** Upward going muon calculations need to consider low energy cross sections.
</h1> <p>
Do the upward going muon and stopping muon rates limit neutrino oscillations?
Even if one believes the Volkova flux, the answer may be no, according to
a new paper by Lipari, Lusignoli and Sartogo.  They point out that that the
lowest multiplicity exclusive channels are an important part of the neutrino
cross section, and they do not scale with energy in the same way as deep
inelastic scattering.  They calculate a 10% lower value of stopping muons to
throughgoing muons than used in the IMB limit based on this test.  The
statistical error is 12%, so the limit would be reduced.  Together with the
potential for background in the upward going stopping events, there is no limit
at all left at 90% CL.

*** DOE cutbacks and Long Baseline
</h1> <p>
Recently it has begun to look like all four long baseline projects will
proceed (Fermilab, Brookhaven, KEK, CERN).  On December 19th, it was announced
that the Department of Energy would get some rather large cuts (subject to
Congressional approval).  $10B in 5 years.   DOE has a total budget (95) of
$18.5 billion.  Even if HEP is not affected directly, we will be indirectly.
ANL-HEP had a hard time getting discretionary funds this year due to funding
cutbacks in nuclear energy research.
