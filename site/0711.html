*** NuMI restarted
</h1> <p>
MINOS is again taking data after a slightly extended shutdown.
Work included repair of a water pipe section for horn #2.

*** Cooperative Agreement between DOE & U of M for NOvA lab
</h1> <p>
The Department of Energy Office of Science has awarded a $45M, 
4-year cooperative agreement to the University of Minnesota's 
School of Physics and Astronomy to build a new physics laboratory 
near the Ash River, about 60 km SE of International Falls, Minn.

*** Minerva CD stuff
</h1> <p>
On November 8, 2007, Dennis Kovar approved MINERvA to begin 
construction as soon as funds are available.  This approval 
(affectionately referred to as "CD-3") means that the design and 
engineering are essentially complete, and a final design review 
has been performed.  CD-3a (approval for a limited number of items) 
was granted Mar 07 and the full CD-3 ("CD-3b") in November.  The 
DOE has requested funding for construction of MINERvA in its FY08 
budget request.  MINERvA plans to go full speed ahead as soon as 
the Continuing Resolution is over.  MINERvA will measure nu
interactions in unprecedented detail on a variety of nuclear 
targets, which, while being interesting in its own right, is also 
a key ingredient in long-baseline oscillation experiments.

*** Helmut Faissner, 1928-2007
</h1> <p>
Helmut Faissner, a pioneer of neutrino experiments at CERN died
in August of this year.  He conducted the first neutrino 
experiments at CERN in 1963, separating electron and muon nus.  He 
played a key role in identifying neutral currents at Gargammelle.

<H1>
*** Three mixing angles
</h1> <p>
There are 3 mixing angles in the MNS matrix, and these are 
commonly known as (q for theta) q12, q23 and q13.  These numbers 
are labels, they could have been called anything, and the order of
the pair is of no consequence.

<H1>
*** Three neutrino mass names
</h1> <p>
The mass eigenstates have to be defined in some way. This is 
similar to naming the electron, muon and tau.  For neutrinos, we 
define the eigenstates 1,2,3, with masses m1, m2, m3 such that:
a) m1 < m2.
b) if the mass hierarchy is normal, m3 > m2,m1, 
c) if the mass hierarchy is inverted, m3 < m2,m1, 

<H1>
*** Why isn't m3 the heaviest?
</h1> <p>
We could define the states such that m3 > m2 > m1. In this case, 
however, the relation between mixing angles and the different 
oscillation "channels" would be hierarchy dependent. For the 
normal hierarchy, the "solar" angle is q12, the "atmospheric" 
angle is q23, and the "CHOOZ" angle is q13 as usual.  On the other 
hand, if the hierarchy were inverted, we would need to relabel the 
mixing angles. If one sticks to the PDG angle parameterization:
a) tan qsolar = sin q13 / (sin q12 * cos q13)
b) sin qchooz = cos q12 * cos q13
c) tan qatm = something very messy -- a horrible choice

<H1>
*** 6 mass squared differences - sign matters
</h1> <p>
With 3 masses, there are 6 (ordered) differences of the squares of 
the masses(dmsq).  Order matters, e.g. dmsq13 = - dmsq31.  3 are 
the negative of the other 3, and each 3 sum to zero, so only 2 are 
independent.  The PDG uses dmsq21 and dmsq32.  At the moment, we 
know the sign of dmsq21 (positive) but not dmsq32.  dmsq32 and
dmsq31 are different, but it will be some time before they can be 
measured separately.

<H1>
*** Neutrino Sudoku
</h1> <p>
With 3 neutrino mass eigenstates, 3 neutrino flavor eigenstates,
and 3 intermediate vector bosons, we can create neutrino sudoku.

*** Sakurai prize for Mikheyev and Smirnov
</h1> <p>
A. Smirnov & S. Mikheyev have been awarded the 2008 Sakurai prize
by the APS "for pioneering and influential work on the enhancement 
of neutrino oscillations in matter, which is essential to a 
quantitative understanding of the solar neutrino flux".

*** Intensity Frontier widens
</h1> <p>
A Project X workshop, with well over 200 participants, explored 
the potential science that the unprecedented intensities of 
Project X would make possible. If super-symmetry is discovered at 
the LHC, one of the most compelling challenges will be to connect 
super-symmetry to neutrino physics via the study of charged lepton 
flavor violation.   Besides neutrinos, there was interest in
muons, kaons and anti-protons.
