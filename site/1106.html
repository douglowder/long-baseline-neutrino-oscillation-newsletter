*** T2K sees excess of events consistent with theta_13

Results from 1.43E20 pot (before earthquake) has 6 electron signal 
observed and 1.5+/-0.3 BG expected.  This is 0.7% probability to 
\theta_13=0 (significance: 2.5 sigma) and the 90% allowed region 
for the Normal hierarchy is 0.03 < sin^2(2\theta_13) < 0.28 with a 
best 0.11.  Inverted: 0.04 < sin^2(2\theta_13) < 0.34, best 0.14.
The 
experiment is described at

*** MINOS sees excess of events consistent with theta_13

MINOS showed data from 8e20 pot and with an improved particle ID
(called Library Event Matching LEM), gained 30% in sensitivity.  
The data was 62 events with 49.5+-2.8+-7 background.  Best fit to 
sin^2(2\theta_13) 0.04(0.08) normal(inverted) & excludes 0 at 89% 
CL.  See

*** Global fits to theta13 by Fogli et al
</H1> <P>
"Our global analysis of all the available data provides >3 sigma 
evidence for nonzero theta(13), with 1-sigma ranges sin^2 theta_13
= 0.021+-0.007 or 0.025+-0.007, depending on reactor neutrino flux 
systematics."

*** Marx committee report on underground science shown to HEPAP
</H1> <P>

The DOE Review of Options for Underground Science was released.  It 
gives price ranges for DOE management at Homestake for LBNE, 0nu-
beta-beta(DBD) & Dark Matter experiments & compares to SNOLAB for 
the last 2.  No recommendations but 11 "major conclusions":  
1) accuracy level of cost estimates; 2) TPC is $1.2-1.5B for LBNE, 
0.1B for each DM, 0.2-0.3 for each DBD, $18-23M/yr for operations;
3) If LBNE is not at 4850, add $0.15B; 4) Standalone experiments 
at Homestake are not cost effective; 5) 7400 ft level experiments 
prohibitively expensive; 6) Shafts need modernization; 7) DM & DBD 
at SNOLAB appears cost effective; 8) The LBNE, DBD & DM time scale 
is 20 years; 9) Locating a facility in the U.S. would help to 
promote U.S. leadership in these fields for the foreseeable future; 
10) there is a very significant strategic benefit to making the 
LBNE technology choice (water/argon) as soon as possible; 
11) There are advantages to the 1+1 (water+argon) option.
 
<H1>
*** Appropriations committee report has Homestake language
</H1> <P>
The House Energy and Water Committee for DOE High Energy Physics 
reported out $797.2M compared to $795.4M in FY11 and $797.2 
requested by the Administration.  Language in the bill included 
"As the Department weighs alternatives, the Committee cautions the 
Department against taking over the construction and long-term 
management of DUSEL. Adopting management of yet another laboratory 
site would add budgetary and management burdens to an already 
stressed program. However, the Committee supports the use of 
funding to maintain the viability of the DUSEL underground lab, 
including dewatering and maintaining security, in order to 
preserve it as an option while the Department weighs the 
alternatives. Further, the Department is directed to report to the 
Committee an assessment of alternatives to DUSEL and its 
recommendations for moving forward."  2 sides got words in there.

<H1>
*** DOE & Homestake - next step
</H1> <P>
The National Research Council will come out with a report on
underground science.   Then Bill Brinkman will decide the DOE's 
approach to managing Homestake for LBNE, DBD & DM.

<H1>
*** MINOS+, MINOS+, so good they named it twice
</H1> <P>
A large subset of the MINOS collaboration has proposed to Fermilab
to continue running the two MINOS detectors in the NuMI beam for 3
years starting 2013.  The "medium energy" setting will allow the
Far Detector to collect 10,000 charged current and 3,000 neutral
current events 4-10 GeV and make stringent tests for non-standard 
interactions, sterile nus, extra dimensions, time-of-flight, etc. 

<H1>
*** A Big Plus for MINOS+
</H1> <P>
At the June PAC, MINOS+ was given Stage 1 Approval by FNAL.

<H1>
*** Award for Neutrino Physicist Jenny Thomas
</H1> <P>
MINOS and MINOS+ cospokesperson Jenny Thomas from University
College London was named to be given an award by the Order of the
British Empire at a future ceremony at Buckingham Palace.

*** End of long-baseline news web mirror in Europe
</H1> <P>
Due to changes in the web server at Rutherford lab, the European
mirror of long-baseline news and the neutrino oscillation industry
web sites will be discontinued soon. Change links if you use RAL.

*** The battle of Fort Sumter and the neutrino
</H1> <P>
In honor of the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Fort Sumter,
South Carolina is updating its historical markers.  One in Aiken
South Carolina honors the discovery of the neutrino at Savannah 
River.
