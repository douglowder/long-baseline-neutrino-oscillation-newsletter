*** Too few nu-e;  SuperK results on Solar neutrinos</h1>
With 201.6 days livetime, and comparing to the BP95 solar
flux, Super K sees 0.400 + 0.013 - 0.012 (stat) + 0.020 -
0.014 (syst) of the standard Solar model flux with a threshold
of 6.5 MeV.  Above 7.0 MeV the result is 0.409.  This is based
on 3216 events, as opposed to 390 in Kamioka (where the ratio
was more like 0.5).  In and independent
analysis, the results were 0.379 +- 0.017 +- 0.019 and 0.394 +- 0.018
+- 0.019.  An earlier day night difference has gone away.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Too few nu-mu;  SuperK atmospheric results</h1>
Two independent (onsite and offsite) analyses confirm an
atmospheric neutrino deficit in SuperKamiokande.  There are two
analyses.  The offsite analysis gets 1977 events in 196.3 days.
The onsite analysis gets 2126 events in 208.5 days.  Looking at
single ring events only below 1.33 GeV only, in one
analysis they see 476 (mu-d), 467(e-d), 5566(mu-mc), 3666(e-mc)
for a ratio of ratios 0.67 +- 0.05 +- 0.06.  The Monte Carlo is
obviously for a larger exposure.  The other analysis gets
466, 459, 1072, 676 for 0.64 +- 0.04 +- 0.06.  As a function
of fiducial volume, the ratios are flat, so the effect is not
due to neutrons.   In the "multi-GeV range" they get 0.52 +- 0.09
+- 0.06.

*** Neutrino funding guarantee</h1>
The number of conversations with me which have been prefaced by
"Please don't put this in the newsletter," is exponentially
increasing.  To counter this disturbing trend, I am henceforth
providing a guarantee that when your experiment is mentioned
in Long-Baseline Neutrino News, your funding will increase.
(For the moment, this offer does not apply to theorists.)

<p> </p><h1>
*** CHORUS/NOMAD results</h1>
Nomad has new limits on numu to nue and numu to nutau.  For numu
to nutau, they have zero events in tau--&gt; e and tau--&gt;pi.  They
set a limit on P of 0.002 or 0.004 on sin^2 2theta for high mass.
nu-e's are about 1% of the beam.  Using the measured numu,
numubar and nuebar spectra they can predict the nue contributions
from K+'s, mu+'s and K-longs.  They can then use the difference
in predicted and observed nue energy distributions to limit
oscillations.  They get sin^2 2theta less than 0.0015 above
10eV^2, which contradicts LSND's result except at lower masses.
CHORUS has no nutau candidates from 200 kg of emulsion, leading to
a mixing angle limit 0.008.  When all of their data is scanned,
their limit can approach 0.0003.

*** CERN neutrino considerations</h1>
The CERN SPSC considered a LOI (the proposal will be next step)
from the combined CHORUS/NOMAD groups to do a new short baseline
experiment with 3 tons of emulsion in the UA1 (NOMAD) magnet.
The timescale would be technical run in 2001 and data taking
2002-2004 and projected sensitivity 2X COSMOS.

<p> </p><h1>
*** New mu to e gamma limit</h1>
The previous mu to e gamma limit is 5 10^-11.  But this is based
on a result with 50 candidates.  MEGA presented a new analysis
based on 20% of their data, with no candidates and a limit on
B of 4.2 10^-11.  This result is sensitive to the same lepton
violating processes as neutrino oscillations, though a sub-eV
neutrino coupled with no new physics until the GUT scale
leads to a B of ~ 10^-50.

<p> </p><h1>
*** CHOOZ starts up;  SNO  Still Not Operational</h1>
One of the reactors at CHOOZ has been started and has
reached 50% power.   They have 5 tons of Gd loaded scintillator
in a tank.  Palo Verde is planning to start with 12 tons of
segmented detector in late 1997.   SNO is carefully building
their tank, with expected data in 1998.  A piece of their
sphere had to be replaced because, "...if it breaks, you have
8 kilotons of not-so-heavy water, some unhappy Canadians, and
no experiment".

<p> </p><h1>
*** LSND Decay-in-flight results due soon</h1>
When completed, the LSND mu decay in flight analysis will have
different systematics and backgrounds from the decay at rest
analysis.  The energy is higher, but the distance is greater
and the statistics is lower, so a new result will be sensitive
to a similar region of delta-msquared for the two analyses.
A paper is expected in 2-3 weeks and a presentation at the
Big Sky conference on nuclear/particle physics intersections.

*** Four neutrino working groups at Main Injector Workshop</h1>
There are working groups on short-baseline, long-baseline,
booster neutrinos, and non-oscillation physics.  The booster
neutrino working group is being organized by Janet Conrad
() and Geoffrey Mills
().  Schedules for all working groups
are at http://www.fnal.gov/projects/numi/workshop/wgroups.html
A web page for BOONE, the BOOster Neutrino Experiment is now
available at the neutrino oscillation industry web page
http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/nu_industry.html
Also there now is a web page for the Erice nu summer school in
Sept. - http://www.ccsem.infn.it/ccsem97/faessler.html

<p> </p><h1>
*** Ultimate neutrino web page moves
</h1>Juha Peltoniemi's ultimate neutrino web page has moved to
http://www.physics.helsinki.fi/neutrino/  Most of the data
are now up to date, with proper references to original
publications.  Please update your links.
