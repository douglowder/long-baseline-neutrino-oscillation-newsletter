*** SNOWMASS neutrino meeting for APS study June 28-30.
</h1>
What do neutrino physicists want to do?  What do neutrino
physicists need to do in the US?  The APS neutrino study will
hold a meeting at Snowmass to discuss these issues and write a
report, as a conclusion to its yearlong study.

*** Double CHOOZ proposal
</h1>
The best current limit on theta13 comes from looking at the CHOOZ
limit at the Super-K delta msquared.   More sensitivity than
CHOOZ requires more Gigawatt-ton-years and better control of
systematic errors.  Hence an obvious solution is to go back with
a bigger detector, a near detector, and a longer run.  That's
just what Double CHOOZ proposes to do.  A letter of intent is
available at
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0405032"> hep-ex/0405032 </a>
Already approved in France, this is
working through the funding agencies in Germany and elsewhere.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Theta13 from solar
</h1>
At lower values of delta-msquared, CHOOZ limits nothing.  But if
theta13 were large, solar results are affected.  Global analyses
are required, such as in
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0309130"> hep-ph/0309130 </a>
by Maltoni et al.  The
best fit is actually sin^2 theta13 = 0.006, but values greater
than 0.1 are ruled out at all dm^2 (Figure 8.)

<p> </p><h1>
*** Theta13 from reactors
</h1>
Besides Double CHOOZ, reactor theta13 experiment ideas include Angra
(Brazil), Braidwood(Illinois, US), Daya Bay (China), Diablo
Canyon (California, US) and KASKA (Japan).

<p> </p><h1>
*** Theta13 from the atmosphere
</h1>
A non-zero value of theta13 will affect the atmospheric numu to
nue ratio, but only through matter effects, and it is more
apparent if theta_23 is large (larger than 45 degrees).  Large
exposures (1500 kt-years) are needed.  See
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0312038"> hep-ph/0312038 </a>

<p> </p><h1>
*** Theta13 from supernovae
</h1>
Matter conversion resonances can affect neutrino fluxes measured
from a supernova, and there is sensitivity to theta13.  Dighe and
Smirnov discussed this in
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9907423">
Phys Rev D62, 033007, hep-ph/9907423
</a>

<p> </p><h1>
*** Theta13 at accelerators
</h1>
Ideas for exploring theta13 at accelerators include using the
long-baseline experiments, building superbeams and/or off-axis
experiments  (T2K and NOvA), neutrino factories and beta beams.
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0405081">
hep-ph/0405081 </a> looks at the possibility to exploit a high energy
beta beam without a massive detector.  With a gamma of 2500, a
search for nue to numu could be done using the Gran Sasso rock as
the target and detecting the muons in a 15 x 15 m^2 detector.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Theta13 and Ue3
</h1>
Luckily theta13 is a fairly common notation and doesn't have too
many other names.  (Glashow calls the angles theta1, 2 and 3, and
says that others talk too much, but luckily he is in a shrinking
minority.)  But even with only one name, limits are quoted for
theta13 in radians, in degrees, sin^2(2 theta13), sin^2(theta13),
and sin(theta13).  A possibly useful table for conversions is at
<a href="http://www.neutrinooscillation.org/theta13table.html">
http://www.neutrinooscillation.org/theta13table.html.
</a>

<p> </p><h1>
*** sin theta13 = 0.13
</h1>
If so, the angle is aptly named.  This prediction is based
on what Harrison and Scott call "The Simplest Nu Mass Matrix"
and is derived from the measured delta m^2.

*** Beyond theta13
</h1>
Joe Formaggio is leading a working group interested in
interesting additional physics that can be uniquely probed by low
energy neutrinos produced in reactors,  called "Beyond theta13".

*** European joint lab for Frejus &amp; Gran Sasso?
</h1>
Ideas were reviewed at a workshop at CERN in May.
<a href="http://physicsatmwatt.web.cern.ch/physicsatmwatt/">
http://physicsatmwatt.web.cern.ch/physicsatmwatt/ </a>
"DSM, IN2P3 and the INFN agreed to prepare the design of a very
Large Underground Laboratory in the new Frejus tunnel, with
complementary features with respect to the Gran Sasso laboratory,
to be submitted as a joint proposal to the French and Italian
governments.  The institutions aim at associating the Frejus and
Gran Sasso laboratories in a single entity, a European joint
laboratory, open to the world scientific community, to carry out
advanced experiments in particle, astroparticle and nuclear
physics in the coming decades, on topics such as matter
stability, neutrino mixing and mass, stellar collapses and
nuclear astrophysics."

<p> </p><h1>
*** The Neutrinoless Universe?
</h1>
Nicole Bell won the Tollestrup Award for her work on the relic
neutrino abundance and neutrino mass.  Adding neutrino
oscillation to the calculation of the chemical potential of relic
neutrinos was a big improvement.  But if there is coupling to a
new light boson, all relic neutrinos could have annihilated.
