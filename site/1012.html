<H1>Long-Baseline news, December 2010 </H1>
<P> 

<H1>
*** CERN yellow book 2010-03 on neutrinos
</H1> <P>
The proceedings of the CERN workshop on European Strategy for 
future neutrino physics held on Oct 1-3 2009 is now out.  See:

http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/1240330/files/cern-2010-003.pdf
</A>
It includes also the summary published by the Neutrino Panel of 
the CERN Scientific Policy Committee in March 2010.  This is an
excellent source to understand the current state of neutrino
physics and how Europe might contribute in the future.

*** Antineutrinos in NOvA
</H1> <P>
NOvA has seen its first neutrinos in the NDOS (Near Detector
on the Surface) which is running in the way-off-axis NuMI beam.
In 2013 the far detector will be commissioned in Ash River
Minnesota, and a near detector at a similar off-axis angle will
be running underground at Fermilab.

<H1>
*** Antineutrinos in Double Chooz
</H1> <P>
The Double Chooz far detector is now filled and running. Here is
a link to a press release on the subject.

*** Neutrinos in the completed Ice Cube detector
</H1> <P>
On the 18th of December, just before 6 PM South Pole local time,
IceCube installed its 86th and final string of photomultipliers 
deep in Antarctic ice.  This ended a long journey that began with 
the installation of the first string in January 2005.  Each string 
of the completed array holds 60 PMT's.  80 of the strings have 
nominal 17m PMT spacings, while 6 (the Deep Core subarray) are 
more densely packed.  IceCube plans to take data for 15 years.

<H1>
*** Neutrinos in CNGS/Opera
</H1> <P>
In 2010 the SPS delivered 4.03e19 protons on target to the CNGS. 
The overall efficiency for the accelerator complex was 82%.  The 
OPERA detector ran smoothly with an efficiency close to 100% and 
collected 4250 events in the target during 187 days of run.  The 
2011 run is expected to be Mar-Nov. Extrapolating the 2010 
performance, OPERA should collect in 2011 a number of pot larger 
than 2010.  The analysis of the 08-09 data set is in progress. 

<H1>
*** More Antineutrinos for MiniBooNE
</H1> <P>
The request for continued MiniBooNE antineutrino running was 
granted by the Fermilab PAC.  No exact POT goal was given, but it 
is open ended, so they will run as long as taking the extra data 
is deemed useful, i.e. 10E20 POT or more.  Their goal is 15e20 pot
by Feb 2013, and 10e20 is likely by the 2012 shutdown.

*** LBNE Project solves 2 problems; faces 3 more
</H1> <P>
The LBNE executive committee recommended that the reference design
for CD1; i.e. one 200 kt Water Cherenkov Detector plus one 17 kt
Liquid Argon Detector was the preferable one for physics.  Also,
a document representing a consensus view of collaboration
management, collaboration leadership, lab management and the
DOE has been reached on the prioritized physics goals.  The
primary objectives are 1.1 Search for an precision measurement
of numu to nue oscillations, including theta_13, phase delta
and mass ordering;  1.2 Precision measurements of theta_23
and Delta msquared_32; 1.3 proton decay; 1.4 neutrinos from
a core collapse supernova in our galaxy, if there is one.
Secondary objectives, additional secondary objectives, and
primary and secondary objectives of the near detector are also
specified.  But LBNE faces 3 near-term challenges: 1.) Issues
related to DUSEL funding and NSF/DOE cooperation; 2.) The cost
estimate.  Detailed costings of the beam and detectors exceed
the upper bound of ~$1B given by the DOE.  Value engineering/
cost cutting while maintaining the scientific capabilities are
in progress.  3.)  There is no FY2011 budget yet, and this
may (or may not) get coupled with a "no new starts" this year.

<H1>
*** Neutrino Schools during summer 2011 and 2012
</H1> <P>
The 2011 Neutrino summer school, originally scheduled for LNGS on
18-30 Jul, is moved to somewhere in Switzerland, a small country.  
The International School on Astro-Particle physics will be on the 
Dark Side of the Universe in Heidelberg, 8-15 July.  A Florence
GGI neutrino workshop "What's nu?" will be held 11 June - 14 July 2012
at the Galileo Galilei Institute in Florence.  Links to all
are kept at

*** Suspicious Neutrino Conference
</H1> <P>
In even numbered years, there is a neutrino meeting sponsored by 
the International Neutrino Commission.  In odd-numbered years
there is a Weak Interactions and Neutrino (WIN) workshop.  But
a web page 
<A href="http://www.waset.org/conferences/2011/rome/icnpa/">
http://www.waset.org/conferences/2011/rome/icnpa/
</A>
has appeared from a publishing company about an "International 
Conference on Neutrino Physics and Astrophysics".  (WASET) It 
looks like a for-profit meeting, similar to several I see in
unwanted email blasts.  There is no link to any scientific 
secretariat who knows anything about neutrinos.  So I won't link
it to the neutrino meetings page unless someone vouches for it.
The paper submission deadline has passed anyway.
