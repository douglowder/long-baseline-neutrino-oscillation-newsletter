Dear Long-baseline News readers,
<br>

Maury is kindly allowing the NUSL-Homestake group to circulate
<br>

the following response to the recent NY Times article critical
<br>

of the indemnity legislation.  The Times article contained a
<br>

number of inaccuracies.  We have posted the full text of the
<br>

legislation in the "documents" section of the NUSL web site:
<br>

1) The only land being transferred is a 140-acre parcel, not the
<br>

entire mine, as the Times implied.  Included in the lands Homestake
<br>

will retain are all areas it deems of potential environmental
<br>

concern, including the milling complex and the holding pond.
<br>



2) The indemnity legislation does not, as the Times states, free
<br>

the Homestake Company from liability, both because of 1) and
<br>

because only civil matters are covered.  If, in the area proposed
<br>

for transfer, Homestake were to hide any condition or commit
<br>

any other act of negligence, it could be held responsible.
<br>



3) The legislation places stringent conditions on reclammation
<br>

and transfer.  All of land proposed for transfer will
<br>

be inspected by experts appointed by the EPA.  The information
<br>

gathered will include public hearings in which any citizen can
<br>

express concerns.  The inspectors will submit their report
<br>

to the EPA, which can then order any additional reclammation it
<br>

feels is warranted.  No transfer of land can take place without
<br>

a complete EPA bill-of-health.  Of course, the transfer is also
<br>

contingent on a positive decision by the NSF to proceed with NUSL.
<br>


    Homestake has been engaged for many months in costly
<br>

reclammation efforts to ensure compliance with EPA standards.
<br>


4) The need for limited indemnity is due to federal law which
<br>

holds all former landowners liable for problems that may occur
<br>

in future years.  NUSL will involve excavations and materials
<br>

(cryogens, flammables, etc) that are a cause for concern.
<br>

In addition, an owner who, in good faith, releases land believed
<br>

to be fully restored, can be charged with negligence for
<br>

transferring the land, should a problem later arise.  Finally,
<br>

Superfund law allows third parties to initiate actions on behalf
<br>

of the federal government.
<br>

     For these reasons mining companies prefer to retain title
<br>

to abandoned mines, leaving caretakers to control access and
<br>

monitor the environment.  Homestake recognizes that NUSL will
<br>

expose its stockholders to additional risk, in the absence of
<br>

limited indemnity from the government.
<br>



5) In the worst case scenario of an environmental hazard unknown
<br>

to Homestake and undiscovered by the EPA, the creation of NUSL
<br>

provides an additional safety margin.  Establishing NUSL will
<br>

likely keep the mine dry and occupied for another 50 years.
<br>

    During that half century, many of the world's best earth
<br>

scientists and geomicrobiologists will be involved in Homestake
<br>

research.  When the time comes to close NUSL, we will know far
<br>

more about Homestake's hydrology and ecology than we do now.  Should
<br>

anything develop that affects our confidence in the safety of
<br>

eventual closure, we would be able to act accordingly.
<br>


6) While mining companies often have a poor public image, in
<br>

fairness one should keep in mind Homestake's record.  It has a
<br>

40-year history of hosting scientists at Lead -- physicists,
<br>

geologists, and ecologists.  It has previously worked with
<br>

scientists in converting mine property to public use: one
<br>

result is the McLaughlin Ecological Reserve in California,
<br>

which UC operates.  Homestake's environmental record is a strong
<br>

one, with one example being its policy of applying US
<br>

environmental standards to its operations in less developed
<br>

countries.
