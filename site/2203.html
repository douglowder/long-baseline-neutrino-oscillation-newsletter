*** Neutrino Snowmass Topical Working Group reports
</H1> <P>
White papers for Snowmass have mostly been turned in, and the 10
neutrino working groups are writing their drafts reports, which
are due 10 May 2022.  Feedback is welcomed at least through
10 April.  
<A href="https://snowmass21.org/neutrino:start:drafts">
https://snowmass21.org/neutrino:start:drafts.  
</A>
Use the
feedback forms there.  The success of Snowmass  depends on wide
community participation. Outlines follow.  If you wrote a white
paper, you should check that it is mentioned appropriately.

*** Neutrino physicist comments on shelling of nuclear power plant

Why was Zaporizhzhia, the largest artificial nu source in Europe,
attacked?  There was no good reason.  Naba Mondal explained to his
Bengali audience that there was no short-term radioactivity danger
there, but in this situation there were possibilities of various
nuclear facilities getting damaged and some exposure to the many
in the area.

*** rant: In defense of stovepiping
</H1> <P>
Well, not really.  But there was a great deal of discussion at the
neutrino frontier workshop about how funding boundaries, such as
between NP and HEP were frustrating researchers as they try to put
together exciting research programs.  An oft-mentioned example is
how the measurement of theta-12 in solar neutrinos was defined to
be nuclear physics, while the measurement of theta-13 in reactor
and accelerator physics was high-energy physics.  But the field
now has good measurements of both parameters.  The fundamental
constraint is that there will always be more good ideas for new
experiments than money, even if 100% of GNP were available.  When
a funding agency has to say no, people want reasons, and it is
easier to say "We don't do that," than "Your good idea was not as
good as another good idea."  Multidisciplinary projects do happen.

*** Retiring SURF employee Charlie Roth told Ray Davis the weather
</H1> <P>
“The only time I ever talked to Dr. Davis was on the cage, he
asked me my name and then said, ‘Charlie, what is the atmospheric
condition on the surface?’ What he meant was ‘What is the
temperature?’ Yeah, I had to think about that for a minute, you
know. Everyone else would just ask, ‘What it’s doing outside?’ but
he wanted to know about the atmospheric condition.”
