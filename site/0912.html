*** New neutrino intensity record for NuMI beam at Fermilab
</H1> <P>
Fermilab Today reports, "The new record for one day with most 
protons on target is 13.3e17, set on Dec. 26, 2009. Prior to 
the current running period, which began on Oct. 1, 2009, the 
protons on target record for a single day was 12.2e17, set on 
April 14, 2009. Since Oct. 1, that record has been broken 17 
times, including 10 of the 14 days during the holiday period."

*** Neutrino Factory International Design Study meets 8-10 April
</H1> <P>
The fifth plenary meeting of the International Design Study for 
the Neutrino Factory (the IDS-NF) will take place at FNAL from 
8-10 April 2010.  The main goal for the IDS-NF this year is the 
preparation of the Interim Design Report (IDR).  The meeting will 
focus on reviewing the status of the design work with a view to 
defining the content of the IDR.  The WWW page for the meeting can
be accessed from 
<A href="https://www.ids-nf.org/wiki/FrontPag"> 
https://www.ids-nf.org/wiki/FrontPage </A>
or directly 
at the meeting page.

*** MINOS,  New cospokesperson, & Deputy & rocks
</H1> <P>
After serving as spokesperson and cospokesperson of MINOS for 15 
years, Stan Wojcicki stepped down in Dec 2009, but will continue 
as an active collaborator.  Professor Jenny Thomas from University 
College London was elected to a 3 year term as cospokesperson, 
serving along with Fermilab's Rob Plunkett.  Karol Lang from 
University of Texas-Austin was chosen as deputy.  Previous beam 
results have been based on contained nu events, but one thesis 
(McGowan 07) studied neutrino oscillations using muons which 
started outside the fiducial volume including the upstream rock.  
Such rock event analyses are also being conducted to complement 
anti-neutrino studies.

<H1>
*** NOvA spokesperson election & rocks
</H1> <P>
The term of Mark Messier from Indiana as cospokesperson of NOvA is 
up for election or reelection, to serve along with Gary Feldman 
from Harvard.  Despite the cold weather up in International Falls 
Minnesota, progress is being made on the far detector building.  
One problem that has been encountered is that some of the rock 
which needs to hold up the buildings' walls has sheared away 
during the blasting of the underground part.  Experts have been called.

<H1>
*** MINERvA, new cospokesperson; & a hard plate.
</H1> <P>
Debbie Harris (Fermilab) has been elected to replace Jorge Morfin 
(Fermilab) as the MINERvA cospokesperson with Kevin McFarland from 
the University of Rochester.  MINERvA is in the process of 
finishing the installation of its detector, which includes a 
number of large iron plates that had previously been assembled at 
the wide band photon lab on the other side of Fermilab.  These plates, with a 
"strong back" attached, are 3 m x 7 m and weigh 6000 kg. They pose 
a traffic hazard as they extend 1 m beyond the sides of the truck. 
Orange flags warn other drivers of the wide load. A lead vehicle 
with yellow flashing lights escorts the flatbed truck during each 
transport as the truck moves across the Fermilab site.  Some 
drivers chose to pass the truck even though there was insufficient 
road width to do so safely.  If its you, stop it.

<H1>
*** Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment, 1st spokespeople; & rocks
</H1> <P>
The LBNE collaboration for a long-baseline neutrino experiment
from Fermilab to Homestake in South Dakota, has elected its
co-spokespersons.  They are Robert Svoboda from University of 
California Davis and Milind Diwan from Brookhaven National Lab.  
Seismic tests and drilling on the Fermilab site started in 
December to collect geological information relevant for design of 
underground tunnels for the new beam.  The most visible drilling 
in January will be near Kirk and Giese roads on the west side of 
the laboratory. At this location engineers will collect soil 
samples to 20m and rock samples to 220m.

*** 5 year plan for Muon collider/neutrino factory
</H1> <P>
There is a resurgence of interest in a muon collider as part
of Fermilab's future.  A draft of the 5-year R&D program can
be found at

A nice article about the possibility can be found in Science.
