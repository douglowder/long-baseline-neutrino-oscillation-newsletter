<p>
</p><h1>Soudan Atmospheric result</h1>
The first announcement of the preliminary Soudan 2
atmospheric ratio of ratios for nu-mu to nue was
announced at the DPF meeting, .55 +- .27 +- .10.
Standing by itself, it is less than a 2 sigma effect,
but together with the statistically more significant
Kamioka and IMB results, it adds to the atmospheric hint
of a muon neutrino deficit.  It is based on 0.5 kt-year
of data, which is about half of the present exposure.

<h1>DPF Meeting--other</h1>
Other highlights of the DPF meeting were a number of
consistent MSW analyses of the four solar neutrino
experiments, the rather convincing death of the 17 keV
neutrino, an excellent presentation on NUMI by Bill
Reay, and a failure by one theorist to explain the
atmospheric neutrino problem as a nuclear effect.  One
item outside neutrino physics was dubbed the
"Ooops-Ting".

<h1>P822 will also test the equivalence principle.</h1>
A mechanism for neutrino mixing due to a new
gravitational interaction has been considered by J.
Pantaleone et al.  Amazingly the required parameter
space (which violates the equivalence principle at the
level of 10**-15) is the SAME for the solar neutrino and
atmospheric neutrino problems!  Not yet covered at
accelerators, it can be definitively tested by P803 and
P822.

<h1>New radiation guidelines save money!!!!!!!!!!!!</h1>
At the November 11th NUMI meeting, Anthony Malensek
showed the effect of the new proposed radiation
guidelines on the size of the NUMI beam if it was built
in the dolomite, rather than the glacial till.  He
showed a beam line which was a maximum of 4.9 meters
in diameter for the protected region, as opposed to
about three times as large in the May 91 CDR (blue
book).  Costs for the new beam have not yet been
calculated, but the savings will be considerable.

<h1>P860</h1>
The proposal by W. Lee et al. for a electron neutrino
experiment using a muon storage ring in the anti-proton
accumulator will be presented to the December FNAL PAC
meeting.   P803 has shown they can do one item of
physics, numu to nu-e oscillations at a comparable level
( a few 10**-4 mixing angle).  The analysis involves using
nu-e quasielastic events and normalizing the beam where
the nu-e fraction (from Ke3 decays) is high (5% at
30-40 GeV) and looking where the expected nu-e fraction
is much lower (&lt;.1% at 4-12 GeV).

<h1>And now for something Different--Geology</h1>
The new detector hall will be over 100 feet down, in the
Silurian System's Kankakee and Joliet Dolomite.  In
order to study these rock formations, we found a quarry
where these strata are exposed, down to 200 feet in
Elmhurst, owned by the Elmhurst Chicago Stone
Company.  We will be arranging a visit to inspect these
rock formations in the near future.

They suggest that using the IMB (and Kamioka and Baksan)
upward muon fluxes doesn't set any limit on nu-mu to
nu-tau when flux uncertainties are included.
