*** NOvA sees numu disappearance and nue appearance
</H1> <P>
The 1st results from the NOvA experiment were presented in August.
<A href="http://nova-docdb.fnal.gov/cgi-bin/ShowDocument?docid=13883">

</A>
With a "full-detector-equivalent" exposure of 2.74e20pot,
33 numu CC events are identified, with 201 expected in the absence
of oscillations (including 3 background).  The best oscillation
fits (which are good) are for dmsq_32 = 2.37 +0.16 -0.15 e-3 eV^2
(NO), and -2.40 +0.14 -0.17 (IO) and sin^2(q_23) = 0.51+-0.10.
Appearance was measured using two id algorithms, Likelihood ID
(LID) & Library Event Matching (LEM). Prior to unblinding, it was
decided to show both results and to use LID as the primary result.
For both PIDs, 6 events are expected for NO, 2 for IO, and 1 BG.
NOvA measured 6 events for LID (3.3 sigma for appearance) and
11 events for LEM (5.5 sigma).  Data should double by next summer.

*** "Oscillating neutrinos" for the first time ever?
</H1> <P>
<A href="http://natmonitor.com/2015/08/08/scientists-stunned-after-witnessing-oscillating-neutrinos-could-unlock-secrets-of-big-bang/">

</A>
When you're excited about your results, you try to share that
excitement as widely as possible.  It is certainly possible to be
misunderstood.   One reporter translated the first results from
NOvA on neutrino oscillations as the first ever observation of
neutrino oscillations.  This might be a good time to point out the
caveat on the homepage of this newsletter.  Please tell me if/when
I report something wrong.

*** Can neutrino models predict oscillation parameters?
</H1> <P>
In 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06063"> arXiv:1508.06063 </A>, 
Rodejohann and Xu investigate the stability
of neutrino mass matrix predictions on important and currently
unknown observables.  They show how perturbations change the
predictions.  A larger neutrino mass (e.g. 0.1 eV) makes things
unstable.  It does not mean that models cannot predict anything,
it is just supposed to illustrate that corrections to models need
to be taken into account before predictions are claimed.

*** IceCube Neutrinos highlight of Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC)
</H1> <P>
The 34th Annual Cosmic Ray Conference added "The Astrophysical
Conference" to its name.  
<A href="http://icrc2015.nl/"> 
http://icrc2015.nl/  </A>
It was great to sit
for a week and hear hundreds of references to neutrinos without
discussion of the Higgs.  A clear highlight of the conference this
year was the IceCube astrophysical neutrinos, with other searches,
possible explanations, and proposed studies.  Neutrinos are a
robust leg of the "Multi-Messenger" approach to understanding cosmic
rays.  See e.g.

*** J-PARC upgrade could triple T2K beam flux in Japan
</H1> <P>

(The password is in the window that comes up.)  At a workshop on
JPARC, an upgrade of the accelerator to 1.3 MW is planned.  The
Main Ring has a design power of 750 kW in 2018-19 and will reach
1 MW with new power supplies after 2020.  It will be able to
operate at 1.3 MW before 2026 with improvements.  The integrated
number of protons on target could reach 21D21 before 2026, 3 times
the current T2K, and could measure nu CP violation with > 3 sigma.

*** NNN 2015
</H1> <P>
The NNN15/UD2 workshop will be at Stony Brook 28-31 Oct.  With the
generous support by sponsors, the registration fee is low, $100.
Grad students and postdocs are strongly encouraged to attend.
Funds are available to provide support for lodging/registration.
Grad students presenting a poster will be given priority for
financial support.  The deadline for abstract & financial support
is 18 Sep, 2015.

*** Gadolinium approved for use in Super-Kamiokande
</H1> <P>

</A>
The idea to add Gadolinium, to help in the identification of final
state neutrons in low energy neutrino events, originally dubbed
GADZOOKS!, has been approved, but the name will be SuperK-Gd.
Tests with EGADS (Evaluating Gadolinium's Action on Detector
Systems) worked well.  The next step is to drain the tank, check
for leaks and fix them, replace bad phototubes, and then refill.
