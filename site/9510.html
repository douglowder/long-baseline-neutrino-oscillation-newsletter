<p> </p><h1> *** Gran Sasso Long Baseline Workshop </h1>
A longbaseline workshop will be held at Gran Sasso November 9-10.
In a statement from Lab Director Piero Monacelli, the approval of
LHC has made realistic the possibility of a neutrino beam towards
Gran Sasso, dedicated to Long Baseline neutrino oscillation
experiments.  Another important goal of the workshop will be the
reassessment of the physics situation, in view of the present
experimental results and of the imminent start of data taking by
SuperKamiokande.  For workshop information, contact
 and/or .

<p> </p><h1> *** Two LSND results published </h1>
The LSND candidate events for neutrino oscillations were finally
published in the October 2 issue of PRL.  There was also a paper
from James Hill based on the alternative LSND analysis in his
thesis.  A story about the circumstances of the two papers is in
the September 22nd issue of Science.

<p> </p><h1> *** Chooz reactor Experiment Progress </h1>
This experiment is planned near two 4.2 GW reactors in France
which are scheduled to start early in 1996.  The underground
experimental hall is finished. The 140 m^3 main detector tank has
been installed with its low activity shielding in place. The PMT
support structure and the 6 m^3 acrylic tank nu target have been
completed and are in place in the main vessel. The 250 PMT's were
being installed during October.  The electronics is well underway.
The design of the two scintillators (gadolinium-loaded for the Nu
target region and high-flash for the containment and veto regions)
has been fixed and procurement of the materials is in progress.
They expect background runs before the end of the year.

<p> </p><h1> *** San Onofre Reactor Experiment Progress </h1>
This experiment is in California near two reactors which have
been operational since about 1980.  The detector and underground
vault are fully funded.  Final bidding for the underground Lab is
underway.  The detector design is complete and Gd loaded
scintillator developed.  The scintillator is stable and has been
tested in a acrylic tank.  The light output and attenuation length
are fine.  Construction of the underground vault will begin in the
next few months. Detector construction will proceed simultaneously
and is expected to be completed by 1996 Fall.

<p> </p><h1> *** Neutrino Electronics Workshop March 1996 in Saclay. </h1>
A meeting devoted to Electronics for cosmic neutrino detectors
will be in Saclay (France) on March 4-6, 1996.  Topics include
detection modules, the trigger, data transmission and data
acquisition.  Specialists on electronics should attend.  The style
of the meeting will be analogous to toe November 94 Berkeley
meeting on soft-ware.  Organizers are Tonino Capone
(), Bianca Monteleoni (),
Luciano Moscoso () and Leo Resvanis
().

<p> </p><h1> *** MINOS offices at Fermilab </h1>
The MINOS office with terminals and NuMI notes at Fermilab has moved
to 12 west.  The phone number there is 708-840-5407.

<p> </p><h1> *** It's Noble to be Nobel </h1>
The award of the nobel prize for the discovery of the tau and the
discovery of the neutrino makes it that much more important to
discover and study the tau neutrino.

<p> </p><h1> *** transmittal letter </h1>
The Sciulli report was transmitted from HEPAP to DOE's Martha Krebs
along with a transmittal letter signed by acting HEPAP chair
Pieramaria Oddone.  There is a story on the subject in 29
September issue of Science, page 1813.
