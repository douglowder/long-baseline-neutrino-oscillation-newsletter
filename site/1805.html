*** new (first neutrino beam physics) result from MicroBooNE
</H1> <P>
MicroBooNE will someday chime in whether the low energy excess
is due to electrons, photons or both.  In the meantime they
have compared the multiplicity distributions observed to GENIE
model predictions in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06887"> arXiv:1805.06887, </A>
submitted to PRD.  They
used 5e19 800 MeV protons on target (pot). Kinematic distributions
agree well with GENIE, but there is an indication of fewer high
(>3) multiplicity events in the data than in GENIE.

<H1>
*** New results from MiniBooNE, large excess of e-like events
</H1> <P>
MiniBooNE had previously presented results from 6.l4e20 (11.27e20)
pot with nu(antinu).  Now with 12.84e20 pot the excess of e-like
events is 381.2 +- 85.2 (4.5 sigma) E_nu between 200 & 1250 MeV.
Combining LSND/MiniBooNE the excess is 6.1 sigma.  The excess
above 475 MeV (the original blinded cut) is low.

*** New and Final results from OPERA long-baseline experiment
</H1> <P>

</A>
They now have ten tau-nu candidates appearing in the LNGS beam.

<H1>
*** Call for proposals for projects at the CERN nu Platform
</H1> <P>
The CERN Neutrino Platform supports generic detector R&D for large
nu detectors.  There may be opportunities for new projects after
the 2018 long shutdown.

*** HEPAP approves DOE-HEP portfolio review -- Nus shine
</H1> <P>
The DOE reviewed 13 non-LHC running experiments in its "portfolio
review".  The highest priority was given to nu experiments NOvA & T2K
and also DES and eBOSS.

*** DOE funding
</H1> <P>
While the president had proposed a 14% cut for the Office of
Science (which funds HEP in the US), the house (senate) bill
currently proposes a 5% (6%) increase.  A proposed amendment
from a former neutrino physicist would add $50m.  See simplicity:

*** Hyper-Kamiokande Design Report
</H1> <P>
See 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04163"> arXiv:1805.04163 </A>
(333 pages).   The Hyper-Kamiokande detector
will be hosted in the Tochibora mine, 295 km away from the J-PARC
accelerator research complex in Tokai, Japan. J-PARC is being
steadily upgraded to reach a MW beam by the start of Hyper-K.

<H1>
*** NuFACT registration open, August in Virginia
</H1> <P>
Registration is open for the 20th International Workshop on
Neutrinos from Accelerators (known as NuFACT due to previous
names for the workshop.)  It will be 12-18 August in
Blacksburg Virginia.  
<A href="https://nufact2018.phys.vt.edu/">  
https://nufact2018.phys.vt.edu/
</A>
If you are not familiar with Virginia, don't assume that it is
near Washington DC, because it is not.  Fly to Roanoke.

<H1>
*** Neutrino History registration open, September in Paris
</H1> <P>
Registration is now open for the International Conference on
the "History of the Neutrino" (5-7 September 2018) in Paris
<A href="http://neutrinohistory2018.in2p3.fr/">  
http://neutrinohistory2018.in2p3.fr/. 
</A>
If you are not familiar
with Paris, you should be.

*** Monoenergetic muon neutrinos measured by MiniBooNE
</H1> <P>
They come from Kaon decay-at-rest.  
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03848"> arXiv:1801.03848 </A>

*** neutrinooscillation.org expires
</H1> <P>
As part of the neutrino oscillation industry website,
<A href="http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/">  
http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/, 
</A>
for which the job sites,
meetings, newsletter, and neutrino poetry are still maintained,
the URL neutrinooscillation.org had been used for many years.
Subdomains, such as minos.neutrinooscillation.org had been
defined for most experiments.  But it never became widely
useful or used.  I have let the domain expire, and at some
point is should become available again for another user.
