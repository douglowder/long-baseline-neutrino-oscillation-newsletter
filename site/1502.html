*** Nakaya and Kobayashi win Nishima prize
</H1> <P>
Professor T. Kobayashi (KEK) and professor T. Nakaya (Kyoto) were
awarded the 2014 Nishina Memorial prize for "Discovery of electron
neutrino appearance from muon neutrino beam", in T2K.

*** TOE wins Oscar, XOE loses naming contest for ELBNF
</H1> <P>
Eddie Redmayne won the  best actor Oscar for the portrayal of
Stephen Hawking in the movie "The Theory of Everything".  But XOE,
or eXperiment Of Everything, was one of the 100 names not chosen
as a finalist to replace ELBNF, at the new Long-Baseline Facility.
Other losers were TEFKAL (The Experiment Formerly Known As LBNE/
LBNO), NERDS (NEutrino Research DetectorS), I90 (for the highway
in South Dakota), HEArT (Homestake Electron appearance using an
Ar Tpc), and E1062.  The final 10 are ALADIN, ATHENA, BISON (with
two acronyms), BLADE, DUNE, GOLDEN, LEONARDO, LOLA and NEBULA.

*** Shanahan wins NOvA election for cospokesperson
</H1> <P>
Peter Shanahan from Fermilab has been elected co-spokesperson of
the NOvA experiment as it takes long-baseline neutrino data using
the NuMI beam.  He replaces Harvard's Gary Feldman who is stepping
down and will work with Mark Messier from Indiana University.

<H1>
*** The winners for ELBNF cospokesperson will be
</H1> <P>
2 of six candidates, Sanjib Mishra from South Carolina, Milind 
Diwan from BNL, Chang Kee Jung from Stony Brook, Andre Rubbia from 
Zurich, Mark Thomson from Cambridge, and Bob Wilson from CSU.

<H1>
*** It will be a win-win at WIN 2015
</H1> <P>
The Weak Interactions and Neutrinos Workshop will be 8-13 June in
Heidelberg. 
<A href="http://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/WIN2015/  "> 
http://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/WIN2015/  </A>
This workshop, held
alternately with the International neutrino conference, will
examine the crucial issues of our time; i.e. neutrino physics and
related fields.  The program is posted with parallel sessions on
Electroweak, Neutrino, Flavor, and Astroparticle Physics.  Those 
interested should contact the conveners listed on the web page.

<H1>
*** Fermilab Short-baseline program  wins Stage 1 approval
</H1> <P>
The Fermilab PAC wrote: "The Committee recommends Stage 1 approval
for the SBN program, which incorporates LAr1ND and ICARUS with
MicroBooNE towards a coherent SBN program."  It also recommended
approval for ANNIE, to put a small detector with LAPPDs in the
SciBooNE hall for neutrino induced neutron measurements.  While
the PAC did not endorse NESSIE, it did endorse the physics goals
of the CAPTAIN-MINERvA and CAPTAIN-BNB initiatives to use a liquid
argon tank built by Los Alamos in the booster and NuMI beams.

*** Workshop on the Intermediate Neutrino Program (in the US)
</H1> <P>
At this workshop, a large variety of small experiments were studied
that were new ideas for neutrino measurements, current experiments that
might provide upgrades, future initiatives that may need R&D,
and R&D toward large future experiments.  The program and slides are

*** Funding Opportunity Announcement for small neutrino experiments
</H1> <P>
At some point in the near future, the US Department of Energy is
likely to issue a funding opportunity announcement (FOA) for about
$10M to further the ideas presented at WINP.  The DOE contact
for this will be Eli Rosenberg at

*** Majorana in Venezuela
</H1> <P>
Did Majorana die in a boating accident in 1938 or did he resurface
in Venezuela in 1955-1959?  For some reason that I can't understand,
this issue was before a court in Rome which has decided he was in
Valencia, Venezuela, putting to rest the controversy.

<H1>
*** Majorana in Rome
</H1> <P>
Was he in Rome  in 1981?  I guess we need a new controversy.

<H1>
*** Majorana or Dirac?
</H1> <P>
Of more interest to the 2015 neutrino community is whether the
neutrino is Majorana (its own antiparticle) or Dirac.  Neutrino
Oscillation Experiments cannot distinguish this property, but
neutrinoless double Beta decay experiments can.  If the neutrino
ordering is inverted or degenerate AND if the neutrino is
Majorana, this process will happen at predictable rates (up to
nuclear matrix elements) and could be seen soon.  If the neutrino
is Dirac, it won't happen.  If the mass hierarchy is normal, it
may be too small to be seen for the foreseeable future.

<H1>
*** Majorana in South Dakota
</H1> <P>
The Majorana Demonstrator project, funded by DOE Nuclear Physics
and the NSF aims to establish the feasibility to construct arrays
of Germanium detectors and demonstrate backgrounds low enough to
justify a ton-scale experiment in neutrinoless double beta decay.
It's located at the 4850 level of SURF and will deploy 10 kg of
natural Ge and 30 kg of 86% 76Ge.  Phase I of 7 strings were
deployed last year, and Phase II with 7 more strings should be
up this year.  Gerda Phase II will also take data in 2015.
