*** ELBNF renamed DUNE, Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment
</H1> <P>
The new long-baseline experiment at Fermilab, currently with a
membership of 737 people from 148 institutions in 26 countries, has
chosen the name "Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment" or DUNE.
A contest for a logo (sand is ok, but no worms) will start soon.

The first spokespersons have been elected and are Andre Rubbia from
ETH-Zurich and Mark Thomson from Cambridge.  A collaboration meeting
is scheduled for 16-18 April at Fermilab.

*** LAr1-ND renamed SBND, Short-Baseline Near Detector
</H1> <P>
Several names were suggested for this element of the Fermilab
short-baseline neutrino program, and the first-round winners were
Booster Oscillation Near Detector, The neutrino Liquid Argon Near
Detector and Short-Baseline Near Detector.  Of more interest to some
were some of the losers, such as TEFKAL (The Experiment Formerly
known as LAr1-ND), LBNE (Liquidargon Booster Neutrino Experiment),
NECROBooNE (NEar miCROBooNE), BANANA (Booster-Argon Neutrino Anti-
Neutrino Apparatus), TURKEY (The Ultimate, Righteous, Koolest
Experiment Yet), and LARP (Liquid ARgon Project).

*** Why physicists sometimes disagree
</H1> <P>
If data doesn't agree with the null hypothesis, and it also
doesn't agree with the alternative hypothesis, some physicists
say you need new data. Others say you need a new hypothesis.

*** J-PARC increases intensity for the T2K experiment
</H1> <P>
J-PARC has reached a great milestone, 1e21 protons on target toward
Super-Kamiokande for T2K.  And in February, Tsuyoshi Nakaya
replaced Takashi Kobayashi as the spokesperson for T2K.   For
their work on neutrino physics, Kobayashi has been awarded the
Yomiuri Gold Medal, and Nakaya together with Masato Shiozawa has
been awarded the Yoji Totsuka prize.

*** Slip Stacking increases intensity for NOvA
</H1> <P>
FNAL is now running 2+6 slipstacking on all NuMI cycles.  This has
resulted in an increase of NuMI target power from ~325kW to ~360kW
with the Fixed Target program running.   It reached 453 kW for an hour
and satisfied a goal of running more than 400 kW for 112 hours.

*** Neutrino School at the end of August in Brazil
</H1> <P>
The annual International Neutrino Summer School (INSS) will be in
Sao Paulo, just after NuFACT in Rio.  It is 17-28 August at IFT.

This will focus on the "Universe of neutrinos", 10-21 Aug at SLAC.

*** Neutral Current Quasi-elastic Scattering
</H1> <P>
(Thanks to nu-xsec newsletter) The neutrino community often calls
it "NCEL", nu+A->nu+p+A' because we don't care about the final
state of the nucleus. However, the final state is usually an
excited nucleus, which is not "elastic scattering" in the nuclear
physics sense.  But T2K has measured de-excitation gammas from NC
scattering, 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3140"> arXiv:1403.3140 </A>
so it may be the time to call it NCQE.

On April fool's day there was an announcement of a new cereal box
featuring neutrinos.  It promised, "trillions of the elusive,
invisible particles in every bite."  There was also mention of
GENIE version 999, "every neutrino physicist's dreams come true."
because a neutrino can turn protons into gold.

The ruse was exposed, however, due to unmistakable clues.
