*** BENE activities; November 14-17 meeting in Frascati
</H1>
BENE 
<A href="http://bene.web.cern.ch/bene/ ">
http://bene.web.cern.ch/bene/ </A>
is expected to propose 
a coherent set of FP7 initiatives. This may include 2 Design 
Studies, a Nu Factory & Superbeam and a Beta Beam, and several R&D 
projects ("JRAs") in areas like proton drivers, targets and 
collectors of neutrino parents, mu cooling and mu accelerators &, 
in a framework still to be identified, for nu detectors.  They are 
seeking input and participation.  Note CAREO6/BENE06 meetings - 
Frascati 14-17 Nov.

*** P5 -US Particle Physics Roadmap - on Neutrinos
</H1>
"A global effort to pursue the answers to the open (nu) questions 
has yielded a well-developed experimental program of great 
progress.  The planned nuclear, reactor, accelerator and 
underground nu experiments, and the astrophysical and cosmological 
nu observations, stand to teach us very interesting things..."

*** P5 on Double Beta Decay - CUORE, EXO and Majorana
</H1>
"The 3 techniques to measure 0nu-beta decay should be investigated 
vigorously, leading to a selection of one for an experiment at the 
1-10 ton scale.  One possible decision point is after the parallel 
EXO efforts in barium tagging and EXO-200 search are complete."

<P><H1>
*** P5 on Double Chooz
</H1>
"Double Chooz (has) important contributions from the U.S."

<P><H1>
*** P5 on Daya Bay
</H1>
"A detailed review of the Daya Bay project should be carried out 
ASAP.  This review should focus particularly on the feasibility of 
the approach.  It should evaluate the basis of estimates of the 
systematic uncertainties, along with the additional systematic 
uncertainties induced by moving the detectors.  Conditional on a 
favorable review, (proceed) with planning and construction."

<P><H1>
*** P5 on T2K
</H1>
"We recommend a modest level of U.S. participation in T2K."

<P><H1>
*** P5 on NOvA
</H1>
"Without NOvA, the world loses the chance to look for evidence of 
CP violation in the leptonic sector for a long period of time.  To 
be sure, there is a risk that NOvA Phase 1 will provide no new 
information, depending on unknown mixing parameters.  Still, we 
find the science case is compelling:  there is no other planned 
program worldwide that will have the potential to resolve the mass 
hierarchy and start to probe for CP violation."

<P><H1>
*** EPP2010 on NOvA and Fermilab's future
</H1>
Since NOvA's goals depends on the value of theta-13, there was
sentiment within EPP2010 to wait for a value of theta-13 before 
proceeding with NOvA, but that view did not prevail.  Fermilab 
needs a physics program before the linear collider.  FNAL's future 
is guaranteed because it is in the congressional district of the 
powerful Speaker of the House of Representatives Dennis Hastert.

<P><H1>
*** Update on NOvA
</H1>
NOvA (~140 physicists, mostly US, with INFN considering support 
for 5 institutions/20 physicists) hopes to observe numu to nue,
of importance for telling us the mass hierarchy of neutrinos as 
well as possibly whether there is leptonic CP violation.  The 
experiment requires a 20-25 kTon detector located off the central 
axis of the NuMI beam, approximately 810km away (MINOS 735.4km/on-
axis).  The off-axis location, Ash River (MN) results in a narrow 
energy distribution.  Detector cost ~$200M, and it benefits from
foreseen upgrades to NuMI enabling operations at 700kW - 1.2MW
once the collider program terminates.  NOvA has had favorable
reviews from DOE, NuSAG, EPP2010, and P5.  P5 recommended a 2008 
start of construction.  The project was recommended for DOE CD1 
2/06, and will have the CD2 review  ~2/07 and CD3 (construction
start) in 10/07.  A prototype detector to be operated in the 
NuMI beam on site at Fermilab is to be completed in 2007.

*** Neutrino sculpture of a sort; from 21/22-Oct Financial Times
</H1>
Mrs. Moneypenny wrote the following:"...Last week I attended a 
private dinner held by London's Albion gallery in honor of the
Japanese multimedia and performance artist Moriko Mori...the
installation looked, from its picture, to resemble a giant
flashing condom...the dark does allow you to appreciate the 
flashing LED lighting inside the condom, which is linked, via
the internet to a computer in the Super-Kamiokande Observatory
at Tokyo University (sic).  The computer detects the presence of
neutrinos arriving from outer space; this information is 
translated by the sculpture into changing patterns of coloured
light (no, I am not making this up.)"
