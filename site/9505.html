Long Baseline Neutrino News                   May 1995

<p>
</p><h1>*** Questions to MINOS and BNL889 from Sciulli Panel </h1>
The HEPAP neutrino oscillation subpanel had 22 questions in four
sections for FNAL/MINOS/COSMOS and 22 questions in three sections
for BNL/E889.  Questions covered Beam, Monitoring and Flux; Detectors,
Discovery Potential, and (for FNAL) MINOS/COSMOS interactions.
The subpanel is meeting June 13th at Fermilab, a week later
at Brookhaven, and then they plan to hold a retreat in July.

</p><h1>*** Hazel O'Leary's mother today, her cow tomorrow </h1>
Secretary of Energy, Hazel O'Leary was quoted in the May 19th
issue of Science magazine, "Neutrinos have mass.
Great, now why does my mother care?" (last question, p966)

<p>
</p><h1>*** Cost Review subcommittee </h1>
The (Lehman) cost review of Nu-osc experiments at BNL and FNAL
consists of Daniel Lehman (chair), Roger Carlini, Lee Harwood, Lou
Keller, Otto Matherny, Gary Sanders, Steve Tkaczyk and William
Wisniewski.  And maybe Dennis Theriot.  They are divided into four
subcommittees on beam-civil; beam-technical; detector; and management.

<p>
</p><h1>*** BNL proposal </h1>
A thorough new document details the design and physics capabilities of
the BNL889 experiment.  Four identical detectors will be staged at
1km, 3km, 24km(Northville Long Island) and 68 km(Plum Island).  The
detectors will each be 1.5 degrees off the main axis of the beam.
This gives a lower energy neutrino beam without the lower flux that a
lower energy proton beam would give.  Assuming azimuthal symmetry is
maintained, this also allows the same energy spectrum for each detector,
without a high energy tail.  High energy events at BNL could provide
backgrounds to their quasi-elastic and single pizero event rates.
The detectors will be staged, but with 16 months of running all
detectors, they get 9000 events at D24 and 1000 events at D68.
Extensive beam calculations show that variation of intensity across D1
is 33%, 10% in D3 and negligible in D24 and D68.  Cosmic ray
backgrounds for CC events are found to be small.

</p><h1>*** Super-K plans </h1>
SuperKamiokande is being built.  They plan to pour the water in
January 1996 and start taking data in March or April 1996.  It
will be 50kT of water with a fiducial of 22kT(solar,pdk) or
32kT(Supernova).  It has an analysis threshold of 5 MeV and
will get solar 30 events/day (50% SSM).  As a longbaseline
detector it would see 400 cc events and nc one pizero events.
A long baseline beam could be ready from KEK in '98 or '99.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Lake Baikal </h1>
They had a mild winter, so the lake didn't freeze to 40 cm until
March, which gave a season 3 weeks shorter than usual.  They have
five partially working strings underwater, including 72 pmt's
deployed in March 1995.  Two tubes (one channel) have a 100 Hz
rate due to dark current and bioluminescence.  Their muon trigger
is &gt;3(4) channels in 500 ns.  They also search for slow monopoles.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Cern to Gran Sasso event rates </h1>
A long baseline beam from CERN to Gran Sasso could run 2 10^13 ppp
at 450 GeV with a 14.4 s cycle time, yielding 2 10^19 POT/year.
With a 1 km decay pipe, this would give 950 events/kT/year at Gran
Sasso.  MACRO could find 810 internal events/year and 1090 external
events/year with new dedicated tracking algorithm.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Gallex/SAGE future running not secure </h1>
The Homestake chlorine experiment has run 25 years.  Gallex
running after 1996 is not secure, unless they receive additional
funds to release the gallium mortgage.   Longterm running for SAGE,
in the Baksan region of Russia faces regional political troubles.

<p>
</p><h1>*** New CERN short-baseline proposal </h1>
A proposal to use a 400 ton liquid argon TPC (like ICARUS) for a
short baseline numu to nutau and numu to nue experiment in the CERN
west area at 900 m from the primary target was heard at the COGNE
meeting, which was held last week.
