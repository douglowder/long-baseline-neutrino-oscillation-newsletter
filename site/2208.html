*** Hyper-K and DUNE will compete and complement each other
</H1> <P>
At the LBNF/DUNE-US CD-1RR DOE review, a key takeaway was 
strong support for the competitiveness and complementarity of
DUNE and Hyper-K.  "...If neutrino physics is more complex than
can be parametrized in the PMNS matrix, this complementarity
will become even more invaluable."  The status of long-baseline
experiments is at

*** LBNF/DUNE and the "CHIPS and Science Act"
</H1> <P>
This bill passed in both the house and
senate.  See p 211 
<A href="https://science.house.gov/chipsandscienceact">
https://science.house.gov/chipsandscienceact
</A>
"The Secretary shall ensure that (LBNF) will provide at a minimum:
(i) A state-of-the-art 800 MeV superconducting linear accelerator,
(ii) Proton power of 1.2 MW at the start of LBNF/DUNE, upgradable
to 2.4 MW, (iii) A flexible design to enable high power beam
delivery to multiple users simultaneously and customized beams
tailored to specific scientific needs, (iv) Sustained high
reliability operation of the Fermilab accelerator complex.  The
Secretary shall, subject to the availability of appropriations,
ensure full operations of (LBNF) starts before 31-Dec-2028.

A new 2nd horn was fabricated at U of  Colorado, and has arrived
for the final assembly work.  Installation was done in July.
Installation of a beam profile monitor was done in June with
Canadian collaborators.    Upgrade work of ND280 is in progress.
Plastic scintillator cubes of the SuperFGD, a new tracking target
detector, have been shipped to J-PARC. The HATPC, a new tracking
detector surrounding the SuperFGD, showed some HV problems and a
solution is being sought.  Two Italian collaborators came to work
on the renewal of the TPC gas system.

***  JSNS2 
</H1> <P>
Experimenters at MLF searching for sterile neutrinos, are working
on the blind analysis of the 1.45x10^22 POT data taken until 
June 2021.  They resumed data taking from January 29, 2022, until
May 31, 2022.  The next step, JSNS-II, has started. A TDR
was submitted and stage-II was recommended at the JPARC PAC
meeting.  A new detector 48 m from the target, outside of the MLF 
experimental hall, is under construction.

<li> "A Gaseous Argon-Based Near Detector to Enhance the Physics
Capabilities of DUNE", 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06281"> arXiv:2203.06281, </A>
A magnetized gaseous
argon-based detector system (ND-GAr) is required for DUNE to reach
its full physics potential.
<li> "Testing neutrino flavor models", 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06219"> arXiv:2203.06219, </A>
We are
entering the precision era of neutrino physics. But the question
arises “How precise do we want to measure neutrino parameters?”.
Flavor models can provide a compelling answer to this question.
<li> "Tau Neutrinos in the Next Decade: from GeV to EeV", 

<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05591"> arXiv:2203.05591, </A>
This whitepaper, prepared as a part of the
NuTau2021 Workshop, discusses the current and expected upcoming
status of tau neutrino physics with attention to the broad
experimental and theoretical landscape spanning long-
baseline, beam-dump, collider, and astrophysical experiments.

Neutrino Physics", 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02309"> arXiv:2203.02309, </A>

chamber an also study neutrinos through neutrinoless double-beta
decay and through a variety of astrophysical sources.

to Experiment", 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12169"> arXiv:2203.12169, </A>

theoretical aspects of the neutrinoless double-beta decay program
and lays out a roadmap for future developments.
