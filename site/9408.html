</p><h1>*** Collaboration-forming Meeting August 12th (LBC)</h1>
22 institutions have expressed some interest in the long
baseline project at Fermilab.  Representatives from 12 of them
met at Fermilab on August 12th to take the first steps in
forming a collaboration to carry out the program.  A 7 member
interim steering committee was chosen, and each institution will
be invited to appoint a member to a "structural issues" group to
set up a long term structure by February 1995.  Six other
working groups were formed to study: Beam; Simulations; Site;
and three groups on Detector R&amp;D, Active elements; prototype
planning; magnets and engineering.  As yet, the collaboration
has no name or number (other than EOI's 7, 8 and 9); for now it
is called the Long Baseline Collaboration (LBC).

</p><h1>
*** Next LBC Meeting at Fermilab October 1st and 2nd</h1>
This is a Saturday/Sunday meeting.  For information, contact one
of the following members of the interim steering committee:
Maury Goodman (ANL), Doug Michael (Cal Tech), Wonyong Lee
(Columbia), Dixon Bogert (FNAL), Ken Heller (Minnesota), Peter
Litchfield (RAL), Stan Wojcicki (Stanford).

*** Fermilab Sets up Project Management Group for NuMI</h1>
The NeUtrinos at the Main Injector (NUMI) took a major step
forward with an organization plan.  Gina Rameika has been
appointed the Project Manager with the intention of the
establishment of a Project Management Group (PMG) similar to
that for the Main Injector.  A beams group will be headed by
Jorge Morfin, and a experiment group (Long Baseline and Short
Baseline) will be formed with a head to be announced.

*** San Onofre experiment funded</h1>
DOE has approved (almost) enough funds for the construction of
the San Onofre reactor neutrino oscillation experiment.  Another
French reactor neutrino oscillation experiment has been funded and is
being built at CHOOZ.  For more info: ""

</p><h1>*** Workshop at KEK</h1>
On Oct 17-19 there will be a workshop at KEK on possible
upgrades to the PS with a strong emphasis on neutrino
possibilities.  For information:

</p><h1>*** Neutrinos on Minnesota's newspapers, TV; magazine</h1>
The June Fermilab PAC report was covered in the newspaper of
Northern Minnesota, the Timberjay, on August 8th, 1994.  A
Minneapolis TV station did a 6 minute segment on Soudan in June,
mentioning the future proposal to link Soudan with "another
physics lab near Chicago".  On p331 of the July-August 1994
"American Scientist" there is a drawing of a Long-baseline
Neutrino beam.  The article, by John Huth, is "High-Energy
Physics: The Road Ahead" focusing on the SSC-less future.

<p>
</p><h1>*** E803 signs Memoranda of understanding (MOU)</h1>
In preparation for R&amp;D for the short baseline experiment, those
groups have each signed an MOU with Fermilab.   803 is studying
changes in detector layout, such as a Japanese idea to split up
the target emulsion and put chambers in between.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Fermilab neutrino beam options</h1>
Weekly meetings at Fermilab (led by Jorge Morfin) now
concentrate on beam options.  The group has agreed to focus
study on three options:  horn, dichromatic, and plasma lens.
Anthony Malensek and Frank Nezrick are working on these.  Other
ideas will be considered if someone will work on them.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Fermilab NuMI Jargon</h1>
There are a number of milestones ahead for the Fermilab neutrino
program, and bureaucratic jargon will be involved.  It includes:
PMG -- Project Management Group, mostly Fermilab Department
leaders
NEPA (National Environmental Protection Act)
EE560- Form for NEPA to determine if we need an environmental
assessment (hard) or an environmental impact statement (harder)
EA -- Environmental Assessment which we guess needs to be done
FONSI -- Finding of No Significant Impact; our goal for the EA
PSAD -- Preliminary Safety Assessment Document

</p><h1>*** Harry Bingham</h1>
We're sad to report the death of Berkeley physicist Harry
Bingham.  He had expressed interest in long baseline neutrinos.
