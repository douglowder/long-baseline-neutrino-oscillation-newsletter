Long-Baseline Neutrino News                   July 1998

*** Super-Kamiokande solar data may be "just-so"
</h1>With 504 days and 6.5 MeV threshold, their flux is .474 of
the BP98 calculation for solar neutrinos.  Looking for an energy
distortion, the 3 bins above 13 MeV are high with large errors.
This is suggestive of the "just-so" solar neutrino solution,
vacuum neutrino oscillations with L_osc near 1-AU.  No day/night
effect is seen, particular in the "Night-5" bin which goes
through the core.  The seasonal data is consistent with 1/R^2
from the sun.   The best "just-so" fit gives dmsq = 4.2 10^-10
and sin^2 2q = 0.93, but there is poor overlap with the regions
from Hata/Langacker '98.  "can't say anything conclusive".
Nus from 5.0 to 6.5 MeV are also now seen with larger backgrounds.

*** Soudan 2 "high-resolution" nu data has good L/E resolution
</h1>At Vancouver, Hugh Gallagher reported on a new analysis
of 3.9 kt-year data from Soudan 2 using events with good
angular resolution.  These are the low energy events with
recoil nucleons, high energy quasi-elastic events, and
multiprongs.  R is reported to be .64 +- .11 +- .06.  With
the high resolution sample, R = .52 and L/E plots were shown.
Values of delta-msquared above 10^-3 are favored.

*** Super-Kamiokande atmospheric data highlight of ICHEP
</h1>Their "evidence" paper is available at
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-ex/9807003">
hep-ex/9807003.</a>

*** The Richter scale shakes neutrinos at Vancouver ICHEP
</h1>Last month the Richter scale was mentioned for SNO in Ontario.
In Vancouver Canada, nu's dominated ICHEP98.  Following an
excellent neutrino review by Janet Conrad, (after the speaker
had been applauded and her microphone turned off), session chair
Burt Richter made a skeptical remark about the use of 90% C.L.'s
by neutrino physicists.   About 20 of the 800 there applauded
him.  The rest of us were a bit confused, because taken
literally, he implied one should never quote a 1-sigma error.

*** Neutrino Acronyms
</h1>A June 16th article and cartoon in the New York Times noted the
confusing array of acronyms at Neutrino '98.  (A remark in the
article criticizing young speakers has been alleged to be a
misquotation.)  Anyone who is confused by nu acronyms can turn to
the "Neutrino Acronyms" page found at the Neutrino Oscillation
Industry Website.

*** Arsenic is good for GALLEX's health
</h1>An Arsenic 71 exposure of Gallex was performed to test the
chemistry response with dilutions at the 10-26 level to 1% in
efficiency of extraction.  They got perfect agreement, measuring
.998+-.008 of the expected value, averaged over a variety of
conditions.   They measure 77.5 +-8 SNU; 60 +-7% of models.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Heat data heats up neutrino flux confusion
</h1>A new measurement of atmospheric muons suggests that the
solar-min neutrino flux should be 30-50% lower.  The energy
distributions are in excellent agreement with the TARGET code,
used for the Bartol flux.  One possibility is that too high a
primary proton flux was used in the calculation.

*** Embargo limits Soudan 2 equipment.  Will MINOS be affected?
</h1>Soudan 2 received the following concerning a radon detector,
"Thank you for your interest in Pylon Electronics products
Your message was forwarded to us for action since AMALE is export
management company of Pylon in the Middle East and North Africa
including Sudan.  I regret to tell you that currently due to
embargo we are not allowed to ship any equipment to Sudan.
However we have all items you need available, and will be glad to
supply you with it in the future, when situation in Sudan will
change for the best. Thank you, Best regards, O.G.-Sales Engineer"

If solar

oscillations scales then there exists a unique 3x3 mixing matrix.
The solution necessarily conserves CP.  For non-maximal mixing
nue to nutau and nue to numu oscillations are predicted that may
be observable in future long-baseline experiments.  (June 98)
