<BODY> <H1>Long-Baseline neutrino not-news, 1930-2018 </H1> <P> *** *** 
Long-Baseline Neutrino Olds 1930-2018 or "Long-Baseline neutrino not-news" 
based on Neutrino History

<H1> *** No August 2018 Issue </H1> <P> Long-Baseline Neutrino News has 
been sent out monthly since 1992, but due to a three week vacation and 
attendance at the Neutrino History Conference, August was missed.  To make 
up for it, there will be two issues this month - this one devoted to 
history, and another one in a few days to cover August and September.

<H1> *** History of Neutrino Conference </H1> <P> The purpose of the 
Conference was to cover the main steps of their history since the 
brilliant and inspired idea of Pauli in December 1930. Though trying to 
cover all the facets of this fascinating particle, it should be considered 
as a contribution to the History of the Neutrino, since some chapters are 
still to be written. Most speakers described the historical context for 
neutrino discoveries and there was a little bit of Gedanken history, 
though many could not help themselves and talked about what they are doing 
now.  The videos of most speakers will be available & slides are found at

<H1> *** First use of "nu" rather than "n" for neutrino </H1> <P> Pauli 
had called his idea the neutron, but after the particle we now know as the 
neutron was discovered, Amaldi was first to use the term "neutrino" in a 
conversation with Fermi.  Fermi made the name popular, and is often 
credited with the name.  But in early papers, the neutrino was still 
called "n".  The first recorded use of the Greek letter "nu" for neutrino 
was found by P. Ramond being used by E.M. Lyman in 1938.

<H1> *** First Underground Experiment? </H1> <P> Surely the first 
underground neutrino experiment was performed by Maurice Nahmias, a 
student of Chadwick, searching for the neutrino at the Holborn Tube 
Underground Station in London. The result?  Neutrinos could pass through 
at least 31,000 km of air before they hit anything.  One user of London's 
subway system commented, "If I was a neutrino, I wouldn't stop there 
either."

<H1> *** Examples of "nu" at neutrino history banquet </H1> <P> In French, 
nu means naked.  The conference banquet was held at the Musee D'Orsay, 
where nudes from some artists are on display, along with other great art 
from Monet, Cezanne, Degas, Tissot...

<H1> *** Nobel prize for Madame Wu? </H1> <P> The Nobel Prize in Physics 
1957 was awarded jointly to Chen Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao (T.D.) Lee "for 
their penetrating investigation of the so-called parity laws which has led 
to important discoveries regarding the elementary particles."  A strong 
case could be made that Madame Wu should have been included, and she is 
widely given credit for the experimental discovery of parity violation in 
Cobalt.  Nobel prize discussions are kept secret for at least 50 years.  
But since Lee and Yang are both still alive, it is likely that new light 
on this decision won't come soon.

<H1> *** Neutrino pre-history </H1> <P> A fascinating talk by Allan 
Franklin looked at the history of acceptance of the continuous beta 
spectrum, for which the neutrino was the solution.  Chadwick wrote 
Rutherford in 1914, "...I can't even find the ghost of a line.  There is 
probably a silly mistake somewhere."  It was Ellis and Wooster who showed 
that the heating from beta decay was within 15 percent of that reflected 
from the mean beta decay energy, and not associated with the max, as it 
would be if the energy of every disintegration was the same, and the 
problem became finding the missing energy.  Meitner had doubted this 
result, but wrote to Ellis in 1930 "We have verified your results 
completely. It seems to me now that there can be absolutely no doubt that 
you were completely correct in assuming that beta radiations are primarily 
inhomogeneous. But I do not understand this result at all.”

<H1> *** Neutrino mistakes </H1> <P> We learn from our mistakes so a talk 
on neutrino mistakes was included in the agenda.  Discussions included the 
17 keV neutrino and a claimed observation of neutrinoless double beta 
decay, but there was wide disagreement on the attention that our field got 
as a result of the possible observation of superluminal neutrinos. Some 
felt that it hurt our credibility and that of science in general.  But 
also expressed was the point that it was first time friends and family 
cared about their work.  Neutrinos don't care what you say about them as 
long as you spell their name right.

<H1> *** Pauli's letter </H1> <P> His famous letter was sent to Lisa 
Meitner for the 1930 meeting in Tubingen.  Most people liked the idea, but 
some exceptions were Bohr, Sommerfeld and Eddington.  (Pauli himself 
considered it "desperate".)  The letter includes: "But only the one who 
dare can win and the difficult situation, due to the continuous structure 
of the beta spectrum, is lighted by a remark of my honoured predecessor, 
Mr Debye, who told me recently in Bruxelles: "Oh, It's well better not to 
think about this at all, like new taxes". From now on, every solution to 
the issue must be discussed."
