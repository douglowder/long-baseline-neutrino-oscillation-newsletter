*** Of Neutrinos and elephants
</h1> <p>
Plans for the INO experiment in Tamil Nadu India continue to be
held up by the State Government, due to concerns about nearby
elephants.  The environment minister Jiram Ramesh has recently
backed the project.  See, "The elephant and the neutrino" from

*** NuMI running antineutrinos for MINOS
</h1> <p>
After running for several years using neutrinos, the MINOS
experiment has switched to running antineutrinos.  This involved
switching the polarity on the horn, and on the toroid magnets
of the near and far detectors, to focus negative pions and kaons
coming from the target rather than positive ones.  There are less
negative particles than positive ones, and the antineutrinos have
a smaller cross section (by about two), so getting statistics is
harder, but MINOS will be able to accurately check whether
neutrino oscillation parameters are the same for neutrinos and
antineutrinos.  It will also help understand other beam issues.

*** Alternating Neutral Currents (III)
</h1> <p>
An electrical engineer tells me that Alternating Neutral Current
is an appropriate description for power.  The reason that neutral
current is important in power distribution systems is mainly due
to safety.  If the neutral current doesn't equal the line current
in a circuit, then that means that the difference must be flowing
somewhere else, most often through ground, but potentially through
someone who touches the wrong thing.  This is the principle behind
ground fault interrupters.  They measure both line and neutral
currents, and trip the circuit if there is a difference.

*** The date of Neutrino Day; moved from February
</h1> <p>
Previously celebrated in February, this year Lead South Dakota
celebrated Neutrino Day in July.

***  The date &amp; name of the April APS meeting; moved to February
</h1> <p>
The name of the APS meeting formerly known as the Washington
meeting was changed to the April meeting since it isn't always in
DC.  Next year the April meeting is in Washington in February.
(The APS couldn't change its name from Physical to Physics in '05)

***  The Name of LBNE
</h1> <p>
A long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment could be the
anchor for DUSEL, and it had a collaboration meeting coming up
in Lead SD in October.  DOE's project name is LBNE (Long-Baseline
Neutrino Experiment) but the collaboration wants something better:

*** DUSEL, a gold mine that can't mine gold
</h1> <p>
The Sanford Lab is a South Dakota initiative while DUSEL is an NSF
project (which will merge).  DUSEL will complete preliminary
design in Dec 10, present to the National Science Board in Spring
'11, and start construction in FY13.  In parallel, South Dakota is
preparing the site.  But they can't mine gold, if they find it, as
part of the agreement when Barrick gave them the mine.  Although
like Japanese whaling, it can be done for scientific purposes.

*** 4th Project X Workshop in 9-10 Nov; ICD-2
</h1> <p>
This Meeting will focus on a key element of Fermilab's future.

The initial baseline design (ICD-1) of the Project-X accelerator
complex can generate and handle the beam power required for the
long-baseline neutrino program, however the high beam power
available at 8 GeV is not readily usable by the rare-decay
experiments. Further, the auxiliary accelerator concepts developed
to handle and condition 8 GeV beam power for near-term muon
experiments does not scale well with increasing beam power and
precludes the use of the Debuncher and Accumulator for the anti-p
research program.  The challenge presented by the ICD-1 in serving
the long-baseline neutrino program and rare-decay program has
motivated consideration of the ICD-2 alternative design. The ICD-2
is based on a 2 GeV Continuous Wave (CW) linac, and its impact on
the Project-X research program is the subject of a report found at:

*** The Date on long-baseline news; Yes this is for September
</h1> <p>
Unlike magazines, I report the news for the month, so each issue
comes out at the beginning of the next month...unless I'm late.
