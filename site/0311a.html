*** APS Neutrino Workshop Study Sat/Sun December 13-14 in Chicago
</h1>
The APS Divisions of Particles and Fields and of Nuclear Physics,
together with the APS Divisions of Astrophysics and the Physics of
Beams, are sponsoring a year-long Study on the Physics of Neutrinos.
The overarching purpose of the study is for a diverse community of
scientists to examine the broad sweep of neutrino physics, and if
possible, to move towards agreement on the next steps towards answering
the questions that drive the field.  The study will lay scientific
groundwork for the choices that must be made during the next few years.

A public initial meeting of the study will be held at Argonne on
Sat/Sun 13-14 Dec. The study leaders are Stuart Freedman from
UC-Berkeley and Boris Kayser from Fermilab. An organizing committee has
been assembled. Working group leaders are being chosen, and will
organize their groups during the workshop.  The planned working groups
include:

-&gt;Solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments
-&gt;Reactor neutrino experiments
-&gt;Superbeam experiments and development
-&gt;Neutrino factory and beta beam experiments and development
-&gt;Neutrinoless double beta decay and direct searches for nu mass
-&gt;What cosmology/astrophysics and nu physics can teach each other

Each working group will include both experimentalists and theorists. In
view of the many relations between the topics of the different groups,
there will be considerable cross-talk between them. In addition, the
theorists will be asked to consider how neutrino properties to be
measured can teach us about the physics underlying neutrino mass and
discriminate among models, and to consider the relation between
neutrino behavior that can be observed today and
leptogenesis/baryogenesis in the early universe.

*** Neutrino Physicist participation at Workshop Invited
</h1>
The workshop will start Saturday morning with a meeting of the study
organizers.  Saturday afternoon/evening and all day Sunday the goals of
the study will be discussed in a meeting to which the entire neutrino
community is invited.  This discussion of goals will include the
organizing of the individual working groups on Sunday. Further details
concerning this first meeting of the study, including details on access
to Argonne, will be distributed very shortly.  <br>
See <a href="http://www.neutrinooscillation.org/studyaps/">

The working groups will meet as necessary during the year, with the
goal of completing their work in time for a final meeting of the study
in late May or early June.

*** Neutrinos in 20 years Facilities Plan
</h1>
The long awaited US Office of Science facilities plan was
released by DOE Secretary Abraham at the National Press Club
luncheon covered by CSPAN.  The report is available at
<a href="http://www.sc.doe.gov/Sub/Facilities_for_future/20-Year-Outlook-screen.pdf">
http://www.sc.doe.gov/Sub/Facilities_for_future/20-Year-Outlook-screen.pdf
</a>
A double beta decay underground detector was ranked as a mid-term
priority, 18th overall.  A Super-neutrino beam (i.e. proton
driver) was ranked as a far-term priority, 21st overall.  Not
included on the list, but under consideration, had been an
off-axis experiment, a large proton decay detector, and a
neutrino factory.  A liquid xenon double-beta detector had been
submitted as well and could be chosen.  Programatically,
the off-axis experiment can reasonably be linked to the superbeam,
though the facilities plan was made, in part, to fit budgets.

<p> </p><h1>
*** What the facilities plan means
</h1>
This is a matter of great discussion and speculation.  Secretary
Abraham made clear that we need to be flexible in the future, but
he also emphasized rather strongly that these were the priorities
and that changing them could not and would not be done lightly.
