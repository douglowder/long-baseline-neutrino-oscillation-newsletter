*** Snowmass Workshop on Physics Opportunities at Nu Experiments
</H1> <P>
<A href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/1103445/">
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1103445/

It will be online 10-12 Feb.
2022, hosted by the Pittsburgh Particle Physics, Astrophysics, and
Cosmology Center.  The registration deadline is 4 Feb.  Also,
please fill out a survey on the neutrino community attendance at
the Snowmass community summer study 17-26 July in Seattle:

*** FASER sees first neutrinos at the LHC in emulsion
</H1> <P>
Collider experiments make less nus than fixed target experiments,
but some are higher energy.  A goal of CERN's FASER is to measure
some of these TeV nus.  As reported in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06197"> arXiv:2105.06197, </A>
 this
detector using emulsions 480 m forward of the ATLAS experiment
reported 6.1 (11.9) signal (mu background) nu interactions.

*** Panofsky prizes to Lundberg, Niwa, Rameika and Paolone for emulsion
</H1> <P>
The 2022 APS Panofsky prize was awarded to 4 recipients, "for the
first direct observation of the tau neutrino through its charged-
current interactions in an emulsion detector," including FNAL's
Byron Lundberg, Nagoya's Kimio Niwa, & Pittsburgh's Vittorio
Paolone and Fermilab's Gina Rameika.

*** 2-gamma decay probes 0nu2beta decay nuclear matrix elements
</H1> <P>
There is uncertainty in predicted neutrinoless double-beta decay
rates from matrix elements, and measurements from 2-nu decay does
not pin it down.  Future 2-gamma measurements might help.

*** Neutrino physicist explains opera
</H1> <P>
Tokio Ohska designed the electronics for an FNAL experiment which
measured neutrino neutral current structure functions.  But he
also teaches opera classes and here discusses Verdi's La Traviata:

*** And a reminder about OPERA
</H1> <P>
The Oscillation Project with Emulsion-tRacking Apparatus (OPERA)
was a scientific experiment that detected 10 nutaus from numu
oscillations.  In 2018 they made their data public.

*** What would you do if you had $100M
</H1> <P>
At an SBND theory workshop at Fermilab, three theorists ranked 13
physics motivations, thinking about how they would divide up a
hundred million dollars.  The winner was the pseudo-scalar dark
sector.  No real money was spent in making slide 41 of

*** James Webb Space Telescope overcomes >300 potential failures
</H1> <P>
After a successful launch, the telescope deployed is primary
mirror, after testing, more testing, and even more testing a
process with >300 single points of failure.  We'll learn some
more about nu mass.

*** Uninteresting letters of Interest from >300 LOIs
</H1> <P>
A keen observer will be able to ascertain that there were no
uninteresting letters of Interest submitted to Snowmass involving
neutrinos.  We've mentioned 80 of the more than 300.  The deadline
for "white paper" contributions to Snowmass is 15 March 2022, but
so far only 3 have been submitted.  We will soon switch from
reviewing LOIs to reviewing neutrino white papers, which will be
found at
