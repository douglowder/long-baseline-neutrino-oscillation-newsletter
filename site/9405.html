</head><body><h1>Long Baseline / P822 news,  May 1994</h1>
<p>
</p><h1>Snowmass schedule</h1>
Reminder that Long Baseline neutrino oscillations will be
discussed July 8-12th at Snowmass.  I have made a separate
email list for those who are/might be coming, (and have told
me.)  Let me know if you want to be added to that list.
There will also be discussions of Atmospheric neutrinos
on July 1-5 and short baseline on July 5-9th.
<p>
</p><h1>BNL/FNAL comparison delayed ????</h1>
At the Argonne High Energy Physics Division review, John
O'fallon opined that a Fermilab/BNL Long Baseline comparison,
originally thought to be late summer or early fall, might not
happen since there is no prospect for funding next year.  At the
ZGS reunion he reviewed the past and future of HEP labs, and
about BNL he said, "Whether or not there will be High Energy
Physics done on RHIC remains to be seen".
<p>
</p><h1>Fermilab EOI's (3 of them)</h1>
On May 16th, 3 EOI's for Long Baseline were submitted to
Fermilab.   The 822 collaboration submitted a proposal for a 16
kT iron calorimeter at Soudan.  Stan Wojicki discusses a water
or iron detector at SLAC, BNL or TRIUMF.  The Genius-USA group,
including many MACRO and IMB collaborators, discusses a 17 kT
magnetized iron calorimeter at Fairport Harber (IMB) or Soudan.
<p>
</p><h1>Gran Sasso EOI (2 of them)</h1>
Much of the 822 collaboration has joined the Genius group
(contact persons Barry Barish and Doug Michael) expressing
interest for a Long Baseline Neutrino Oscillation detector at
LNGS for use from CERN.  The EOI was presented by Doug Michael
at a Gran Sasso meeting May 20th.  Carlo Rubbia presented ICARUS
and locked out any possibility Borexino could coexist.  He gave
cost estimates to the committee but made them confidential.
<p>
</p><h1>DUMAND progress, but slow ahead</h1>
Much of DUMAND was deployed in 12/93 (cable, transponders,one
string,...) but there was a leak in the string after 10 hours.
It's been removed and fixed but is now waiting with two other
strings for funds from contract renewal.  During 2 minutes live
time they got one barn burner multimuon and low 50kcs noise.
<p>
</p><h1>803 worried about long delays</h1>
"Tying E803 to P822 is like putting a ten-ton anchor on a
speedboat".  Note to FNAL from Deputy spokesman Rudi Thun.  The
803 collaboration is worried that a combined short-/long-
baseline experiment would not get built in time to be
competitive with a 3rd (?) run of CHORUS.  They have stated
a goal of starting to run by 1999, which they see as only
possible in the neutrino area.   The would hope to use AIP
(Accelerator Improvement) funds to bring out the beam, and avoid
a line item.  The cost and schedule of this plan is unknown,
a big obstacle being Main Injector beam from F0 to switchyard.
This plan would hinder if not destroy the long baseline part
of the program, though this is debatable as well.
<p>
</p><h1>Another threat to NuMI from collider upgrades; maybe not.</h1>
In response to the SSC demise, a number of Fermilab upgrades are
being considered which raise the energy and intensity for high
energy high pt collider research.  One idea involves a major
p-bar upgrade with a new tunnel in the Main Injector.  Such a
running scheme might use all Main Injector protons, leaving p's
for 120 fixed target only during Tevatron fixed target running.
John Peoples, though, says there is no threat to NuMI.
<p>
</p><h1>822 getting good publicity</h1>
At the ZGS reunion, Malcom Derrick showed the 822 beam and
potential.  At a talk at Cornell honoring Bob Wilson, Leon
Lederman also showed the 822 beam.  At the Fermilab user's
meeting next month, it will be covered by Donna Naples.
<p>
</p><h1>This is a rumor sheet</h1>
Long Baseline news contains wise cracks, rumors, rumors of
rumors, opinions, etc.  I will be happy to pass on any
references, most of which I have.  The mailing list, presently
about 160 names, will be made available for nu meeting notices.
(Three of you complained about my wise crack on tachyons.)
<p>
</p><h1>bitnet --&gt; internet</h1>
Starting with the June issue (sent around July 1st) I will try
to change all obvious bitnet addresses which I have to internet
addresses, as bitnet nodes seem to be disappearing.  If this
came to you by bitnet, please send me your preferred internet
address.   Thanks.
