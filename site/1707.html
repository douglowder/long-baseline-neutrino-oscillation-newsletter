*** Next Step for Hyper-Kamiokande; MEXT large project list
</h1> <p>
Hyper-K is one of seven projects in the MEXT large project list
<a href="http://www.mext.go.jp/b_menu/shingi/gijyutu/gijyutu4/toushin/__icsFiles/afieldfile/2017/07/31/1388523_001_1_1.pdf">

</a>
MEXT is the Japanese science ministry, and this implies that
Hyper-Kamiokande will be presented to the government to be
included in the budget.

A ceremonial groundbreaking for the International LBNF/DUNE
project took place in July at the Sanford Underground Research
Facility.  The ceremony at the 4850 level included 2 senators, 2
representatives, a White House representative, a governor and
scientists.  They overturned a few shovels of dirt, but there are
800,000 tons of rock to go.

*** Next Step on WA105; first particle tracks
</h1> <p>
Work is progressing on a dual-phase liquid Argon prototype at
CERN, also known as WA105 and protoDUNE-DP.  While an 11 m^3
detector is under construction, a 3x1x1 m^3 detector was made in
2016 and is being commissioned as part of the CERN neutrino
platform.  Two cosmic ray tagger panels have a 0.3 Bq rate. The
cathode and field cage were powered to 50 kV. After 7 volumes of
recirculation, good liquid Ar purity and long ms drift were
achieved.  On June 20, the first track was seen.

*** Next Step for SBND; measuring booster neutrinos
</h1> <p>
A test installation of panels for the SBND Cosmic Ray Tracker has
been completed in a way to see crossing particles generated by
Booster Beam nus.  The timing distribution clearly measures 1.6us
spill of the Booster, as well as the 53 MHz proton structure.

*** Next Step for ICARUS; arrival at Fermilab
</h1> <p>
The six week trip ended 26 July as ICARUS arrived at Fermilab where
it will be part of the Short-Baseline Neutrino Program.

Data taking is expected to start in Fall 2018 contingent to
DOE funding.

*** First measurement of coherent nu elastic scattering
</h1> <p>
The signature of neutrino nucleus elastic scattering is a keV
level nuclear recoil, a difficult process to measure.  At the Oak
Ridge Spallation neutron source, there is a high flux of decay-
at-rest neutrinos.  In order to measure this heretofore unmeasured
process, the COHERENT collaboration installed a 14.6 kg CsI
scintillator.  The exposure was 153.5 live-days beam off and 308
beam on.  Clear signals are seen in the energy and arrival time
distributions matching expectation, with a 6.7 sigma excess.

*** T2K updates electron neutrino appearance results
</h1> <p>
With 7.5e20 pot (nu) and 7.5e20 pot (anti-nu), they get 37 events
of nue appearance, 4 in antinue appearance.  This strengthens
hints for non-zero leptonic CP-violation from before.  The 90% CL
region for delta is -2.95 to -0.44 (NO) and -1.47 to -1.27 (IO).
The central 68% CL for dmsq32 is 2.54 (2.58)+-0.08 NO(IO)e-3 eV^2
and sin^2(q23) = .55+0.05-0.09.  See details in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.1048"> arXiv:1707.1048 </a>.

*** Do neutrinos really exist?
</h1> <p>
Many of us get letters and emails from well-meaning individuals who
have invented a theory of the universe, usually by taking some word
that is used in science and giving it a different meaning, together
with questionable logic.  Since 1999, I have kept a folder which now
has 294 emails.  Although the authors don't respect science, they
seek vindication from scientists.  See one such neutrino-related
endeavor at

*** Fermilab receives neutrino donation (The Onion)
</h1> <p>
<a href="http://www.theonion.com/article/fermilab-receives-generous-anonymous-particle-dona-56461">

</a>
"We will be able to use this considerable bequest of particles for
a multitude of projects that would not have been possible
otherwise," said Fermilab director Nigel Lockyer, explaining that
the donor did not wish to be named and stipulated only that each
of the particles be used in order to further scientific research.
"Donations such as this are crucial for us. Particles are never
easy to come by, and with the cuts to federal support currently
under consideration, we need all the particles we can get."
