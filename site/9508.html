</p><h1>*** HEPAP subpanel report due soon</h1>
In a short letter to proponents, the HEPAP subpanel made 4
points: 1.  Oscillations searches should form an important
segment of US-HEP, 2. MINOS should be supported; BNL-889
should not be supported, 3.  COSMOS should be supported,
4.  FNAL should remain flexible.  They said not recommending
the BNL program was "heart-wrenching".  Their full report was
mostly written in July, but a few i's are being dotted at the
DOE.  It will be out soon to HEPAP for 9/18 meeting.

</p><h1>*** Some minor subscription changes;  </h1>
This newsletter has almost 400 subscribers, so next month, it is
switching from a distribution list to a mail server.  Most of you
already received a message from the Fermilab mail server.  I will
be switching most DECNET addresses to Internet.  If you receive
this by BITNET, please send me an internet address.  If you don't
want to get Longbaseline News, tell me; you'll be removed from
the list.   If you prefer to read the newsletter on WWW, I will
start a list with just a one line message each month stating only
that the new page is available on the Web.  Let me know if you
would prefer to be on this short-message list.

</p><h1>*** Gran Sasso /ICARUS</h1>
The Gran Sasso has approved funding for two new halls.  This will
alleviate the problem that ICARUS and Borexino both wanted the
same hall.  ICARUS now plans 600 ton modules (previous plan was
5000) and is building the first one for installation in 2-3 years.
It is being constructed by industry, outside Gran Sasso.

</p><h1>*** SAGE/Gallex</h1>
The latest result from Gallex is 77.1 SNU +- 8.5 +4.4-5.4.
SAGE now gets 69 +-10 +5-7 SNU with 28 runs with the K peak
only (They had published 73).  They may present 40 runs (K&amp;L) at
Taup95.  A source was inserted in SAGE 12/26/94, they expect 92
events.  Extractions were Jan-May 95, and they will count till
November.  Some results may be ready at TAUP, but so far things
are "about right".   The source was prepared at a breeder reactor
in Kazakhstan, but was held by a Russian customs official who
required additional signatures regarding its disposal.  15% of
the source strength was lost as a result.

</p><h1>*** Winter in Beijing in Summer</h1>
At the mis-named Lepton Photon symposium, there were
8 bad talks on hadrons/QCD
and one good talk on neutrinos by CHORUS spokesman Klaus Winter.
He reviewed Oscillations.  One graph listed 6 "detections" of nu
mass.  (ITEP, Steckler, Simpson, Atmo, Solar, LSND).  He well
described the LSND result (though Bob March wasn't listening) and
touched on atmospheric neutrinos.  He was fairly negative about
both results.   He felt the solar neutrino deficit was good.  He
suggested that long baseline experiments motivated by the
atmospheric anomaly should set an independent aim.

</p><h1>*** Japan Hadron Project</h1>
KEK is planning the construction of a 50 GeV accelerator to
increase the capabilities of its KEK to Superkamiokande long
baseline experiment.  If this is the same thing as the
Japan Hadron Project (listed but not described at LP95), it
would be online by 2003.

</p><h1>*** Omega-nu between .1 and .2;  Implies 2-4 eV neutrino</h1>
Recent results on cold+hot dark matter models put an upper
limit on the contribution of hot dark matter at Omega-nu ~ 0.2.
Larger values give too little structure at high redshift.
m_nu = 93eV * h^2 * Omega-nu.  The 93 is probably known to 1%,
but h is known poorly(.5 to 1. for H=50 or 100) and Omega-nu
less well.  A paper below by C.P. Ma (Cal.Tech.) describes
the calculations.

</p><h1>*** Neutrino '96 planning underway; Also Nu telescope '96</h1>
Neutrino '96 will be in Helsinki June 13-19, 1996.  The email
address is .  Chairman of org. comm. is
Matts Roos at .  They have a page on the
World Wide Web available at http://blues.helsinki.fi/~neutri96/
A Nu-telescope workshop in Zeuthen may be just before or after
Nu '96.  For info, contact Christian Spiering ().

of m(nue)^2 from the beta-spectrum shape analysis."  They suggest
the CIAE (Chinese Institute of Atomic Energy) data used an
inaccurate formula, and that the choice of molecular model
affects the negativeness of the fit; from -237+-75 to -9+-75.
