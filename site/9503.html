</p><h1>*** Brookhaven Neutrino Experiment</h1>
Milind Diwan and Rich Helmer are now cospokespersons for E889 in
addition to Al Mann.  The proposed detector is four identical 4.6 kT
tanks at 1.5, 3, 24 (Northville)  and 68 km (Plum Island) from the
target.  Ultimately 10^21 POT are requested.  For numu disappearance
(to nutau) they could set a limit of 2.5 10^-3 eV^2 at maximal mixing,
and .075 in mixing angle at 2 10^-2 eV^2.  For numu to nue; 10^-3 eV^2
at maximal mixing and .008 at 2 10^-2 eV^2.  These assume all detectors
and 16 months running after completion (March 2000), though significant
partial running occurs before that.  Base cost estimate is $48.6M (FY96)
spread through FY97-99.  Adding overhead ($13M, due to recent changes in
DOE orders relating to construction projects), contingency ($9.1M) and
escalation ($5.3M) the total project cost estimate is $75.9M.

</p><h1>*** Breaking the bank without Long Baseline</h1>
The rumor that Tufts Soudan/MINOS graduate student William Leeson is
2nd cousin to Barings Bank (former) employee Nicholas William Leeson
is correct.  The rumor that the atmospheric neutrino deficit is related
to derivatives or otherwise losing events on the Singapore, Tokyo or
any other futures market is incorrect.

</p><h1>*** LSND preprint coming;  tank tops in style</h1>
The LSND preprint relating to their evidence for nu oscillations has
been delayed in order to give a careful study of backgrounds.  Although
each contribution to background is small, the number of potential
backgrounds is large, and LSND realizes that a complete discussion is
needed in their paper.   In response to concerns about the NYTimes
article, Los Alamos director S. Hecker wrote other lab directors about
plans for a PRLetter and a longer document at the end of March.  (Now
the target is tax day, April 17th.)  Meanwhile, one analysis finds that
if events in the bottom half of the detector are discarded, and cuts are
used rather than a likelihood ratio, there is no oscillation signal.
Backgrounds in the bottom half of the detector may be higher (the veto
shield is on the sides and top), but the signal may be higher as well
(due to phototube gain variations).

</p><h1>*** UK funding request</h1>
Jenny Thomas presented the MINOS experiment to the PPESP (Particle Physics
Experiment Selection Panel) on March 20th.  She covered the physics
case for the long baseline experiment, as well as the UK groups' (Oxford,
Rutherford, Sussex) funding request (2M pounds).  One recurring question
was whether Soudan 2 by itself would be just as adequate but cheaper.
Reportedly, the PPESP is very enthusiastic on the physics and  keen for
UK participation, but there is a money problem.  The PPC (Particle
Physics Committee) may meet soon and offer a smaller figure, which the
collaboration would respond to at the PPESP meeting of 10th July.

</p><h1>*** CERN meeting March 1st; Gran Sasso meeting March 23/24</h1>
European interest in Long Baseline at CERN is growing, and two meetings
were held in March on the subject.  Gran Sasso Director Monicelli is
enthusiastic about an experiment there.  Two new Gran Sasso Halls have
been funded, as they look at new potential solar neutrino, double-beta
decay, dark matter and long baseline experiments.    CERN has
allegedly told Gran Sasso that some contribution to the beam line would
be required for it to build a beam to Gran Sasso.  The SPS to LHC transfer
line has been redesigned with warm magnets (not superconducting), and as
a result it will not point towards Gran Sasso anymore.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Several CERN to GRAN Sasso targets considered</h1>
The only firm EOI remains ICARUS, but there were also plans presented by
B. Barish on upgrading MACRO with some chambers on the side.   A RICH
detector (Ypsilantis) 50 m long, 2m diameter with 400 tons of Argon would
give a p resolution 1%.  To increase mass, a 3 kT water detector could be
put in front.  A near detector of 10 x 12^2 m was considered.  Another
scintillating fiber detector (Barbarino) would be 4 kT of iron ore (13 cm)
with planes of fibers and 16,000 tubes, followed by 1 kT mu detector.
The civil construction of the beam is estimated at $35M (no near detector).

</p><h1>*** Dave Ayres MINOS Deputy Spokesman</h1>
Dave Ayres (Argonne) has been appointed Deputy Spokesperson for the MINOS
experiment, and also Acting Project Manager.  At a Soudan collaboration
meeting banquet, he was awarded a book on Minoan culture and archaeology.

<p>
</p><h1>*** HEPAP subpanel on neutrino oscillations</h1>
The HEPAP subpanel heard about LSND and atmospheric neutrinos at its
meeting March 23rd in Bethesda Md.  They specifically requested summaries
from BNL889 and MINOS, but not from the short baseline experiment, E803.
They will visit Fermilab June 13-15 and Brookhaven right after that.

<p>
</p><h1>*** Soudan 2 over Monte Carlo Hump;  Flavor Ratio coming soon?!?!</h1>
A logjam in the Soudan 2 atmospheric neutrino analysis has been broken
with the completed development of the revised Monte Carlo.  We now have
2.2 kT-yr of fiducial exposure, but only preliminary results from 1.0
Kt-yr of data, and statistically limited Monte Carlo.  Two independent
teams are now analyzing (blind) a mixture of 0.5 kT-yr of new data and
Monte Carlo neutrino events.  The goal is a flavor ratio from new data
and revised Monte Carlo by summer meetings, with better systematics.
