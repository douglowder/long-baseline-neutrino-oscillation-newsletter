</p><h1>
*** Cern neutrino workshop 1-3 October 2009
</h1> <p>
The aims are to begin the process of establishing a European road
map, examine techniques to improve precision, devise R&amp;D plan for
decisions by 2013, bring to light synergies between nus and other
areas, consider CERN's role, &amp; to establish procedures for Europe
coordination.  Registration deadline is 25 Sep.  The deadline for
abstracts (send to ) is 14 Sep.

*** The Perfect Neutrino Conference
</h1> <p>
The Local Organizing Committee of NuFACT09 decided to allow a
free afternoon for participants rather than plan an excursion.
High on the list of suggested activities was to attend a White
Sox (baseball) game, 3 blocks from the IIT conference site.  The
many participants who went saw the 18th ever perfect game (by
Mark Buerhle)
<a href="http://whitesox.mlb.com/mlb/news/buehrle_perfectgame/">
http://whitesox.mlb.com/mlb/news/buehrle_perfectgame/ </a>
in the history of baseball.   One European told me, "They only
told us this was an exciting game in the 9th inning.  They should
have told us in the 6th inning."  The fireworks momentarily
disrupted the SPC/LOC/Convener meeting where suggestions for
NuFACT10 were being discussed.  That will be at TIFR in Mumbai
India in late August 2010, where cricket is never perfect.

*** More meetings
</h1> <p>
I've been told there are too many neutrino meetings.  Maybe there
are just too few neutrino physicists.  Additions to the neutrino
meetings page include:
IDS-NF plenary meeting 12-14 October in Mumbai India
Very Large Volume Neutrino Telescopes, 13-15 Oct in Athens Greece
Neutrino, Neutron, ... at ESS, 2-4 December in Lund Sweden

*** Alternating Neutral Currents (II)
</h1> <p>
My mention of Alternating Neutral Currents in the last newsletter
in an item about Gargamelle's award for discovering neutral
currents elicited the largest number of corrections for one item
ever.  They all ascribed the phrase to a competing experiment,
HPWF.  As a first year graduate student in 1974, (before I knew
that particle physicists had personalities), I had heard the
phrase and I remembered it, perhaps incorrectly, in conjunction
with the whole discovery of neutral currents.  If I google
"alternating neutral current" or "alternating neutral currents"
I get 13 hits.  I am most surprised that one of them involves
capacitors and has no relation to neutrinos.

*** Can Neutrinos make us secure?
</h1> <p>
A white paper on the Nuclear Security Applications of
Antineutrino Detectors has been made public:  A. Bernstein
et al.,
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.4338"> arXiv:0908.4338 </a>.
It considers near-field (&lt;100m)
monitoring of PWR's as part of IAEA regime; mid-field (1-10km)
monitoring; and far-field (10-500km) monitoring.  Several
recommendations regard antineutrino R&amp;D and evaluation of
alternative methods to monitor reactors as part of treaties.

*** Can Neutrinos make the economy recover?
</h1> <p>
Funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) are
used to build neutrino experiments; NOvA in particular.  See p9 at

*** PASAG set up by HEPAP; some astrophysics is neutrinos
</h1> <p>
HEPAP formed a subpanel, the Particle Astrophysics Scientific
Assessment Group (PASAG).  The charge and membership can be found
at
<a href="http://www.science.doe.gov/hep/panels/subpanel_list.shtml">
http://www.science.doe.gov/hep/panels/subpanel_list.shtml,
</a>
and
summary slides can be found linked to the most recent HEPAP agenda
<a href="http://www.science.doe.gov/hep/agendas/HEPAPAgendaMay2009.shtml">
http://www.science.doe.gov/hep/agendas/HEPAPAgendaMay2009.shtml. </a>
The subpanel has been at work gathering information from projects in
the areas of Dark Matter, Cosmic Ray/Gamma Ray/VHE Neutrinos, Dark
Energy, and the Cosmic Microwave Background.

*** Neutrinos are no laughing matter
</h1> <p>
Keen readers of long-baseline news sometimes notice that attempts
at humor are injected from time to time.  Therefore it is
appropriate for a comedian (turned politician) to take a tour
of a neutrino experiment, as new Minnesota Senator Al Franken
did recently.

MINOS and NOvA also made news in the Washington Post.
