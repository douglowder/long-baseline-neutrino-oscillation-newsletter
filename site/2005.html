*** Saruhashi prize to Atsuko Ichikawa for long-baseline work
</h1> <p>
T2K spokesperson Atsuko Ichikawa from Kyoto University has been
awarded the the 40th prestigious Saruhashi Prize for "unraveling
the nature of neutrino(s) using an accelerator-based long-baseline
neutrino experiment".  You can find details about the prize at

This review on long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments
with accelerators in Japan has appeared in European Physics
Journal C, v80 (2020) and is a memory of Nishikawa-san
(1949-2018) who deceased during the writing of this review.

*** Registration for Neutrino 2020 Meeting 22 Jun - 2 Jul 2020
</h1> <p>
Registration is required for the online Neutrino 2020 conference
even if you had previously registered for the inperson conference.
There is no fee to attend. Please register for the online event
before 8 Jun.  The deadline to upload posters is 12 June and the
deadline to optionally upload poster videos is also 12 June.  A
vibrant agenda is posted.

*** NNN20 postponed to 2021
</h1> <p>
The International Workshop on Next generation Nucleon Decay and
Neutrino Detector, originally scheduled for 1-3 October in Hida
city Japan has been postponed until 2021.  They will decide the
date of NNN21 when the situation improves substantially.  At the
workshop next year there will be tours of the sites of
Super-Kamiokande and Hyper-Kamiokande.

</p><h1>
*** Neutrino Physics and Machine Learning (NPML)
</h1> <p>
The neutrino physics community has made great use of new tools in
machine learning.  There will be 2 NPML workshops soon.  On 17-19
June, a satellite meeting to Neutrino 2020 will have "lightning
talks".

</a>
Nu2020 poster
presenters are encouraged to give a 10+5 minute oral talk.  A main
workshop 7-17 July will have longer &amp; more detailed discussions.

*** Neutrinos at Snowmass
</h1> <p>
The entire international neutrino physics community is invited to
participate in Snowmass Neutrino Frontier activities.  A wiki can
be found at
<a href="https://snowmass21.org/neutrino/">
https://snowmass21.org/neutrino/
</a>
where information
about each of the ten topical groups is listed.  Note that there
are many connections and overlaps between groups, as well as
between Frontiers.  Submitted Snowmass LOIs will be considered in
all groups.  The conveners are working on identifying liaisons who
will make sure there are no gaps and that there is good
communication.  Regular topical convener meetings have begun and
minutes are available.
<a href="https://indico.fnal.gov/category/1101/">
https://indico.fnal.gov/category/1101/
</a>
An FNAL listserv mailing list, SNOWMASS-NEUTRINO-FRONTIER will be
used mainly for announcements.  We encourage community members to
participate in discussions on Slack, in the #neutrino channel, or
in one of the topical group channels.  A zoom Neutrino Town Hall
is planned, tentatively 17 July 10am-1pm US Eastern.  An in-person
Neutrino Frontier Meeting may be scheduled in Feb/Mar 2021.

Neutrino energy deposition gives that extra energy trying to
revitalize the explosion.

*** DUNE ND Naming contest
</h1> <p>
The DUNE near detector group has been asked to rename what is
currently being called the "Multi-Purpose Detector" and is
soliciting suggestions.   By 12 June 2020, please send ideas to

&amp;

They will collect the list of names and organize a vote for the
names in the list that are okâ€™ed by DUNE management.
