*** Using MINOS to look for theta-13
</H1> <P>
MINOS showed its first analysis for numu to nue oscillations, 
which has sensitivity to theta-13, and a Fermilab seminar
by Mayly Sanchez on February 27.  MINOS observed 35 events with an 
expected background of 27 +- 5(stat) +-2(sys).  MINOS measures
nue-like background in the near detector, but has to extrapolate
to the far detector allowing for numu to nutau oscillations.  
Analysis of 3.14e20 protons on target was carried out with two
background extrapolation methods and two particle identification
methods.  sin^2 2-theta_13 < .29 (.42) for normal (inverted) 
hierarchy. For some values of delta, zero is barely excluded at 
90% CL.   MINOS already has another 3e20 pot.

*** Using Tom Hanks in the context of High Energy Physics
</H1> <P>
I'm not giving anything away, except a punch line of a pun, when I 
quote from the last page of the book "Angels and Demons" which 
will soon be a movie starring Tom Hanks,  "Neutrinos have mass?" 
Langdon shot her a stunned look.  "I didn't even know they were 
Catholic".  Since neutrinos come in families, I can't tell you the 
last 5 paragraphs of the book.  But I can tell you that when the 
LHC is restarted, Tom Hanks will be there to flip the switch.

*** Using a high energy nu experiment for low energy physics
</H1> <P>
A workshop to be held at Penn State will investigate the ways 
that the large Ice cube detector can be used for low energy 
physics, such as supernova detection.  Ice-cube has a high Energy
threshold for muons.

*** Using a low energy nu experiment for high energy physics
</H1> <P>
A new paper by J. Learned et al. explores ways that that a 
liquid scintillator detector can be used as a megaton scale 
context for long-baseline neutrinos and nucleon decay.   But a 
predictable feature of any future large detector that uses 
mineral oil will be a large contingency for the price of oil, 
given recent fluctuations in commodity prices.

*** Using neutrinos for non-proliferation, AAP2009 in Brazil
</H1> <P>
There will be the sixth workshop on applications of antineutrino
physics (featuring non-proliferation aspects) in Paraty Brazil,
near the Angra Nuclear Power plant, on March 19-20 2009.  The
Angra 3 nuclear plant just got environmental approval.

*** Using the adverb "very" regarding baselines
</H1> <P>
This newsletter started by discussing long-baseline neutrino 
oscillations (hence its name).  Note the hyphen connecting the 
adjectives (the baseline is long, not the neutrino).  Tom Weiler 
added very long-baseline news in discussing neutrinos from AGNs.
With the linking of MINOS and the COSMOS experiment (which never 
ran), we also covered short-baseline experiments.  Now a paper 
by Giunti and Laveder 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.1992"> arXiv:0902.1992 </A>
 discusses very 
short-baseline neutrino experiments.

*** More neutrino meetings this March in Europe
</H1> <P>
March will mark the transition from our old FP6 CARE/BENE Network 
to the new FP7 EuCARD/NEu2012  Network.  It will also be the time 
of the first yearly meeting of the FP7 EUROnu Design Study (DS), 
pushed to approval by BENE and started last Sep under the lead of 
R. Edgecock, on Mar  23-27 at CERN.  That will include meetings of
its Neutrino Factory (NF) Work Package, in the larger context of 
the International Design Study (NF-IDS), Betabeam and Superbeam 
Work Packages and of its smaller Physics and Detector Package.
<A href="http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=42846"> 
http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=42846  </A>
The first 
two NEu2012 meetings will take place at CERN 18 Mar & 27 Mar, this
second one in the morning of the last day of the EUROnu week.

*** HEPAP hears about liquid argon for long-baseline neutrinos
</H1> <P>
Bonnie Fleming described the R&D program and plan for Liquid
Argon Time Projection Chamber Program at DUSEL for the Feb
HEPAP meeting.  MicroBooNE at Fermilab, and a 5 kiloton liquid
argon detector are the first steps towards the needed big
detectors.  She covered the challenges, the R&D progress, and
the reasons for modular detectors.

<H1>
*** DUSEL long-baseline neutrino collaboration meets
</H1> <P>
80 physicists met at UC-Davis to continue planning an ambitious 
neutrino beam from Fermilab to Homestake SD.  There are 3 phases
in any project.  Phase 1 is irrational exuberance.  Phase 2 is 
work, problems, and overcoming setbacks.  Phase 3 is success.  
This project will need significant funding from both DOE & NSF.  
'S4' submissions for both water Cerenkov and Liquid Argon 
detectors were submitted in January.  There is a DUSEL 
Experimental Development Committee (DEDC - pronounced dead sea).  
There were 25 S4 proposals altogether 8 non-physics, but many of 
them neutrino.  At DUSEL, there are now 68 full time and 28 
part-time employees, plus many contractors on site, involved 
with pumping, inspections, etc.

<H1>
*** DOE and NSF to cooperate on long-baseline DUSEL (LBNE)
</H1> <P>
The 2 agencies are supporting each other to achieve their shared
scientific goals. The model under consideration is for the NSF 
to lead the design, construction and operation of DUSEL, with 
support from DOE for individual experiments.  The DOE will lead 
the design, construction and operation of the LBNE beam and 
detector, with support from NSF for elements of both.  It is 
understood that efforts are subject to approval by respective 
agencies, the administration (OMB/OSTP) and Congress.  Each 
agency will follow its own procedures and policies.  For the DOE, 
this involves "Critical Decisions" CD0 etc.  DOE and NSF will 
work together closely to coordinate their efforts, avoid 
duplication, and optimize their investments.
