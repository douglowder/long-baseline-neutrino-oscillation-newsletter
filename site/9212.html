</p><h1>Gina Rameika to be NUMI project manager</h1>
Gina Rameika, the associate head of the research
division, has joined the NUMI group as the project
manager.   She has already pushed ahead within Fermilab
to get the go ahead on some of the necessary engineering
for the cost of the beam.

<h1>P860 Proposal presentation.</h1>
In early December, the proposal for using the p-bar
accumulator as a neutrino source was made to the PAC and
was well received.   (I wasn't there) but apparently the
PAC discussed this in the context of the Main Injector
neutrino proposals, and one PAC member suggested a
workshop to discuss these issues.  It was pointed out
that we already had such a workshop.

<h1>P822 meeting date changed</h1>
Changes in the Soudan 2 collaboration meeting date have
required that the P822 meeting date, previously
announced for March 30th, be changed.  The present date,
which has not been finalized, is Thursday April 15th, at
Fermilab.

<h1>New proposal by April possible goal</h1>
Activity at Fermilab on the long baseline possibility
has been rather intense.  A goal has been suggested that
revised proposals be submitted by April, so that up
to date information can be before the PAC during their
summer meeting.  This schedule will require a major push
to get a revised document ready by then.

<h1>Tufts short term postdoc working on NUMI</h1>
Stephan Willocque, a recent graduate student who just
got a reprieve from expected service in the Belgian
army, will be hired at Tufts as a short term post-doc to
calculate NUMI related physics items.  One presentation
that he has already shown, is that by using a
multi-variable analysis on the P803 data, he can choose
events to scan so that 803 can run about 3 times longer
than in the original proposal with no additional scan
load.  This analysis technique may help enrich the
neutral current to charged current test in Soudan/P822.

<h1>CERN long baseline workshop may be international</h1>
conference
The CERN workshop has not yet been rescheduled, but may
become a more formal affair with official CERN backing
and an International Advisory Committee.
