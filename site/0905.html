*** Why should neutrino physicists go to CERN?  October workshop
</h1> <p>
A 3-day workshop is scheduled at CERN for October 1-3 to consider
the future of neutrino physics with emphasis on the development
work required for accelerator based neutrino physics. The workshop
is being organized jointly by the CERN Management, the Scientific
Policy Committee &amp; the European Committee for Future Accelerators.
This is in line with the conclusions of the European Strategy for
Particle Physics  "[4]... it is vital to strengthen the advanced
accelerator R&amp;D program; a coordinated programs should be
intensified, to develop the CLIC technology and high performance
magnets for future accelerators, and to play a significant role in
the study and development of a high-intensity neutrino facility.
[6]. Studies of the scientific case for future neutrino facilities
and the R&amp;D into associated technologies are required to be in a
position to define the optimal neutrino program based on the
information available in around 2012;
Council will play an active role in promoting a coordinated
European participation in a global neutrino program."
(CERN strategy document, 2006).

*** Why Congressman Foster went to Minnesota - "The Ash River Address"
</h1> <p>
At the NOvA experiment dedication, Foster gave a speech (allegedly
written on the airplane) eerily similar to one by A. Lincoln. "...
dedicated to testing the proposition that all neutrinos are
created equal."  It's good enough for the neutrino poetry page:

The original
speech is loved by most, but not all (For example, see

A more serious
interview with Congressman Foster stresses the importance of
nus to Fermilab -

*** Why we want less data
</h1> <p>
Most errors are proportional to the square root of the amount of
data, so as the data grows, so do the errors.  Luckily, neutrino
cross sections are small, so we don't have much data or errors.

</p><h1>
*** Why have theorists?
</h1> <p>
Theorists give us ideas and predict things, of the form, "If T,
then B", and we experimentalists go look for B.  But finding B
doesn't prove T, and in fact we can't prove T.  So why have
theories?  Luckily, there is no good theory of neutrinos.  L.
Wolfenstein once told me that we have 1000 neutrino theories,
which is like having no theory.

*** Why do neutrinos oscillate?
</h1> <p>
Harry Lipkin always offers the rest of us provocative insights
into a variety of physics topics, and he has been thinking
about neutrino oscillations; in particular is the initial state
an energy eigenstate?  a momentum eigenstate?  is it coherent?
Some recent thoughts include "Why do neutrinos oscillate?"

*** Why is the governor of South Dakota Happy?
</h1> <p>
The pumping of water out of the Homestake mine, the future site
of the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Lab (DUSEL), has
reached below the 4850-foot level, where many experiments will be
located.  Gov. Mike Rounds made the announcement May 13 09, "This
is a benchmark day in the quest to convert the mine into a world-
class laboratory for underground science," the Governor said. "The
historic Homestake Mine yielded 40 million ounces of gold before
it was shut down in 2001, but it will someday yield something more
valuable than any precious metal:  knowledge about the universe
and the world around us".

*** Why do some people still think the muon neutrino has a mass?
</h1> <p>
"it's mass is about a third of an electron"  It is cuddly, too.

*** Why revive a Tevatron Neutrino Program?
</h1> <p>
A working group has looked at the wide variety of physics that
could be accomplished with a new TeV neutrino program.
Two proton sources are potentially available in the future: the
existing Tevatron at Fermilab, which can provide 800 GeV protons
for fixed-target physics, and a possible upgrade to the SPS at
CERN, called SPS+, which would produce 1 TeV protons on target.
Topics include charm, tau neutrinos, standard model physics,
sterile neutrino searches.

*** Why study atmospheric oscillations?
</h1> <p>
Matter driven theta13 effects are absent if theta13 is too small.
Independent measurements of Delta31 and Delta32 can lead to
hierarchy determination.  The difference is Delta21, and one
needs Delta21 L/E&gt;1.  This is satisfied by atmospheric neutrinos,
but it is still hard.  Gandhi et al.,
