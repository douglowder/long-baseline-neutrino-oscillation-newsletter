*** Daya Bay compares first two detectors
</H1> <P>
Two near detectors at the Daya Bay reactor neutrino experiment
have been operating since 23 Sep 2011.  A comparison of two
months worth of data, mostly from the two Daya Bay reactors,
shows that the detectors are functionally identical, and that
detector-related systematic uncertainties are well under control.

*** T2K long-baseline neutrino experiment run resumes in Japan
</H1> <P>
<A href="http://t2k-experiment.org/category/news/">
http://t2k-experiment.org/category/news/  </A>
The first T2K beam 
nu event since the Mar 2011 earthquake was seen in Super-K 
(T2K's far detector) on 26 Jan 2012.  It has a muon which was 
made when the beam interacted with a nucleon in Oxygen.

*** The neutrino mass hierarchy; the next big thing
</H1> <P>
We've likely measured a non-zero theta-13.  Our collider friends
aren't positive if there is a standard model Higgs, but if there
is, we know its mass.  Whether the neutrino mass hierarchy is
"normal" or "inverted" (i.e. if m3 > m1, m2 or if m3 < m1, m2)
is the next neutrino property we might know.  Sensitivity to the
hierarchy can be had in charge sensitive atmospheric nu angular 
distributions, matter effect differences in electron nu and antinu 
appearance measurements, supernova energy spectra in some models, 
comparison of delta_msquareds measured by accelerator and reactor 
experiments, and neutrinoless double beta decay.  Here's a 
difference; with non-zero theta-13 or the Higgs mass, we still want 
to measure them more accurately.  When the hierarchy is determined, 
we'll be done with that task, and there is nothing to do better.

*** Fermilab plan for discovery

A new document 
describes Fermilab's scientific strategy for the next two decades. 
A large fraction of the intensity frontier is devoted to nus.

*** Europe's plans for discovery
</H1> <P>
A 3 day workshop will be held at CERN to discuss the future of
neutrino oscillation research in Europe 14-16 May 2012.

*** LBNE moving forward in US and budget issues
</H1> <P>

Progress in putting together the LBNE experiment may be slowed 
but not stopped in the proposed 2013 administration budget (PBR)
which would cut spending from $21M this year to $10M next, despite
the strong support of the DOE Office of High Energy Physics.
Recently Fermilab gave a briefing on LBNE to Bill Brinkman, the 
Head of the DOE Office of Science and acting Under Secretary for 
Science, to discuss a path forward towards a decision on LBNE.  
An exchange between Congressman Hultgren and OSTP Director Holdren 
on LBNE is found in AIP-FYI:

*** GLADE idea for liquid argon detector at NOvA
</H1> <P>
A new idea for an off-axis detector seeks to foster international 
collaboration with significant European Involvement.  The Global 
Liquid Argon Detector Experiment (GLADE) would be on the surface 
at Ash River, 810 km from FNAL, in the same hall as NOvA.  An LOI 
sent to Fermilab shows how a 7 year run (2 with neutrinos, 5 with 
antineutrinos) combined with T2K and NOvA, would help define the 
mass hierarchy.  UCL's Jenny Thomas is the contact person.

*** What's in a name?
</H1> <P>
<A href="http://www.fnal.gov/directorate/Longrange/Steering_Public/Name-ProjectX.html"> 
http://www.fnal.gov/directorate/Longrange/Steering_Public/Name-ProjectX.html
</A>
Fermilab's idea of a more powerful booster replacement (Project X)
was looking for a name, and hasn't found one yet.  Maybe it will 
be called Project X.  A new movie "Project X" is in theaters.  At
imdb.com there are 12 movie/tv names using Project X.  Speaking of 
names, experiments have names that are often shown wrong.  It is 
Double Chooz, not Double CHOOZ or Double-Chooz; Soudan 2, not 
Soudan II; Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment, not Long Baseline 
Neutrino Experiment; Super-Kamiokande, not SuperKamiokande; NOvA, 
not NoVA; Send me any other nu names if there is a common blunder.

*** OPERA statement on velocity rumor
</H1> <P>
"The OPERA Collaboration, by continuing its campaign of 
verifications on the neutrino velocity measurement, has identified 
two issues that could significantly affect the reported result. 
The first one is linked to the oscillator used to produce the 
events time-stamps in between the GPS synchronizations. The second 
point is related to the connection of the optical fiber bringing 
the external GPS signal to the OPERA master clock.  These two 
issues can modify the neutrino time of flight in opposite 
directions. While continuing our investigations, in order to 
unambiguously quantify the effect on the observed result, the 
Collaboration is looking forward to performing a new measurement 
of the neutrino velocity as soon as a new bunched beam will be 
available in 2012. An extensive report on the above mentioned 
verifications and results will be shortly made available to the 
scientific committees and agencies."

A rather specific rumor says the problem was a loose connector.
