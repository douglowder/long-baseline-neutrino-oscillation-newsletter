*** KEK to Superkamiokande experiment with PS approved</h1>
The idea of using the KEK PS to send neutrinos toward
Miyama before the 50 GeV machine is built has been formally
but conditionally approved.  It is known as KEK experiment 362.
The condition is of course money.  It is scheduled to finish
construction in 1998. The cost is about 40M$, including
beam and detector.

*** Oak Ridge Workshop on neutrinos 26-27 September</h1>
A mini-workshop on the Utilization of the High-Powered (&gt;1MW)
Short-Pulsed (&lt;1 us) NSNS Facility for Low-Energy Neutrino
Research at Oak Ridge will be 26-27 Sep.  National Spallation
Neutron Source (NSNS) is proposed starting FY98.  The workshop
will focus on 1.  the feasibility of using NSNS;  2.  current
neutrino knowledge; 3. neutrino bunker design; and  4. costs.
Organizer is Tony Gabriel:

*** Neutrino Oscillation Industry Web Page Updated</h1>
A web page on KEK362 is available from the Neutrino Oscillation
Industry Web page, as are new links to Palo Verde, Karmen,
Nestor and others.  A new page on neutrino meetings, includes
both upcoming meetings and previous ones.   There's a graphics
version (with experimental logos') but it takes too much time
to load so it isn't the default.   Link these pages from:

*** DONUT progress</h1>
Donut, The Direct Nutau experiment (872) is getting ready for
the proton beam to hit the upstream dump (300m).  This will
check out their beamline and provide muons for drift chamber
tests.  The large magnet downstream of the dump, called SELMA,
has been moved into place, and the coils, which are being
reinsulated, are due back in August.  The stacking of muon walls
is complete.  Proportional tubes and scintillating fiber
trackers are being installed in August, completing electronic
spectrometer elements.

*** Neutrino 2000 and Neutrino 2002</h1>
Neutrino 98 will be held in Sudbury Canada in June 1998.
Neutrino 2000 will be at Kamioka.  Neutrino 2002 will be in
Munich.  WIN97 will be at Capri in June 1997, and TAUP97 will
be at Gran Sasso in September 1997.

*** Congressman Oberstar visits Soudan</h1>
On July 10, Minnesota's 8th-district congressman, James Oberstar
visited the Soudan Underground Laboratory, along with University
of Minnesota regent Jessica Phillips.  He told his hosts, that
it was an "exciting adventure of the mind", and that we could
"count on him to continue supporting our endeavors in every way
that he can".

<p> </p><h1>
*** Tours of Soudan available at DPF meeting.</h1>
The DPF divisional meeting at Minneapolis on 10-15 August will
include a visit to the Soudan mine on 16 August.  For
information, see http://www.hep.umn.edu/dpf96/soudan.html

*** Neutrino Summer School at Erice in 1997</h1>
The 19th Erice Course will focus on "Neutrinos in Astro,
Particle and Nuclear Physics" from September 16-24, 1997
in Erice/Sicily/Italy.  Applicants are urged to contact
them via email at

Oscillations", WIS-96/23/Jun-PH;  the usual treatment of
oscillations is in time, while in most experiments, the distance
is the well measured parameter.  The two identical phase shifts
obtained describe the same physics;  adding them together
is double counting.
