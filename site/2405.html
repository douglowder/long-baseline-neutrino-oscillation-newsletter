*** ANL's NuFact 2024 registration/abstract submission pages open
</h1> <p>
The 25th International Workshop on Neutrinos from Accelerators
will take place at Argonne from 16-21 Sep.  The registration page
is now open and abstract submission is welcomed.  The focus is
neutrino and muon physics and the accelerators and detectors
needed to measure them.

*** T2K and Super-K joint fit
</h1> <p>
In
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12488"> arXiv:2405.12488, </a>
T2K and Super-Kamiokande present a 1st joint
measurement of atmospheric and beam neutrino data.  Using 3244.4 d
of atmospheric nu data and 19.7(16.3)e20 pot in nu(antinu) mode,
they measure neutrino oscillation parameters.  The results show an
exclusion of CP-conservation at 1.9-2.0 sigma, limited preference
for the normal ordering, and no strong octant preference for q_23.

</p><h1>
*** Neutrinos and the moon
</h1> <p>
Over 30 years ago, Ken Lande pointed out that a long-baseline
neutrino beam from the SSC to a detector on the moon would
sample a region of L/E parameter space comparable to the suggested
value which would explain the solar neutrino problem.  (He knew
about the problems at the time, and soon there was one more.) In a
year with a widely-viewed eclipse and a blue moon, recent papers
suggest other ways to exploit the moon for particle physics.

</p><h1>
*** Lunar antineutrinos and heat
</h1> <p>
In
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00882"> arXiv:2406.00882, </a>
Dye and Barma estimate the fluxes of heat
and antineutrinos within the moon.  They find 302 GW of radiogenic
heating in the crust and an additional 185 GW in the mantle, and
nu fluxes of 2.02e6 and 6.40e5 cm^(-2)s^(-1) respectively.

</p><h1>
*** Neutrino Gravitational Wave Memory from SN using the moon
</h1> <p>
In
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13211"> arXiv:2405.13211 </a>
K. Gill describes the possibility of seeing
GW linear memory, a phenomenon resulting from a combination of
aspherical matter ejection and anisotropic nu emission during
stellar collapse - using gravitational wave detectors on the moon.

</p><h1>
*** The moon - the final frontier for proton decay
</h1> <p>
Underground detectors searching for evidence of GUTs inspired
nucleon decay have to deal with ~100/year/kiloton background
events from atmospheric neutrinos.  This background doesn't
exist on the moon.  In
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15845"> arXiv:2405.15845 </a>,
S. Baum et al. show a
competitive sensitivity from using a 100 g paleo-detector sample
from the moon to search for evidence of p -&gt; nu K+ tracks.

*** NNN 2024 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the week of 28 October.
</h1> <p>
The 23nd International Workshop on Next Generation Nucleon Decay &amp;
Neutrino Detectors (NNN 24) will be held at the Brazilian center
for Research in Physics (CBPF).  NNN 24 is jointly organized by
CBPF and the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.

*** TeVPA at University of Chicago 26-30 August 2024
</h1> <p>
The TeV Particle Astrophysics workshop covers the most recent
advances in the field of Particle Astrophysics.

*** Neutrino University on zoom 26 Jun - 28 Aug
</h1> <p>
Each year, the Fermilab Neutrino Physics Center organizes a series
of lectures to provide a crash course on all things neutrinos to
students there and simultaneously via Zoom.  The target audience
of these seminars are (under)graduate-level experimental students,
although theory and other participants are likely to join.  The
seminars will run Wednesdays at 11am CDT.  Subscribe to maillist

*** SBND finds the booster beam
</h1> <p>
Using a run for which 111 photomultipliers were on, during the
night of 8-9 May, SBND measured 876 events out of 8291 beam spills
with an uptime of ~40 minutes.  In the first ever "top-hat" plot,
(i.e. events versus time with respect to the beam spill), they
clearly saw the 1.6 microsecond structure of FNAL's booster beam.

*** DOE focus on Minerva
</h1> <p>
An article, which can be found on the Office of Science web page,
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/science/articles/neutrinos-offer-new-way-investigate-building-blocks-matter">
https://www.energy.gov/science/articles/neutrinos-offer-new-way-investigate-building-blocks-matter
</a>
describes how Minerva used neutrons to separate interactions off
Carbon &amp; Hydrogen which were in a polystyrene target.  Identifying
5000 antineutrino interactions on H, they calculated the protonâ€™s
weak charge radius for the first time.  It was similar to the
electric charge radius of the proton.

</p><h1>
*** Eos Neutrino Detector Tests Begin
</h1> <p>
Called Eos, for the Titan goddess of dawn, the detector is a 10-m-
tall, 5-m-wide cylinder filled with water &amp; organic scintillator.
It will combine scintillation and Cherenkov emission to better
detect neutrinos, for both nonproliferation &amp; fundamental physics.
