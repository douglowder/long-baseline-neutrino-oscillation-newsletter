*** Baton Rouge Neutrino Meeting
</h1>
There will be an NNN (Next Neutrino &amp; Nucleon Decay) Workshop with
an emphasis on Experiments for a National Underground Lab; It's at
LSU on December 10-12.  For this and the next three meetings, see

*** Barcelona Workshop 9-11 November.
</h1>
There will be a workshop on a massive underground neutrino
detector with leptonic charge sign discrimination 9-11 November
2001 in Barcelona.  The objective of the workshop is to
investigate the feasibility and the physics reach of a very large
detector with leptonic charge-sign discrimination, with a typical
mass of 50 to 100 ktons, for studies of atmospheric and of long
and very long baseline neutrinos from Neutrino Factories.

*** Japanese meetings on Neutrinos and Xenon detectors
</h1>
An "International Workshop on Technique and Application of Xenon
Detectors" will be held at University of Tokyo, Japan, on Dec 3-4.
The purpose of this workshop is to discuss all aspects of
experiments using xenon, including problems and techniques.   The
"International Workshop on Neutrino Oscillations and their Origin"
will be held there 5-8 Dec.   Initiated by the discovery of
neutrino oscillations in atmospheric neutrinos in Super-Kamiokande,
the series of the workshop entitled "Neutrino Oscillations and
their Origin" has been held since 2000 in Japan.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Japanese association with neutrinos
</h1>
Japan is responsible for the landmark experiment on atmospheric
neutrinos, and crucial solar neutrino results.  Japanese
technology (emulsion) is also responsible for nu-tau detection.
We anxiously wait as the nobel prize season approaches.

*** Controversy on Japanese events on MINOS Mural
</h1>
The Cold Dark Matter Experiment (CDMS) shares the Soudan Lab
with MINOS which is installing a grand mural with many neutrino
references.  The inclusion of some Super-K events has been
controversial.    CDMS will offer a  smaller, yet complementary
mural on their side, depicting a large, stick moose being chased
by a pack of stick wolves.  It won't represent history, or
science, or anything profound at all.  It will just warn people
what is going on in the next cavern.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrino Haiku,
</h1>
It's time for another contest.  Please send in your Neutrino
Haiku. Original poems are encouraged.  (No Japanese please.)

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrino Strike
</h1>
A strike by Minnesota Public Employees has shut down the Soudan
mine, where MINOS is being installed.  The mine is operated by
the state Department of Natural Resources.  Jesse Ventura's smile
couldn't stop the strike.  Maybe his smile caused the strike?

<p> </p><h1>
*** Fermilab's Project Rescued
</h1>
Despite the traumatic events of mid September, a review and
rebaselining of the NuMI project took place at Fermilab.
$33M will be added to the project cost, which now totals
$171.4M, and the schedule was adjusted to take into account delays in
civil construction of the NuMI beamline (which is now more than
half done).  First neutrinos are now expected in mid 2005.

<p> </p><h1>
*** OMNIS
</h1>
The Observatory for Multiflavor NeutrInos from Supernovae is
ready to turn in its $37M proposal.  OMNIS concentrates on the
neutral current interactions.  Originally conceived as a 10 kT
iron-scintillator sandwich, an alternate design using phototubes
and 2 kTon of lead perchlorate is now favored.  It could measure
3000 nue events, 25 nuebar and 325 numu+nutau events from a
supernova at 8 kiloparsecs.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrino Show
</h1>
In Annecy (France) on 27 February 2002 at 19h there will be a dance
show named "66 billions/cm2/second".  Of course, the neutrino is
the central part of the show.  Notice a preference for theoretical
value of the solar neutrino flux rather than for measurement.

<p> </p><h1>
*** First manmade neutrinos
</h1>
Arguably the first manmade neutrinos were made at the CP-1 pile
under Stagg Field at the University of Chicago Dec 1942-Early 1943.
That event was remembered by many during the celebrations for Enrico
Fermi's 100th birthday, 9/29/1. Lincoln Wolfenstein was an
undergraduate there and walked along Stagg Field every day to get to
his meal co-op.  If he had known about the pile, he would have
walked on the other side of the street.  Is this a matter effect?

<p> </p><h1>
*** Tim Toohig
</h1>
Tim Toohig, one of the first collaborators on the Fermilab to
Minnesota long-baseline neutrino experiment, died unexpectedly
while visiting SLAC on September 26th.  An expert on tunneling at
Fermilab and the SSC, he had planned to write up his SSC
experiences in a book.  He was well known as a catholic jesuit priest.
