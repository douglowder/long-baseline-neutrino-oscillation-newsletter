*** Groundbreaking for CNGS
</h1>At 11:45 on 12 Oct, the CERN Director General dug the first earth
for the CERN Neutrinos to Gran Sasso.  Civil Engineering works are
expected to continue until April 2003, first beam to Gran Sasso
is scheduled for May 2005.   But the civil engineering job for 
CNGS was considerably complicated by the CERN Courier (12/00)

by painting an Italian instead of a French flag over the location 
of the SPS accelerator at CERN - now Italy is where the beam 
starts, then under Switzerland, but where is Gran Sasso??  CNGS 
has a snazzy new web page

*** Underground Facility Initiative
</h1>The NSF & DOE are supporting the work of a national committee to
investigate whether the U.S. should develop a National Underground
Laboratory and recommend a site.  The final meeting will be 
Mar 3-4.  The committee wants 1-2 page `letters of interest' from 
experimenters interested in using such a lab.  For format, see
<a href="http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/underground.txt"> 
http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/underground.txt </a>
To be most useful to the committee, the letters must be
received by John Bahcall by Friday, February 19th. 

<p> <h1>
*** Wolfgang Pauli 70
</h1>The 70th anniversary of the neutrino provoked a response that the 
story of Pauli and his commitments from Dec 4th to 7th 1930 would 
make a good novel.  The Zurich ball may have been a blind: no one 
in their senses could ever believe that Pauli would be 
indispensible at a ball; he would cause untold carnage.   It was 
said that he was not able to travel because he could not miss his 
daughter's birthday. But this was possibly an excuse also, since 
he was very tentative about his neutrino hypothesis; apart from 
that letter he did not put anything down on paper for another 
2 years ( after he had heard about Fermi's calculations?).

<p> <h1>
*** Enrico Fermi 34
</h1>The namer of the neutrino will be honored with a United States 
Postage Stamp on his 100th birthday, September 29, 2001 in 
Chicago.   Such a stamp was one goal of a Fermilab UEC stamp 
campaign:

The image chosen shows Fermi at a blackboard with a few 
equations.  Of course it will be a 34 cent stamp.

*** Ernest Rutherford 18
</h1>The 
<a href="http://www.anta.canterbury.ac.nz/neutrino/"> 
18th International Workshop on Weak Interactions and 
Neutrinos </a> will be held in New Zealand on the campus of
The University of Canterbury, Christchurch.  This was the 
location of the undergraduate studies of Ernest Rutherford.

*** Neutrino Factory addition to Neutrino Oscillation Industry
</h1>
<a href="http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/nuindustry.html"> 
http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/nuindustry.html </a>
A long-realized defect of the nu oscillation industry web site 
has been addressed with the expansion of the "Future Neutrino 
Facility Initiatives" section to include nu factories.  
Suggestions on arranging the content are welcome.  UNO and the 
Underground Physics site search are also included.
 
<p> <h1>
*** Neutrino preparations for Snowmass (?)
</h1>Neutrino physics has benefitted from support for many new 
projects recently.  But this also means that many neutrino 
physicists have even less time to think about the long term 
future, where opportunities for further neutrino progress are 
probably large.  Come on, neutrino community, lets get a little 
noisier as Snowmass approaches.

<p> <h1>
*** Reducing the speed of neutrinos to zero
</h1>The discovery of neutrino mass allows us to go into the rest 
frame of the neutrino, but no slow neutrinos are yet in evidence.
With recent attention 
<a href="http://sciam.com/news/011901/1.html"> 
http://sciam.com/news/011901/1.html </a>
given to stopping light, slow nus might get some attention, but 
not soon.   Primordial neutrinos might be non-relativistic.

<p> <h1>
*** George Bush and the case of the pilfered W's
</h1>Were they taken by miniBooNE scientists, who hope to see an 
increase in (W mediated) nu-e charged current interactions?

<p> <h1>
*** Site specific neutrino factory study at BNL
</h1>After study 1 at Fermilab, Study 2 for a neutrino factory at BNL 
is not the study-to-end-all-studies; but it is one step beyond a 
feasibility study.   The cost estimate is expected early March, 
with a final report and closeout with BNL management in April.
