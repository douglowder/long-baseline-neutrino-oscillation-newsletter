<H1>Long-Baseline news, March 2024 </H1>
<P>

*** Will we see neutrinos from T Coronae Borealis?
</H1> <P>
<A href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240322-visible-nova-explosion-is-coming">

</A>
A nova @ 1 kpc visible during the day is expected in a few months.
Supernovae emit neutrinos, but what about novae?  Look anyway but

says no.

<H1>
*** Fermilab Beam restarts
</H1> <P>
After a longer-than-expected shutdown, the Fermilab neutrino beam
has restarted, and the NuMI power was 812 kW as I write this.

*** 2024 Neutrino Oscillation Workshop in Italy
</H1> <P>
<A href="https://home.ba.infn.it/~now/now2024/">
https://home.ba.infn.it/~now/now2024/
</A>
  The biannual Neutrino
Oscillation Workshop (NOW 2024) will be held 2-8 September in
Otranto (Lecce Italy).  The four pillars of oscillations are 1.)
standard 3-nu oscillations, 2.) Beyond Standard nu framework, 3.)
Neutrino mass states and interactions, & 4.) From the sky & cosmos

<H1>
*** Neutrino 2024 16-22 June 2024 in Milano
</H1> <P>
Due to the exceptional number of abstract submissions for Neutrino
2024, far exceeding the space available to display them, the time
required to down-select is taking much longer than expected.
Submitters have already started to receive their approval or
rejection, but more time is needed to complete the process.

<H1>
*** NuFact 2024
</H1> <P>
This will be 16-21 September at Argonne in Illinois.  Registration
will probably open early May.

*** Neutrino Beam Class 15-19 July in Rohnert Park California
</H1> <P>
At the U.S. Particle Accelerator School this year there will be a
1-week course on Neutrino Beams.  The course is open to all levels
of participants. Substantial support will be provided for for grad
students, who can earn graduate-level credit transferable to their
university.

*** Invisibles School in Bologna 24-28 June 2024
</H1> <P>
Invisibles School 2024 (
<A href="https://agenda.infn.it/event/39074/">
https://agenda.infn.it/event/39074/</A>) will
take place in Bologna, Italy.  It precedes Invisibles24 Workshop.
<A href="https://agenda.infn.it/event/39073/">
https://agenda.infn.it/event/39073/</A>
 which will take place 
1-5 July.  They aim at a broad audience working in the areas of
neutrino, dark matter, astroparticle physics, cosmology.

<H1>
*** How long is long-baseline neutrino news?
</H1> <P>
It is not long, but the baselines of some neutrino experiments are
long.  I stop at 111 lines of ASCII text, and it can be printed on
two 8.5" x 11" sheets of paper.  Why are newspaper pages so large?
The original rationale was that the British enacted in 1712 a tax
on newspapers based on the number of pages in each edition.

<H1>
*** Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility Project Director retires
</H1> <P>
<A href="https://inside.fnal.gov/2024/04/chris-mossey-lbnf-dune-us-project-director-retires/">
https://inside.fnal.gov/2024/04/chris-mossey-lbnf-dune-us-project-director-retires/
</A>
(requires FNAL services account to access).
Admiral Chris Mossey, who joined Fermilab in August of 2015, is
retiring after eight years and 800,000 tons of excavated rock
(approximately equal to the mass of eight Nimitz class aircraft
carriers, by his figuring).  In the picture in the above link,
Chris is standing next to my daughter who represented Warrenville.

<H1>
*** SURF Request for Letters of Interest (LOI)
</H1> <P>
<A href="https://sanfordlab.org/researchers/proposal-guidelines">
https://sanfordlab.org/researchers/proposal-guidelines</A>
 SURF is
pleased to announce a request for LOIs for underground space at
its facility.  Space in existing developed areas (testbeds and
laboratories) will be coming available in 1-4 years, and space in
undeveloped areas is potentially available now. In addition, SURF
is tremendously excited about new large caverns that will be
developed on the 4850L â€” initial construction started 22 March,
and space is expected to be available on the timeframe of ~2030.
