<H1>Long-Baseline news, December 2006 </H1>
<P>

<H1>
*** Fermilab long-baseline nu beam and detector projects combined
</H1> <P>
At the prodding of the Office of Management and Budget (which cares
about such things), the DOE is combining NOvA and the Proton Plan
Phase II.  NOvA is the off-axis long-baseline experiment at
Fermilab to measure theta-13 and, if theta-13 is large enough,
matter effects.  The proton plan is a variety of measures to
increase the Main Injector Intensity, mostly to provide "protons 
on target" (pot) for NOvA.  Among other things, this bureaucratic
move affects the schedule for reviews.

*** How to get a neutrino experiment from Deggendorf to Karlsruhe
</H1> <P>
KATRIN is an experiment to measure the neutrino mass by carefully 
measuring the electron energy at the endpoint of Tritium beta 
decay.  By using a large spectrometer, it can improve the limit on 
(Sum (U_ei)**2 m_i) from 2 eV to 0.2 eV.  The spectrometer was 
built in Deggendorf and needed to be moved to Karlsruhe, about 400 
km away.  However, it is too big to transport by truck, so it was 
moved by boat, through Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Serbia, 
Romania, Bulgaria, Ukraine, into the Black Sea, through the 
Dardanelles, the Mediterranean, the Strait of Gibraltar, the 
Atlantic, the English Channel, into Holland and down the Rhine.

*** If a neutrino equipment comes to town...
</H1> <P>
...will the town show up to see?  Yes!  After a 9000km sea voyage
to go 400km, it still had a few km by truck.  See "1 picture worth 
1000 words" -

*** SNO completed
</H1> <P>
Over the months ahead, the heavy water in the core of the SNO 
detector will be removed and returned to Atomic Energy of Canada 
Limited and Ontario Power Generation. Modifications to the 
detector are planned and funding is being sought to adapt it to a 
new liquid scintillator core which will enable it to further 
sensitive measurements of neutrinos from the Sun and from the core 
of the earth, as well as studying a very rare and fundamental form 
of radioactivity .neutrinoless double beta decay.

*** Reflector leak at CNGS
</H1> <P>
After the extremely smooth start of the CNGS run, the run was 
stopped Oct 27 when rapidly increasing water levels in a safety 
reservoir indicated a water leak in the CNGS reflector area.
The 2nd horn at CNGS is called the reflector.  It was decided to 
stop the CNGS run for 2006.  The leak will be fixed by the time
the emulsion target for OPERA is installed in 2007.

*** ANITA launched 
</H1> <P>
The ANITA balloon-borne high-energy neutrino telescope launched 
from McMurdo Antarctica on Dec 15, 2006, which is 95 y + 1 d after 
Amundsen was the first to reach the South Pole.  The primary 
purpose of ANITA is to detect cosmogenic (GZK) neutrinos. Pictures 
and movies (Quicktime) of payload preparation and launch can be 
found at

*** SciBooNE installs scintillator
</H1> <P>
The SciBar portion of SciBooNE was installed in December
<A href="http://www.fnal.gov/pub/today/archive_2006/today06-12-14.html">
http://www.fnal.gov/pub/today/archive_2006/today06-12-14.html.</A>
SciBooNE is a neutrino detector that will inhabit a 23-by-16-foot 
pit about 300-feet downstream of the neutrino beam source, powered by 
the booster accelerator.  It will have scintillator, an electron
catcher, and muon range detector.  See some entries in the SciBooNE 
logos contest at

*** Neutrino Meetings
</H1> <P>
<A href="http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/numeetings.html">
http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/numeetings.html </A>
now features 
2007.  Recent additions include the 2nd Low Emittance Muon 
collider workshop, 12-16 Feb at Fermilab, where they would like
more attendance from the neutrino community.  Also there is 
Neutrino Telescopes Mar 6-9 in Venice, Italy, and NuFACT07, 
6-11 Aug in Okayama Japan.  53 meetings were listed in 2006!

*** Neutrino worker from South Pole joins cast of TV show
</H1> <P>
Kathy Najimy, has joined the cast of the TV show Numb3rs as sort
of a Dean at Cal Tech, after working at the "Amanda neutrino 
telescope".  Her character's name is Mildred (Millie) French.
