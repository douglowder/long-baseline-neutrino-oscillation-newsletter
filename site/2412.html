*** No Main Injector running at Fermilab in FY2025 for NOvA
</H1> <P>

A message from Chief Research Officer Bonnie Fleming mentioned the
following:  After an August fire at the Kautz Road substation and
assessments of the transformers at Fermilab, it was determined
that repair of 5 of the 8 transformers is required. Also the Main
Injector Heat Exchanger system is in need of repair.  Fermilab has
announced that due to the challenges with the transformers and the
heat exchangers, they are unable to provide beam for Main Injector
programs in FY25, including the NuMI and SY120 programs.   There
will be beam in the Booster for the short-baseline nu program
using SBND and ICARUS.  The Booster Neutrino Beamline started on
10 December. This FY25 accelerator run will continue to July.

*** IMB site chosen as an APS historic site
</H1> <P>
In 2024, the Morton Salt Mine, the home of the IMB nucleon decay
experiment was chosen as an historic site by the American Physical
Society.  At a ceremony in August, a plaque recognized "The Birth
of Neutrino Astronomy" through the simultaneous measurement of
neutrinos in the IMB detector in Painesville Ohio as well as the
Kamiokande experiment in the Kamioka mine in Japan.

This experiment, using reactor neutrinos to determine the mass
ordering of the three neutrinos (normal or inverted) plans to
start taking data in the summer of 2025.  The sphere will hold
20 kT of liquid scintillator, and be surrounded by a cylindrical
pit of water.  Filling of the water pit started 18 December.

*** Sunil K. Gupta elected President-Designate of IUPAP
</H1> <P>
I met Sunil working on a neutrino experiment at Fermilab.  His 3-
year term started 1 Jan. 2025. He is the 2nd Indian to be elected
after Homi J. Bhabha, who served 1960–63. IUPAP, the International
Union of Pure and Applied Physics, is an non-governmental
international organization, founded in 1922 with a mission to
assist in the worldwide development of physics, foster cooperation
and help in applying physics toward solving problems of concern
to humanity.

Pop Quiz - What time zone do they use at the South Pole?
Answer - They are supplied from McMurdo which is closest to New
Zealand, so they use New Zealand time.

*** Neutrino-Nucleus worksop Mainz, Germany, 12-23 May
</H1> <P>
"Neutrino–Nucleus Interactions in the Standard Model and Beyond,"
will be a 2-week program at MITP in Mainz that will focus on
advancing research in nu–nucleus interactions. The 1st week covers
theoretical discussions and collaborations; the 2nd week features
a workshop on nuclear modeling, cross section predictions, & their
implications for precision measurements.  Applications due 24 Jan.
