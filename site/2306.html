With 60,000 nu cascades
above 500 GeV, they obtain an excess of events in the galactic
plane at the level of 4.5 sigma.  For E_gamma &gt; 1 GeV, photons
from neutral pion decay in the plane of the galaxy are clearly
visible.  Nus from charged mesons are expected.  87% of the events
are atmospheric nus, 6% atmospheric muons, &amp; 7% the astrophysical
nu signal.

*** A journey to the DUNE experiment and the cost of neutrinos
</h1> <p>
Originally live and interactive, this YouTube video presents
the neutrino physics of DUNE in a quiz-show style.  A practical
question showed up in the comments, "How much does a neutrino
cost?...And are they priced differently for each of the three
types?"

*** Don Perkins, 1925-2022, "A force of nature"
</h1> <p>
I just became aware that Don Perkins, an early prominent advocate
of long-baseline experiments, passed away last October. Among many
other things, he played a leading role in Gargamelle, which helped
establish that neutrinos interact using neutral currents.

He often commented
on the newsletter, such as the July '03 comment that Lewis &amp; Clark
were looking for good sites for neutrino experiments, though they
didn't know it.  "Your message about Lewis &amp; Clark's search for
neutrino sites reminds me of a paper by Goldhaber and Nieto in Rev
Mod Phys (1971), about physical constants etc.  They pointed out
that the fact that Magellan's ships got around the world set a
limit on the photon mass around 500 years ago only about a factor
10**10 poorer than today's limit (~10**-27 eV). A finite photon
mass would have meant a deviation (a la Yukawa) from the inverse
square law, to be compensated by ring currents around the equator
which would have certainly screwed up Magellan's compasses. Also,
I could remark that, if the geomagnetic field had been only 4 or 5
times its present value, Kamiokande would not have found atmo nu
oscillations, since their cut-off would have reduced fluxes by an
order of magnitude, and neutrino energies would have been higher
and the oscillation length much longer. So the evidence would have
had to rest with SOUDAN 2 &amp; IMB at northerly latitudes. Since IMB
didn't support oscillations, God knows what would have happened!"

*** Don Perkins, the Higgs and theta-13
</h1> <p>
In December 2010, the final Oxford MINOS collaboration meeting took place,
and I ran into an ever-ebullient Don Perkins at the
elevator.  "How are things?" he asked.  Trying to match his
enthusiasm, I said, "Great! In the coming year we'll find the
Higgs and measure a non-zero value of theta-13."  He pointed his
finger at me and said "I'm going to hold you to it."  Now history
will record that both of these accomplishments happened in 2012,
but by October of 2011, many of us thought we knew the value of
theta-13 and the Higgs mass.  In March, before the July CERN
announcement, even comedian Stephen Colbert knew the Higgs mass.

The plan, to be fully implemented by 2025, will require all
published papers to be made available in the DOE repository.
There are 200,000 papers there now.  Neutrino papers can be

One of the items in the joint statement from the United States and
India when Prime Minister Modi visited the White House was PIP-II
and "$140 million in-kind contribution from the Indian Department
of Atomic Energy (DAE) to the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s)
Fermi National Laboratory toward collaborative development of the
Proton Improvement Plan-II Accelerator, for the Long-Baseline
Neutrino Facility"

P5 has wrapped up the town halls, and will now transition from the
information gathering phase to the deliberation phase with a goal
to deliver a report later this year. You can find a recent update:
