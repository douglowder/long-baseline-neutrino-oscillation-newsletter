*** CNGS commissioning starts
</h1>
By my count, the third long-baseline neutrino beam started its
commissioning on July 10th.  This beam goes from CERN in
Switzerland to the Gran Sasso Laboratory in Italy where the OPERA
experiment will measure numu to nutau oscillations.  The gradual
commissioning of the installation should result in the production
of a nominal beam during the month of August.   Beam spots are
visible at

*** MiniBooNE results soon?
</h1>
If MiniBooNE sees numu to nue oscillations with the same 2nu mixing
angle and mass difference squared as LSND (whatever that means),
they will have an excess of electron-like events, compared to
background, below 2 GeV.  For "Neutrino 2006", they opened their
"high energy box" and showed five 2-3 GeV data points where no
oscillations would be expected.   One point was a sigma high, one
a sigma low, and the other 3 agreed even better.  Their "box opening"
had been delayed, in part, by a ~60% disagreement between the absolute
normalization of the expected and observed numu events.   This has
been resolved by tuning the Monte Carlo to HARP data, using a
sophisticated "boosted decision tree" analysis, and numerous other
things.  Box opening and results are hopefully less than a month away.

*** PDG turns 50; Neutrino Mixing Section Modernized
</h1>
In July, the Particle Data Group turned 50.  As they do every two
years, a new issue of the particle listings, or "Review of
Particle Properties" has been issued.  The number one highlight is a
complete rearrangement of the neutrino listings, including a neutrino
mixing section that now contains measurements of the mixing angles and
mass differences in the three-neutrino framework.

*** Massive Neutrinos turn PDG's RPP into a phonebook
</h1>
RPP 2006 grew in page length by only 10%.  However, this publisher
uses paper that is 25-30% thicker than other publishers.  As
a result this edition looks enormous.  To make matters worse, they
used paper that is significantly wider and taller than the previous
edition.  The result is that it looks like a thick telephone book.

*** Intelligent Design of Neutrino Parameters
</h1>

S. Wojcicki showed neutrino parameters were designed in a way that
has worked well for the current generation of neutrino physicists.
Delta m^2_21 gives us a resonant MSW effect in the middle of the
solar energy spectrum.  Theta_12 is big enough to be seen in
KamLAND.  Delta m^2_32 gives full oscillation in the middle of the
range of atmospheric neutrino distances.  theta_23 is big enough
so that oscillations can be easily seen.  And theta_13 is small
enough so as not to confuse the interpretation of the other four
parameters.  But the acid test is - will theta_13 be big enough to
see CP violation and determine the mass hierarchy?

*** MINOS Horn fixed
</h1>
After a valve problem, the cooling nozzle on the NuMI first horn
was clogged with 1/2 mm resin beads.  Luckily, this was just
before the summer shutdown.  After nearly a month with repair
crews working 20-hour days, the problem was fixed.

*** Neutrinos in the News
</h1>
The August issue of Scientific American describes neutrinos as the
future of Fermilab in "The Neutrino Frontier: At Fermilab,
particle smashing yields to flavor changing."   The July 21 issue
of Science describes reactor neutrino experiments in "Neutrino
Hunters go Nuclear to Tackle Antimatter Deficit".

*** Accelerator panel concerned about support for muon cooling
</h1>
In its report to HEPAP, a subpanel on accelerators wrote "We are
concerned that the support for muon cooling is below what is
needed to sustain this program.  Support for MICE leaves little
for other R&amp;D Without increased support, essential intellectual
resources will disappear."
