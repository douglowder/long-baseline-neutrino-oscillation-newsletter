*** J-PARC accelerates to 30 GeV
</H1> <P>
The J-PARC 50-GeV Synchrotron (MR) has successfully accelerated 
the proton beams and extracted them to a beam dump.  The first 
beam commissioning started 22 Dec 08.  Next day, the beam was 
accelerated to 30 GeV, the target of the first stage of J-PARC, 
and was extracted to the abort beam dump intentionally. The MR is 
the 1st large accelerator with an imaginary transition energy.  
Preliminary results show that small beam loss occurred in 
the first few 100 ms, then no significant current drop observed 
until the extraction. The acceleration time was 2.5 seconds. The 
next step for the MR is the extraction to the hadron hall (Jan 09)
and to the neutrino beam line (Apr 09).

*** ANITA-2 launched
</H1> <P>
The ANITA-2 payload launched 21 Dec in calm conditions.  All 
systems are functioning well as they started taking RF triggers 
with the receivers on within 8 hours.  The ANtarctic Impulsive 
Transient Array (ANITA) is designed to study nus with E ~ 1e18 eV 
by detecting radio pulses from interactions with the Antarctic ice 
sheet. This is to be accomplished using an array of 32-40 radio 
antennas (cylindrically arranged with an approximate radius of 3m 
and a height of 5-7m) suspended from a helium balloon.

*** MiniBooNE nu_e appearance result with antineutrinos
</H1> <P>
MiniBooNE previously showed its neutrino results, but recently 
showed their results with 3.386e20 pot focusing for antineutrinos.

Their goal is 5e20.  Using a blind analysis for nu_mu to nu_e
antineutrino oscillations, the nu_e data was in agreement with 
Monte Carlo Background.  From 475-1250 MeV, 61 events with 
57.8 +-10 background.  No strong evidence for oscillations, limited 
by statistics.   There is also no evidence for the low energy 
excess, ruling out some explanations of the excess in neutrinos.

*** Award for MiniBooNE appearance result
</H1> <P>
The box was opened for a seminar on December 11th, 2008.  But the
speaker won an award for a poster describing the analysis in 
November before the box was opened.  Georgia Karagiorgi, an MIT 
graduate student, was named winner of the best poster presentation 
by the journal Nuclear Physics A at the 18th Particles and Nuclei 
International Conference in Eilat Israel.

*** Of Project Managers
</H1> <P>
Ron Ray, formerly deputy project manager for NOvA, is now project
manager for the proposed Fermilab mu2e project.  Cat James was 
made project manager for MicroBooNE.  Former MINOS project manager
Aesook Byon married former IMB physicist Bill Foster.

*** Neutrino Meetings, Jobs and Poems for 2009
</H1> <P>
The new year brings the updating of the neutrino meetings page
<A href="http://www.neutrinooscillation.org/numeetings.html"> 
http://www.neutrinooscillation.org/numeetings.html, </A>
to archive the
2008 meetings (see the bottom).  51 meetings were listed in 2008.  
There are also continuous updates at the neutrino jobs page,
<A href="http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/jobs/jobs.htm"> http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/jobs/jobs.htm, </A>
and, when there are 
contributions, such as "The Love of Tau", the neutrino poetry 
page,

*** APS Washington Meeting in Denver in 2009
</H1> <P>
One large meeting which includes nuclear and particle physics (and
hence neutrinos) is the APS Washington meeting.  But it hasn't 
been in Washington for many years, so to avoid confusion, the APS  
changed the name to the "April" meeting.  In 2009 this Denver
meeting will be in May.  In 2010, they will move it back to DC,
but it will be February 13-16.

*** Chinese Premier commends US-China collaboration
</H1> <P>
<A href="http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/breaking/2008/11/20/"> 
http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/breaking/2008/11/20/  </A>.
The Daya Bay 
Reactor Neutrino Experiment represents the major collaborative 
effort between the two nations. Currently under construction in 
China, Daya Bay will use anti-neutrinos produced by the reactors 
of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant and the Ling Ao Nuclear Power 
Plant to study theta-13.  Commissioning will begin in 2010.

*** Should Neutrino Telescopes look up or down?
</H1> <P>
Individual neutrinos carry no stamp of origin to distinguish 
whether they are produced as secondaries of cosmic-ray 
interactions in the atmosphere (atmospheric neutrinos) or by 
interactions of high energy particles in distant astrophysical 
sources.  It is generally assumed that the only signature of an 
astrophysical origin would be a significant number from the same 
direction or in coincidence with an event such as a GRB or a 
significant excess of high energy neutrinos above the flux of 
atmospheric neutrinos.  But Schonert et al. show they can suppress 
downward atmospheric neutrinos by vetoing the muon for energies > 
10 TeV with an efficiency > 99%.

*** EURONU Design Study at CERN in March
</H1> <P>
The first EURONU design study annual meeting will be at CERN in 
March.  
<A href="http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=42846"> 
http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=42846 </A>
The neutrino factory work package of EURONU DS represents the 
European contribution to IDS-NF so the next IDS-NF meeting will be 
held just before the annual meeting for EURONU DS.
