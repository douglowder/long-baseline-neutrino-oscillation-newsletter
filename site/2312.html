*** Report from The Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel
</h1> <p>
<a href="https://www.usparticlephysics.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/P5Report2023_120723-DRAFT_single-pages.pdf">

P5 was charged with developing a 10-year strategic plan for US
particle physics, in the context of a 20-year global strategy &amp; 2
constrained budget scenarios.  The report was organized into 3
science themes and 2 science drivers/theme.  In the baseline
budget scenario, for 2023-27, funding is as assumed in the 2022
CHIPS Act of 2022, followed by 3% increases each year.  The less
favorable scenario assumes 2% increases per year through 2033.
The Neutrino Frontier suggests that physicists endorse the P5
report.  Go to

*** P5 DUNE
</h1> <p>
The highest recommendation was to reaffirm the conclusions from
the previous P5 on the first phase of DUNE and PIP-II, as well as
NOvA, SBN and T2K.  DUNE was called the centerpiece of our program
to reveal the mysteries of neutrinos.  In the constrained
scenario, elements of DUNE would be delayed or descoped.  This
would negatively impact the US's international reputation in HEP.
The 2nd recommendation was to plan and start a list of programs
of which the 2nd priority was a re-envisioned second phase of
DUNE with an early implementation of an enhanced 2.1 MW beam, a
third far detector, and an upgraded near detector.  Besides the
six "recommendations", there were 18 "area recommendations", two
of which supported addressing Booster reliability risks through
the 1st 10 y of DUNE operation, and DOE funding of SURF expansion.

</p><h1>
*** P5 Ice-Cube
</h1> <p>
Ice-Cube-Gen2 was the 5th priority for study of nu properties
using non-beam nus complementary to DUNE, and for indirect high
mass Dark Matter searches using neutrinos as a tool.

</p><h1>
*** P5 Muon Collider
</h1> <p>
To invest in the future, Rec #4 proposes to support vigorous R&amp;D
toward a cost-effective 10 TeV pCM collider based on proton, muon,
or possible wakefield technologies, as well as a plan to improve
the FNAL accelerator complex including neutrinos, flavor, and a
10 TeV pCM collider.

</p><h1>
*** A theory with predictions for m1 and delta_CP
</h1> <p>
It is nice when a theory actually makes predictions and multiply
nice when it makes multiple predictions.  In
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14096"> arXiv:2312.14096, </a>
Babu, Mohapatra &amp; Thapa suggest a GUT based on the gauge symmetry
SU(5)_L x SU(5)_R with parity interchanging the two factor groups.
It predicts the CP phase to be ±(130.4 ± 1.2) deg and m1 = (4.8 −
8.4) meV.  There is no 0-nu 2-beta decay nor need for an axion.

</p><h1>
*** Countries sign MOU to contribute to the construction of DUNE
</h1> <p>
Brazil, Canada CERN, France, Italy, Switzerland and the UK have
signed a memorandum of understanding to provide hardware for the
1st 2 modules of DUNE.  Also expected are Spain &amp; Czech Republic.

*** Rant: Authorship issues:  Authors without borders
</h1> <p>
Experimental collaborations in particle physics each have a set of
authorship rules which, in my experience, tend to be egalitarian.
However, given the size and productivity of our colleagues, I
suspect that in our field on average we have not read a majority
of our own papers.  The Scientific Research Honor Society Sigma Xi
has prepared a study, "Authors Without Borders:  Guidelines for
Discussing Authorship with Collaborators", which addresses many of
the resulting issues.

*** DUNE cavern construction nearly complete
</h1> <p>
<a href="https://listen.sdpb.org/science/2023-12-20/massive-caverns-for-dune-neutrino-project-nearly-excavated">
https://listen.sdpb.org/science/2023-12-20/massive-caverns-for-dune-neutrino-project-nearly-excavated
</a>
With 800,000 tons of rock out of the way, two large caverns (20 m
wide, 151 m long, 28 m tall) for 4 ten kiloton fiducial detectors
should be complete in January 2024.  Cryostat installation is
expected to take two years each.

*** Neutrino 2024 to be 17-22 June 2024
</h1> <p>
The first bulletin of Neutrino 2024 announces the dates (above)
with an evening Welcome Party on 16 June.  This conference is
jointly organized by the University of Milano – Bicocca, the
University of Milan and the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare
(INFN). The event will take place in Milan, with the main venue at
the University of Milano.

*** Vertical Drift Technology for DUNE's second cryostat
</h1> <p>
The plan DUNE's 2nd detector is to use vertical drift technology.
The technical design (TDR) for a liquid argon detector using this
technology is available at
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03130"> arXiv:2312.03130. </a>
A design report
for the cryostats can be found at
