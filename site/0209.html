*** New neutrinos - MiniBooNE starts run
</h1>
The <a href=
"http://www.fnal.gov/pub/presspass/press_releases/miniboone.html"> 
MiniBooNE 
</a>
experiment at Fermilab has started taking data
to confirm or refute the numubar to nuebar signal from LSND.
They are looking for numu to nue oscillations using primary beam
from the Fermilab Booster.  With the start of beam come the first 
neutrino events.  They identified neutrinos that created 
ring-shaped flashes of light in 250,000-gallons of mineral oil.

*** New approval for ICARUS long-baseline experiment
</h1>
The CNGS neutrino beam from CERN to Gran Sasso is being built, 
and the ICARUS 600 ton detector will be installed early next year 
at Gran Sasso. Now Proposal CERN/SPSC 2002-027 (P-323) has been
recommended by the CERN SPSC. "The Committee congratulated the 
Collaboration for the very successful operation of the T600 
module demonstrating very long tracks and excellent performance. 
The Committee appreciated the proposed use of the CNGS beam and 
recommends the experiment for approval in consultation with the 
Grand Sasso Scientific Committee."  They asked for details on 
timelines, manpower and finances to run by 2006.

*** New (low energy) Solar Neutrino Experiments - why they are needed
</h1>
1. >99% of the predicted spectrum lies below 1 MeV.  2. Do unique 
tests of the simplified scenarios that we work with by testing 
them at low energies instead of 8B neutrino energies. We need CC 
and nu-e scattering experiments. 3. Measure mixing angle better.
4.  Test for CNO neutrinos. (Hans Bethe thought they would be 
dominant, but Bahcall's model says only 1.5% of the luminosity.)

<p> <h1>
*** New Spokespeople for Neutrino Factory Collaboration 
</h1>
Steve Geer (Fermilab) and Bob Palmer (Brookhaven) were elected 
co-spokespersons for the Nu Factory/Mu Collider Collaboration.  

<p> <h1>
*** New Minoan
</h1>
MINOS collaborator Tass Belias is the happy father a a baby girl 
born on 6th September in Herakleion Crete (once ruled by MINOS).

<p> <h1>
*** A comment that might not be useful.
</h1>
Asked whether there would be a positive signal from MiniBooNE, 
Gordon Kane said, "I don't think there is any theorist who can 
make a useful comment."

<p> <h1>
*** A comment on Fermilab and NuMI from the US House
</h1>
"The (Science) Committee is concerned about the difficulties being 
experienced with the luminosity upgrade of the Tevatron and with 
the Neutrinos at the Main Injector, both projects at Fermi 
National Accelerator Laboratory.  The Committee expects the 
Department and the laboratory to exercise aggressive project 
management to bring these projects back on schedule, and to do so 
within the funds available for High Energy Physics."  But NuMI 
excavation is complete, and the most recent milestones are ahead 
of schedule.  A contract for Service Buildings & outfitting has 
been awarded with a 13-month schedule for completion.

*** A Comment for Neutrino Physics from a US President
</h1>
According to columnist George Will, former US President Ronald 
Reagan said "Throw Deep" when approving the SSC.  350 Scientists 
met at the Washington Hilton last month and mentally changed it 
to "Go Deep" as plans for a National Underground Physics Lab were 
discussed at the 
<a href="http://www.physics.umd.edu/ness02/"> 
NeSS </a>
meeting (for Neutrinos and Subterranean 
Science).   While the main focus was on neutrinos, the far 
ranging meeting discussed other opportunities from proton decay 
to national security to sub-surface microbiology.

<p> <h1>
*** NFAC input
</h1>
The Neutrino Facilities Advisory Committee (to the National 
Research Council) has met to draft its final report.  They were 
asked for input on ICE-cube and the National Underground Lab, but 
reportedly will also comment on the scientific merit of many 
other neutrino and underground physics initiatives.  See

<p> <h1>
*** Nobel poll
</h1>
Nobel prizes come out in October, and it should be inevitable 
that neutrino oscillations be the justification for one or more
prizes. Should they give one year's prize for solar neutrinos and 
another one for atmospheric neutrinos?  Or just 1?  With 3 MNS 
angles, this newsletter would like to report 2 prizes soon and 
1 later.  Could Davis and others get a Chemistry prize?  Super-K
and SNO have both been great.  Whoever wins, our new understanding 
of the neutrino is based on worldwide efforts and talent.

*** Michael Turner slams John Updike
</h1>
At 
NESS02, Turner emphasized that <a href="http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~emma/poetry/updike.html"> 
John Updike </a>
was wrong in his 
1963 poem that "Neutrinos ... have no mass at all".  But wasn't
he right within the systematic errors taught in most Physics for 
Poets classes?  As for poetry for physicists, a call for neutrino 
haiku by this newsletter received no entries (yet).  But
see 
<a href="http://www.phys.washington.edu/~superk/neutrinohaiku.txt"> 
this one.
