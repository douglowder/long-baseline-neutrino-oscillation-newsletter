*** Neutrino Discussions for Europe at CERN

At a
CERN meeting, several possible future scenarios for support of nu
research in Europe were considered.  From a summary talk about
the CERN plans, CERN offers a platform for neutrino detector R&amp;D,
will support this platform in an active way and will help WA104 &amp;
WA105 and others in this initial phase.  CERN will construct a
large neutrino test area (EHN1 extension) with charged beam
capabilities, available in 2016.  It will continue detailed
studies of a short-baseline neutrino beam at CERN and will assist
the EU neutrino community in its long term common plans.  The
European neutrino community will again discuss its plans at a
meeting of the ICFA neutrino panel in Paris in January.

*** MicroBooNE progress
</h1> <p>
MicroBooNE will be a 170 ton Liquid Argon neutrino detector in
the FNAL Booster beam which will determine if the MiniBooNE low
energy excess is due to photons or electrons.  It is also a step
toward the construction of massive LAr TPCs.  The wireplane and
cryostat are being assembled in the Dzero building.  The PMTs were
installed in Aug/Sep, and a fiber calibration system Sep-Oct.  The
wireplane will be finished and put into the cryostat soon.  The
building for MicroBooNE has been finished and will be ready to
receive the cryostat when it is done.

*** Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) progress
</h1> <p>
Muon ionization cooling is an essential technique for future
intense stored-muon-beam facilities such as nu factories and mu
colliders. An old idea, it has yet to be put to practice. MICE
aims to demonstrate 10% ionization cooling of a muon beam by its
interaction with low-Z absorber materials followed by restoration
of longitudinal momentum in short RF linacs. "Step IV," including
the 1st LH2 or LiH absorber cell sandwiched between two particle
tracking spectrometers, will constitute the first experimental
test of the technique and will provide important validations of
the physics models used in cooling-channel design simulations.
The first of two large superconducting spectrometer solenoids
needed for Step IV has recently been trained, mapped, and
delivered to RAL, and training of the second is under way, as is
that of the Focus Coils needed to provide the desired optics at
the absorber.  Step IV running is planned for 2014-15. In MICE
Step VI, including three absorbers and two short linacs, the
full range of ionization cooling optics and parameters will be
tested, towards the end of this decade.

*** TallBo tests of photon detectors
</h1> <p>
A team from Indiana University has successfully conducted tests of
their latest design for an ultraviolet photon detector system, as
the first users of the new "TallBo" liquid argon dewar facility at
Fermilab. This PD prototype is intended for the LBNE far detector,
where scintillation light will provide valuable timing information
for event reconstruction in a TPC. The team collected many days'
worth of cosmic ray events to evaluate the performance of their
system and help steer decisions for the final detector design.

*** Boris Kayser Celebrates
</h1> <p>
For years, if a physicist at Fermilab had a question about
neutrinos, he/she would ask Boris.  His retirement is not a cause
for celebration, but his career was celebrated at FNAL last month.

*** Congressional Record
</h1> <p>
At a hearing of the Subcommittee on Energy of the House Committee
on Science, Rep. Randy Hultgren (R-IL) posed several questions to
Patricia Dehmer, Acting Director of the Office of Science.  Dehmer
assured him that Fermilab will be at the forefront in working at
the intensity frontier.  She added, "we're looking forward to a
very good future for High Energy Physics and (FNAL)".  Hultgren
spoke of the importance of the Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment.

*** NOvA, the best looking collaboration
</h1> <p>
The National Supplemental Screening Program conducts medical tests
of DOE workers at U.S. National Labs.  For their web page, they
must have needed a picture of a good looking group of people,
since they chose a photo from a NOvA collaboration meeting, none of
which had ever heard of the NSSP.

*** PIP II
</h1> <p>
Pip is a cabin boy who goes crazy in Moby Dick.  It is also the
initials for the Proton Improvement Plan, i.e. efforts by FNAL's
accelerator division to increase the proton intensity for Fermilab
Intensity Frontier Experiments.  A less costly plan than Project X
for improving the intensity of the Fermilab Main Injector for
future neutrino experiments will be described at the Brookhaven P5
meeting in December and named  PIP II.
