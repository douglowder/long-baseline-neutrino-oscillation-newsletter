*** Two Argonne Workshops
</h1>
Two distinct neutrino workshops will be held at Argonne this spring.
A theory institute (with experimenters) "Trends in neutrino physics"
will be May 12-16.
<a href="http://www.neutrinooscillation.org/trends.html">
http://www.neutrinooscillation.org/trends.html </a>
A detector design workshop, the 2nd NuMI off-axis workshop
<a href="http://www.neutrinooscillation.org/offaxisworkshop.htm">
http://www.neutrinooscillation.org/offaxisworkshop.htm </a>
will be held (Fri-Sun) April 25-27.  Don't mix up these dates!

<p> </p><h1>
*** Two Argon Detector Ideas
</h1>
The LANNDD proposal (Liquid Argon Neutrino and Nucleon Decay
Detector) is for a large (~100kton) liquid argon detector to
search for nucleon decay and study neutrinos.  It is featured in
a letter of intent for a long-baseline experiment at Brookhaven.
Mini-lanndd is a design for a small version (5 kton) which has been
considered
<a href="http://arxiv.org/ftp/astro-ph/papers/0206/0206124.pdf">
(http://arxiv.org/ftp/astro-ph/papers/0206/0206124.pdf) </a>
for the NuMI medium energy beam at 730 km for theta_13.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Another Liquid Argon Detector
</h1>
Another idea (from K. McDonald) would place a 40-ton liquid argon
module off-axis in the near detector area of the FNAL NuMI beam.
The Chicago Cyclotron Magnet coils could give a 1 Tesla field in
2/3 of the detector, which would get 10^5 CC numu events per year.

<p> </p><h1>
*** One more Argon Detector
</h1>
After testing T600 in Pavia in 2001, ICARUS is preparing for
installation in LNGS Hall B.  An installation program was
approved by LNGS in February.  Cloning of T600 has been
recommended by LNGSSC and CERN-SPSC (for CNGS) to reach T3000.
The first T1200 module is funded and the design is ongoing.  CNGS
(Cern Neutrinos to Gran Sasso) start is now expected in May 2006.

<p> </p><h1>
*** KR2DET Reactor proposal to measure theta_13
</h1>
One detector reactor experiments have an accuracy in mixing angle
that is limited by systematic errors of a few percent.  If this
could be improved to better than 1% with 2 or more detectors, a
value of theta_13 could be measured down a factor of 10 from its
present limit.  A proposal has been made to do this at the
Krasnoyarsk Reactor, with two 46 ton detectors at 115 m and
1000 m from the reactor.  One advantage at Krasnoyarsk is that
there is a 600MWE overburden which reduces backgrounds.  Other
groups are also looking at other reactors and sites.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrino Oscillations and the age of the Earth
</h1>
The energy dependence of geoneutrinos can be used in KamLAND to
measure the Thorium to Uranium ratio.  Mohanty uses early data
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0302060"> hep-ph/0302060 </a>
to determine the age as a function of mixing
parameters.  In LMA-I it gets the right(?) answer 4.5 Gyears.
For the LMA-II solution, the age does not match at 99% CL.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Improvising neutrinos
</h1>
<a href="http://www.fuzzyco.com/productions/neutrino/">
http://www.fuzzyco.com/productions/neutrino/ </a>
The Neutrino Project, a cleverly named improvisational comedy
group, was presented 2/7/3 at Chicago's ImprovOlympic on N. Clark.

<p> </p><h1>
*** 2 more Underground Nu projects on DOE-OS Director Orbach list
</h1>
Besides 5 of 13 High Energy projects being related to neutrinos,
2 of the 9 nuclear physics projects on the list are next-
generation double beta decay (Majorana) and pp solar neutrino
detectors.  Within the next few weeks, Orbach will take the
facility recommendations and prioritize them.  He will do this
by himself because no committee has been able to successfully
prioritize across fields.  He described the "superb" support
there is for his office's programs, while acknowledging that
funding is not sufficient.  Draft report in March, final in May.

*** Neutrino Export Help Sought by Email
</h1>
I AM KUMAN UDAFL, SCIENCE DIRECTOR OF THE KNOWLEDGE LABORATORY IN
LAGOS NIGERIA.  WITH GREAT HUMILITY, I AM CONTACTING YOU ABOUT A
BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY THAT WILL BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO BOTH OF US.
A PREVIOUS RESEARCHER HAS LEFT 30,000,000 NEUTRINOS IN HIS
LABORATORY, BUT HAS UNFORTUNATELY DIED IN A RIVER ACCIDENT.
NEUTRINOS ARE KNOWN TO BE QUITE VALUABLE, AND WOULD TAKE AT LEAST
$10M(UNITED STATES DOLLARS) TO PRODUCE AT ANOTHER LABORATORY.  I
HAVE FOUND A BUYER FOR THESE NEUTRINOS FOR $2M.  I HAVE PERSONALLY
KEPT THIS INFORMATION SECRET TO ENABLE THE WHOLE PLANS AND IDEA BE
PROFITABLE AND SUCCESSFUL.  I NEED HELP FROM SOMEONE TO EXPORT
THESE NEUTRINOS AND OBTAIN A LICENSE.  I COULD DO THIS ALONE BUT
DUE TO MY POSITION AS A CIVIL SERVANT IT WOULD RAISE AN EYE BROW.
I WILL NOT FAIL TO INFORM YOU THAT THIS IS 100% RISK FREE. ON
CONCLUSION OF THIS TRANSACTION, YOU WILL BE ENTITLED TO 30% OF THE
TOTAL SUM AS GRATIFICATION.  5% WILL BE FOR EXPENSES AND ALSO
TELEPHONE BILLS, WHILE 65% WILL BE FOR MY LABORATORY.  PLEASE GET
BACK TO ME SOON STATING YOUR WISH IN THIS. YOURS FAITHFULLY, KU.
