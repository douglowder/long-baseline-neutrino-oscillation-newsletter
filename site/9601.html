*** ASPEN summer program on High Energy Neutrino Astrophysics
</h1>They are having a workshop May 27-June 9 1996.  The application
deadline is February 1! The workshop will follow Aspen format of
informality to maximize multi-party discussion and new initiatives.
The workshop will bring together particle physicists and
astro-physicists to brainstorm on the possibility of using high
energy cosmic ray neutrinos to do astronomy, astrophysics,
cosmology, and neutrino physics. It follows upon the Hawaii
HENA workshop of 1992.  Application information is available at:
http://andy.bu.edu/aspen/application/index.html;
An e-form is at:     http://andy.bu.edu/cgi-bin/aspenapp;
or contact: Tom Weiler,

*** NSF groups are hurting.  Tell congress your thoughts.
</h1>Research supported by the NSF has been damaged by the government
shutdowns, with no new grants issued for more than a month, 156 grants
cut off on Dec. 31 and 3000 proposals piled up in the mail room.  The
temporary budget for NSF expires on January 26, and by January 31,
300 more grants will have lapsed.  IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ALERT MEMBERS
OF CONGRESS ABOUT THE GRAVE CONSEQUENCES OF THE SHUTDOWN AND THE
CRITICAL NEED TO ESTABLISH A FULL 1996 APPROPRIATION FOR NSF.
In case no agreement is reached between the Administration and
Congress, NSF program directors are preparing for a 1996 OPERATING
BUDGET 25% BELOW THE 1995 LEVEL.  Such a scenario is yech.

*** KARMEN upgrade
</h1>KARMEN's upgrade is to install a 2nd veto layer against cosmic
neutrons from inelastic scatterings of cosmic muons in the KARMEN
bunker. The new veto will detect the muon and the more than 1 m iron
between the new shield and the central detector will absorb most high
energy neutrons from DIS as the attenuation length is 21.6 cm in iron.
This design (tested with GCALOR and GEANT) requires the nearly complete
dismantling of the 7000 t blockhouse, then the installation of 300 m**2
of plastic scintillator (with module sizes of 3.2 m up to 4.0 m and a
width of .65 m) read out by 1100 two-inch tubes. Dismantling has
already started, and scintillator production at BICRON has just started
(though delayed by the 'sudden death' of Nucl. Enterprises at Edinburgh
- another one of those takeover things bringing the end to a traditional
manufacturer..., unfortunately large customers for scintillator are
virtually non-existent), but all action should be completed by fall this
year. Karmen with then run 2 more years with significantly reduced
cosmogenic background in order to reach a sensitivity of sin**2(2 theta)
= 1.0-1.5 x 10**(-3) and to completely cover the LSND-hint area.

*** In the Times and the FAZ
</h1>Some say you've not been born, died or married unless you read it
in the Times.  MINOS made it to the (London) Times October 9th
which wrote, "This definitive experiment will cost $135 million
and won't produce results before the end of the century even if
the money can be found.  But the implications for physics,
astronomy and cosmology are so huge that it would be a great pity
if it wasn't done".  The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, one of
Germany's leading daily newspapers wrote on January 3rd, "The
great interest for neutrinos was documented recently by a committee
of the DOE. The experts recommended strong support of further
experiments in the USA...the production site would be the proton
accelerator in Chicago which is 730 km's away."

*** Speaking of births
</h1>There's a new generation at Oxford.   Jenny Thomas, just
reelected to the MINOS executive committee, has had a
daughter, "Indiana" 6 lbs 13 oz, 26 December.  Both are doing
well, but are noisy at night.

*** "New Theory:  Neutrinos Cause Cancer" headline in Boston
</h1>Really.  The idea, reported in the New Scientist, is that
supernovas within 20 light years could produce 12 cancerous cells
per kilogram of living tissue.  The impact would be greater on
larger animals like dinosaurs because they have more tissue.
This "may have produced a cancer pandemic among dinosaurs" says
the Boston Globe, 1/11/96.  Two related preprints are listed
below.  Whatever the case, this kind of publicity we don't like.

*** New Machine for Long-Baseline at KEK
</h1>The JHP(Japan Hadron Project) Working Group has recommended
that a 50 GeV machine be built at KEK. This facility will have
an intensity per pulse about 10 times that of the Fermilab
Main Injector.  It will be a 50 GeV proton synchrotron, a 3 GeV
booster and a 200 MeV linac.  This interdisciplinary machine
will be for both high energy and nuclear physicists.  At a
workshop in December, there were talks on the next generation
of rare K decay experiments, heavy ion experiments, hypernuclei
experiments, and spectroscopy, in addition to long-baseline
neutrino oscillation experiments.  A talk on Minos was given
by Yunsil Ho of Columbia University and one on long-baseline nu
oscillations using this facility was given by Nishikawa of KEK.
The facility is not formally approved but physics brass in
Japan were confident in machine construction by 2002-3.

*** Vax migration at Fermilab
</h1>Fermilab will turn off all vax user accounts on July 1, 1996
except those whose request for extension has been approved.
Since the Soudan experiment remains wedded to vaxes, this could
be a problem for some in the MINOS collaboration.  If you already
have a VAX account, you can get a UNIX account by email to
.  Ask for a computer account request and point
out that you have already signed the "proper use" form.

*** BLIZZARD DELAYS COSMOS/MINOS R&amp;D FUND REQUESTS
</h1>Due to the Big East Coast blizzard, DOE/NSF meetings with MINOS on
January 10th and COSMOS on January 11th were postponed for about
a month.  Both collaborations need some support for detector
development, as it is unlikely equipment funds will be available
before FY98.  R&amp;D plan documents were prepared by both groups for
this meeting, which is now scheduled for Feb. 1.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Other upcoming meetings
</h1>The Neutrino Telescopes Workshop is Feb 27-29 in
Venice; contact .; Lake Louise Winter
Institute topics in Electroweak Physics is 18-24 at Chateau Lake
Louise, contact .  At the Washington APS
meeting in Indianapolis, May 2-5, both the DNP and DPF will have
invited sessions featuring neutrino oscillation experiments.
Neutrino '96 is 13-19 June in Helsinki; neutri96@
