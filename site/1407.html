*** Neutrino Summit held at Fermilab
</h1> <p>
A number of leaders of the international neutrino community were
invited to a two-day summit at Fermilab to discuss the creation
of a new international collaboration to fulfill the P5 goals for
a long-baseline neutrino facility (LBNF).  This process is the
reformulation of LBNE.  A next step is the creation of an interim
international Executive Board (iiEB) which will appoint some working
groups to help define the process and collaboration moving forward.

Rob Roser from Fermilab and Ken Long from Imperial College London
are helping to guide the process.

*** NOvA dedication upon complete construction of far detector
</h1> <p>
At a ceremony in July, NOvA "cut the cake" to celebrate the
completion of the 14 kiloton far detector to study neutrinos in
a long-baseline experiment along the NuMI beam in Ash River MN.
The near detector is also nearing completion and the first results
are expected in early 2015.  NOvA has now seen neutrinos in every
"superblock" allowing it to check off the conditions for CD4.
Then NOvA transitions from a construction project to operations.

*** APPEC statement from meeting on Large Neutrino Infrastructures
</h1> <p>
The agencies &amp; lab directors gathered at the International Meeting
on Large Neutrino Infrastructures agreed that the understanding of
the neutrino sector is a worldwide priority promising physics
in a unified theoretical framework that goes from the Electroweak
Scale to the highest energy scales.  Furthermore, this program is
complementary to neutrino related measurements made in cosmology
and provides crucial input to the knowledge of neutrinos.  They
supported the P5 vision proposing Fermilab host short- and long-
baseline experiments.  CERN recently approved a medium-term plan
including hosting a neutrino platform for R&amp;D and prototyping the
next generation of neutrino detectors as the main CERN investment
to the development of a worldwide program.

*** Hyper-K makes top 27, not top 10  (in MEXT draft roadmap)
</h1> <p>
Despite overlap with a Hyper-Kamiokande meeting in Vancouver, a
number of their leaders attended the neutrino summit.  They
reported complementarity of physics and two large neutrino detectors
makes the global neutrino program more fruitful.  Previously, the
Science Council of Japan had selected Hyper-K as a top priority
project (27 chosen out of 192 in all of science.)  In the MEXT
draft roadmap, 10 of the 27 were selected for funding now, not
including Hyper-K.  They were asked to improve International
Participation, Organization and their cost estimate.  The next
revision of the roadmap will be in 2017, which does not delay HK.
The budget request was planned for 2017, and there is time to
address the issues raised.

*** Fermilab Neutrino Division Created
</h1> <p>
In a reorganization by new Fermilab Director Nigel Lockyer, a
Neutrino Division has been established to emphasize the importance
of neutrinos to the future of Fermilab.  There had previously been
a Neutrino Department in the Particle Physics Division.  The new
division will be led by Gina Rameika.  The Division will start
small and grow as the short- and long-baseline program matures.

*** LBNE statement supports P5
</h1> <p>
The LBNE collaboration issued as statement supporting the P5
recommendations and the evaluation of all options to optimize
the scientific reach of a new international LBNF.

*** JUNO International Collaboration established
</h1> <p>
The JUNO neutrino experiment will be  located at Kaiping, a small
city in the south of China, 200 km from Hong Kong. The 20kt liquid
scintillator detector will be in an underground cavern at a depth
of about 700 m.  It will study the shape of the energy distribution
leading to the mass hierarchy.  The 200+ member collaboration has
scientists from China, Czech, France, Finland, Germany, Italy,
Russia and the U.S.  Yifang Wang is the spokesperson and Marcos
Dracos is chair of the Institutional Board.
