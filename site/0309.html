Long-Baseline news, September 2003</h1>

<h1>
*** Salty SNO Box Opened</h1>
The salt phase of SNO is now complete. 254 days of data have been analyzed
with 150 to go. Data qualitatively agrees well with before. LMA I is selected,
with LMA-II only remaining at 99.7%CL. Maximal mixing ruled out at 5.4
sigma, the best fit now at 7.1 10^-5 eV^2 and theta 32.5 degrees. See <a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/nucl-ex/0309004">nucl-ex/0309004</a>
<h1>
*** Year Long US Neutrino Study</h1>
The Division on Nuclear Physics (DNP) and Division of Particles and Fields
(DPF) of the APS along with the Division of Astrophysics (DAP) and Division
of Particle Beams (DPB) are jointly sponsoring a neutrino study for the
next year.&nbsp; Boris Kayser and Stuart Freedman will be leading the study,
which will aim at identifying the upcoming physics challenges for neutrino
physicists. A report will presumably be written by the end of next summer.
<h1>
*** KamLAND rates down</h1>
KamLAND is (presumably) measuring less neutrino events than earlier, not
because neutrino oscillation has increased over time, but because many
Japanese reactors have shut down for inspection as a result of concerns
over safety lapses and inaccurate information. In May of 2003, the Japanese
nuclear industry was operating at 37% of total capacity.
<h1>
*** Studying Supernovae in Tennessee</h1>
The SNS**2 workshop was for Supernova Neutrino Studies at the SNS. They
are investigating putting some liquid or solid detectors 21 m from the
beam stop. They could measure neutrino cross sections from a variety of
nuclear targets, of interest to supernova dynamics. A lead target would
be of interest to the OMNIS project.
<h1>
*** Universe might end, NuMI to continue</h1>
Some superstitious cosmologists pointed out back in 1998 that the prospect
of a Cubs-Red Sox World Series (baseball) coupled with the curse of the
Billy Goat and the curse of the Bambino meant that the universe must end
before the final out of the 7th game October 28th. The project manager
for Neutrinos at the Main Injector has decided not to let the current frequentist
probability of such a match-up (1/16~6%) delay the project.
<h1>
*** NuMI proton intensity</h1>
The MINOS proposal calls for 2 yrs of running NuMI at 3.7x10^20 pot, although
only 2 x10^20 pot/yr is now expected for the 2005 start. MINOS has proposed
that Fermilab spend ~10M$/yr to upgrade the beam intensity to 7.2x10^20
pot by 2009, yielding 25x10^20 for a 5 yr run beginning in 2005. This can
possibly be achieved by multi-bunch stacking in the Main Injector and faster
cycle times with increased magnet and RF power. These issues are being
studied by a Fermilab Committee chaired by David Finley.
<h1>
*** Particle Physics with Particle Board</h1>
The P929 NuMI Off-Axis collaboration is writing a proposal for the fall
Fermilab PAC meeting. A committee recently made a working decision to write
the proposal with liquid scintillator as the baseline for the active detector,
with resistive plate chambers as the alternative. The passive part of the
detector will be (~7") particle board. A 50 kT detector is envisaged.
<h1>
*** Seesaw meeting, Paris June 10-11, 2004</h1>
Arrive early for Neutrino 2004 and for an international conference on the
Seesaw Mechanism and the Neutrino Mass at Institut Henri Poincare, Paris,
June 10-11, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the seesaw mechanism.

<h1>
*** NOVE II - Venice December 3-5, 2003.</h1>
The Second International Workshop on: NO-VE "Neutrino Oscillations in Venice"
will be held in Venice at the "Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti",
to discuss the impact of recent results and to chart the direction of future
research.
<h1>
*** JPARC delayed, neutrinos accelerated</h1>
The Japanese Particle Research Center, JPARC, also known as JHF, is being
funded by JAERI (nuclear funding) and KEK (particle funding). Due to JAERI's
tight budget, the Minister of MEXT (Ministry of Education, etc. and Technology)
proposed: A. to complete J-PARC by the end of JFY07 (one year delay) and
B. to start the neutrino program from the next FY (5 year funding term).
This is positive for the neutrino program which wasn't previously approved
as part of Phase-I of JPARC.
