*** 2023 long range plan for nuclear science released
</H1> <P>

RECOMMENDATION 2 is "As the highest priority for new experiment
construction, we recommend that the US lead an international
consortium that will undertake a neutrinoless double beta decay
campaign, featuring the expeditious construction of ton-scale
experiments, using different isotopes and complementary
techniques."  The plan endorses CUPID, nEXO and LEGEND-1000.
The report is a vision for nuclear physics for the next 5-10 y.

*** NuPHYS2023: Prospects in Neutrino Physics 18-20 December
</H1> <P>
The first NuPHYS after the pandemic will take place at King's
College in London.  
<A href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/1234324/">

To encourage and facilitate the participation of early-career
researchers and PhD students, a poster session will be a key
activity of the meeting.

<H1>
*** NuSTEC summer School, 5-13 June 2024 at CERN
</H1> <P>
The next installment of this summer school, focused on neutrino-
nucleus scattering, will take place at CERN in June.

*** MicroBooNE kinematic variable analysis for QE interactions
</H1> <P>
Using new kinematic imbalance variables, in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06082"> arXiv:2310.06082, </A>
MicroBooNE has shown that GENIE version 2 is inadequate to
describe the data.  From 6.79e20 protons on target, 250,000
neutrino interactions on argon were studied.  GiBUU agrees
particularly well in areas of phase space where final state
interactions have a very large effect.

<H1>
*** MicroBooNE decommissioning completed
</H1> <P>
In October, the argon was all vented which was the last step
in decommissioning.  Samples were sent for analysis of
contaminants and for radiological purity.  Some parts are
going to be used by SBND, ICARUS, and the DUNE 2x2 detector.

<H1>
*** TRIDENT chooses site for neutrino detector
</H1> <P>

"The Tropical Deep-sea Neutrino Telescope (TRIDENT), nicknamed
Hai-Ling in Chinese ('ocean bell'), is a planned 7.5 km^3 nu
detector sited in the South China Sea near the equator.  The
detector contains 1,211 strings, each with 20 hDOMs separated
vertically by 30 m, and ranging from ~ 2,800-3,400 m underwater.

*** Ice-Cube reconstruction Kaggle Competition results
</H1> <P>

Ice-Cube sponsored an open competition to predict a neutrino's
direction based on data from the IceCube detector, which observes
the cosmos from deep within the South Pole ice.  6,460 people
registered, of which 901 from 74 countries turned in a valid
solution.  See 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15289"> arXiv:2307.15289. </A>
The top 3 solutions are shown
in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15674"> arXiv:2310.15674. </A>

*** Neutrino running at J-PARC to resume in late November
</H1> <P>

Beam had been disrupted due to a June fire in the Hadron Power
Supply Building. There had been no leaked radioactive material,
no radiation exposures, & no injuries.  Meanwhile, upgraded ND280
detectors have been installed. 2 Time-of-Flight detectors were
installed in July. The bottom High-Angle TPC was delivered to
J-PARC in August and successfully installed in September. They
the SuperFGD was planned for install in Oct. with 1st data soon.

<H1>
*** Neutrino running at Fermilab to resume ?
</H1> <P>
At a safety all hands meeting, asked when the accelerator would
resume, interim CSO Marc Clay said that they needed to update
the Safety Assessment Document (SAD) & Accelerator Safety Envelope
(ASE).  There is a phased approach for document updates.  The goal
is to resume running in early February 2024. (Booster & 8 GeV)

<H1>
*** Predicting the neutrino mixing angles with HVM
</H1> <P>
It would be nice if a theory could predict the mixing angles.
Along the way, it would be nice to have some models which make
such predictions.  One which does is the Hierarchical VEVs model
in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12915"> arXiv:2310.12915  </A>
which predicts the sines of the angles as (12)
0.55 +- 0.00134, (23) 0.775 +- 0.00067, and (13) 0.1413-0.1509.

<H1>
*** LBNF/DUNE Central Utility Cavern Excavation Complete
</H1> <P>
The Central Cavern, which will be used for power, liquid argon
processing, etc. for the 4 DUNE modules, is complete.  The cavern
has a concrete slab which is in place at the 90% level.  Detector
installation will commence in 2024 with first science in 2028.

<H1>
*** Accessing a discussion of Fermilab access
</H1> <P>
The Fermilab calendar mentioned a session on site access on
26 October.  (Web page no longer exists.)  The time was given but
no location.  Zoom was "available", but no zoom info was provided.
