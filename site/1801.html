*** Alex Radovic presents new NOvA results at Fermilab
</h1> <p>
Now with 8.85e20 POT (14-kton equivalent), NOvA has 50% more beam
than in the 2016 analysis.  They have improved the analysis by tuning
energy bins, retuned cross section modeling, improved simulation
and used data driven NuMI flux estimates developed by MINERvA.
They expect 763 numu events (no oscillations) and see 126.
Delta m^2_32 is 2.444e-03 eV^2 +- 0.08.  The upper octant is
preferred at 0.2 sigma, sin^2(q_23) = 0.558+0.041-0.033 upper,
0.475+0.036-0.044 lower, octant.  The previous analysis had
suggested non-maximal mixing.  Rejection of maximal has changed
from 2.6 sigma to 0.8 sigma.  For electron neutrino appearance,
NOvA sees 66 events with 20.5 BG.  48 signal would be expected for
delta = 1.5pi normal order; 20 for 0.5pi, inverted.  The inverted
order is almost rejected at 2 sigma.
NOvA is currently running with antineutrinos.

*** Alex Himmel presents new NOvA results at CERN

presented the new NOvA results at CERN (same as above).

*** Alex Sousa proposing NOvA test beam
</h1> <p>
Alex Sousa from the University of Cincinnati is leading an effort
to put two 2x2 31 plane NOvA blocks in a test beam at the Fermilab
Test Beam Facility.  A tertiary beam with momenta 0.2-2 GeV/c
could improve models of hadronic and em response and reduce energy
scale uncertainties.   A November presentation estimated running
could take place at MC7 Jan-Jun 2019.

*** Alex Friedland and Supernova SNOBS and solar nus
</h1> <p>
SLAC's Alex Friedland is one of the world's experts on Supernova
nus.  At the SNOBS workshop (Supernova Neutrino Observations) he
gave a talk on non-standard neutrino physics accessible from SNs.

</a>
He has also discussed the observation of solar neutrinos with
another Alex, Alexander Booth from Sussex.

*** Alexander Hamilton and neutrinos
</h1> <p>
As far as we know, Lin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote the hit Alexander
Hamilton, is not planning a hip-hop show about neutrinos.  But
Professor neutrino creates music at the spectrum's edge.

*** What does Alexa know about neutrinos?
</h1> <p>
I asked my new Amazon Echo what the mass of the neutrino was, but
someone else heard a different answer to a similar question.
They were told 5.7e-37 kg which probably came from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino#Mass ">
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino#Mass
</a>
which says 320 meV.
Forward to me any question and answer that seems interesting.

*** Secretary of Energy hit by neutrinos.  Did he hit back?
</h1> <p>

In a January visit to Fermilab, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry
stood in a neutrino beam.  "I think I got hit by a whole bunch of
neutrinos, he said 'Stand right here sir.' " (8:35 on the video)
He also solicited questions about neutrinos (24:30).  At Argonne
the same day he noted the preponderance of Italians at FNAL,
possibly because he heard the words neutrino &amp; Fermi so much.

*** Record neutrino power at J-PARC
</h1> <p>
(From J-PARC Newsletter 69)  The neutrino experimental facility
ran October - December for T2K.  Recently the beam power reached
a new record value, 475 kW. The beam is stable in the operation with
anti-neutrino mode. The accumulated POT is  3.8x10^20 as of Dec. 20.
In the spring to summer 2018 run they aim to double the
antineutrino statistics for electron neutrino appearance studies.

The Fermilab Office of
Communication has created a new page for the media and public to
find information about LBNF and DUNE.

*** Frustrating physics

</a>
According to an article in the magazine "The Economist", the
lack of nucleon decay at Super-K is as frustrating as the
failure to find super-symmetry.
