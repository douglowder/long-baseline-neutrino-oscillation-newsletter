*** Super-Kamiokande reports  neutrino mass is non-zero
</h1>
In an announcement at Neutrino '98, Super-Kamiokande described
its very strong evidence that neutrino oscillations are needed to
explain their atmospheric neutrino data.  See
www.phys.washington.edu/~superk/sk_release.html.  Data from their
contained events, partially contained events, Multi-Gev events,
upward muons and upward stopping muons all differ from
expectation but can be explained with large mixing and delta
msquared of a few times 10**-3.  Watch for two New York Times
articles starting with the front page of the Friday June 5 issue.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Super-Kamiokande; contained events, zenith, neutral current
</h1>With 535 days of data, Super-Kamiokande has 3032 1-ring events,
1018 2-ring, 426 &gt;2-ring, and 301 partially contained events(PCE).
Expected were 3223, 1076, 465 and 372.  The Sub-GeV R is 0.627 +-
.026 +- .05 and the Multi-Gev value is .647 +- .049 +- .078.  The
zenith angle distribution fits nicely to 5 10**-3 eV^2 with
sin^2 theta=1 for the sub-GeV, Multi-GeV and PCE data.  If there
was a problem with the neutrino flux, it might show up in the
(neutral current) pi0 events.  But [pi0/e)(data)]/[pi0/e(MC)] is
0.94 +- .08(stat) +- 0.03(MC-stat) +- 0.19(syst)

<p> </p><h1>
*** more Super-Kamiokande results; azimuthal angle, upware mus
</h1>Neutrino Oscillations can cause zenith angle changes, but not
azimuth angle changes for contained events.  Noticable azimuth
effects are expected from geomagnetic effects for certain
energies.  Effects are seen as expected, giving confidence that
the measured zenith angle anomalies are real.  Upward muons and
upward stopping muon angular distributions provide two more
independent data sets to study for oscillation effects.  Analysis
of both data sets gives a poor chi-squared without oscillations
and a good chi-squared when large mixing and 5 10**-3 eV^2 numu
to nutau oscillations are put in.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Japanese budget cuts threaten Super-Kamiokande operations.
</h1>Due to the financial difficulty of the Japanese government,
operating funds for Super-Kamiokande have been reduced by 15% for
1998.  This may require them to cease operation for 2 months.  An
additional 15% cut is expected next year.  Under these
circumstances, they will have to stop the operation of the
experiment,probably for 4 months.  These cuts are being applied
equally, across-the-board, to all institutions, without
consideration of the relative scientific importance of the
projects or the devastating impact that such cuts may have.

<p> </p><h1>
*** K2K schedule
</h1>K2K will turn on at 0001 on Jan 1, 1999 (Japanese time), using a
fast spill.  They will run 3-5 months, being off during the
summer and slow spill at KEK.   Super-Kamiokande plans to empty
during the summer of 1999 to replace some tubes.   The K2K run is
expected to take 3 years with 6 months of running per year.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Soudan 2 flavor ratio still low
</h1>Soudan 2 now has double the fiducial exposure of the Frejus
experiment.  From 3.56 fiducial kiloton years, the neutrino flavor
ratio is 0.58 +/- 0.11 +/- 0.06.  Soudan 2 has isolated a sample
of nu-mu flavor events for which the resolution in L/Enu for
incident neutrinos is excellent, as the result of imaging of
the recoiling hadronic system. In this sample of events, with Enu
between 0.5 to 2.0 GeV, the nu-mu flux appears depleted in both
down-going as well as up-going neutrinos.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Diablo Avocado still skeptical (but mellowing?) about nu-osc
</h1>While he cannot find anything wrong with the Super-Kamiokande
analysis, Diablo Avocado is still skeptical about neutrino
oscillations. Why are the parameters so conveniently those that
show up in atmospheric neutrinos where we have no control over
the beam?  Why maximal mixing?  He will be watching the
long-baseline results with great interest, although it now appears
that they will not be able to completely rule out Super-K if they
come out negative.

<p> </p><h1>
*** MINOS tubes held hostage by NASA
</h1>MINOS has a choice between an existing Hamamatsu phototube, and
a newer 61-ch tube being prototyped by DEP, which was ordered for
testing many moons ago.  The package finally came, but inside was
a Power Supply.  Customs people said that by mistake NASA has
MINOS' DEP tubes and MINOS has their Power Supply. The Power
Supply is sent back.  Does NASA do the same?  Nooooo-ooh. (Try
that a la Bill Murray) NASA told the customs people that they will
not even begin to send the tubes back to be sent to MINOS until
they get their Power Supply ... due to "government regulations".

<p> </p><h1>
*** CERN research board hears about neutrino momentum
</h1>At their April 1998 meeting, it was reported the SPSC felt that
TOP, a proposal for a TOSCA prototype was now premature.  It was
also reported that the INFN had included a sizeable fraction of
the cost of the Gran Sasso neutrino beam in its next 5-year plan
which is to be be discussed in the coming months.  This new beam
was thus gathering momentum.
