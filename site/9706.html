*** CERN moves towards long-baseline beams</h1>
The SPS committee at CERN has favored the long-baseline
option towards Gran Sasso over future intermediate baseline
experiments in the JURA mountains.   It is anticipated that
much of the funding for the beam would be provided by Italy
and others.  "...in view of future competition, the neutrino
beam (towards Gran Sasso should) be promptly constructed".
This also implies that a future short-baseline experiment,
TOSCA, would be in the same beamline and located in the
near detector which is close to the airport.   Long-baseline
experiments (plural) at Gran Sasso are desired.  ICARUS is
clearly one, but more massive experiments were also thought
desirable.  CERN management has agreed.  Individual proposals
and further funding negotiations will have to be worked on
before a real schedule is put forth.

*** Neutrinos from Hell (1)</h1>
The paper of Oyama et al (below) compares upward muons in Kamioka
with high energy contained electron showers (&gt;20 GeV).   Since
muons above this energy do not decay in the atmosphere before
hitting the earth, and there are numus from pi decay, the numu
to nue ratio at this energy is much greater than 2.  That makes
the measurement of this ratio very sensitive to numu-&gt;nue
oscillations.  They've looked, seen the expected ratio, and can
rule out a large amount of the same parameter space that the
reactor experiments are studying.

*** Neutrinos from Hell (2)</h1>
MACRO continues to have a strange angular distribution from
its neutrino induced upward muons, with less muons than
expected in the most upward bin, and a much smaller deficit
at other upward angles.  This effect, which was noticed
in earlier data, has grown.  The observed flux doesn't match
the expected flux, but putting in oscillations, while improving
the fit, still does not describe the data.  A careful search
for possible systematic errors has not led to a solution.

*** Neutrinos from Hell (3)</h1>
If the large mixing angle solution to the solar neutrino
problem is correct, there is regeneration of solar nus in the
earth.  The "neutrino sky" would be brighter night than day.

*** Fire</h1>
A fire at the CERN SPS delayed this year's neutrino running of
CHORUS and NOMAD by about a month, but the run time will be
increased to make up for it.

*** Brimstone</h1>
Well concrete, actually, is flaking from top floors of Fermilab's
high rise.  $30M repairs are needed on the same timescale that
MINOS construction funds are planned.

<p> </p><h1>
*** BOONE == BOOster Neutrino Experiment</h1>
BOONE is a new proposal at Fermilab to use a liquid scintillator
detector together with a neutrino beam from Fermilab's 8 GeV
booster.  The goal would be to conclusively cover the entire
region of parameter space suggested by the LSND experiment.
A description of the project is available under "Neutrino
Physics with the Fermilab Booster" at
http://www.fnal.gov/projects/numi/workshop/summaries/summaries.html

*** Laughing at neutrinos</h1>
On their way from Fermilab to MINOS, neutrinos will pass under
Walworth County Wisconsin.  According to its newspaper "This Week",
dairy farmer Rick Getka laughs at the thought of neutrinos and
said, "Now if I'm walking along and I feel these little
vibrations, I'll know what's going on."   Their reporter wrote
that "Most of us will never even know the neutrinos were here.
Totally harmless, they will head for their big clash with the
thousand-ton iron detector, not even stopping to pick up a
postcard of dairy cows along the way."

*** Science funding report in Japan --- Japan Hadron Project???
</h1>According to the June 13 1997 issue of Science, the Fiscal
Structure Reform Council wants to pare the Japanese budget
deficit from 5.4% to no more than 3% GDP by 2003.  A previously
announced 5-year 17-trillion-yen plan to increase R&amp;D levels 50%
would be stretched out per their recommendations.  The report
"leaves a question mark hanging over.. the Japanese Hadron
Project" which would upgrade the long-baseline K2K project from
12 GeV and low statistics to 50 GeV and high statistics.

*** Hello from Greece</h1>
This last month, a message pointing out that the report on the
Nestor deployment was incomplete was inadvertently broadcast
to the whole list, together with several pages of mail errors.
The settings of the list have been adjusted to make this less
likely from now on.  Meanwhile, a mention of Greek surnamed
physicist Tom Ypsilantis in long-baseline news was found by a
solid state physicist of the same name from Australia, leading
to contact between these two distant cousins, and prompting
Tom to remark that he didn't know long-baseline news had a
personals column.
