*** India-based Neutrino Observatory going ahead
</h1> <p>
The 50 kton atmospheric nu detector has approval from the state
government.  Site work in the West Bodi Hills to start in Feb.

*** 78 Neutrino Whitepapers led the big parade
</h1> <p>
The 2013 Snowmass Neutrino working group is part of the Intensity
Frontier Working Group and itself is divided into 7 study groups.
There was a call for one-page whitepapers on topics of interest
to the community, and 78 were received.  Topics range from
summaries of recent analyses to new ideas for experiments.  See:
<a href="http://www.snowmass2013.org/tiki-index.php?page=Received+Whitepapers">

</a>
and participate in the 6-7 March SLAC meeting.

A memo from the DOE and NSF was sent to clarify the Snowmass
process and other planning efforts for HEP.   It wrote:
"...the DPF-led Snowmass process has been established to identify
compelling science opportunities over an approximately 20 year
time frame."  Some of us don't have 20 years of neutrino studies
left in us, so the studies are most relevant to the younger
members of our community.  If you (think you) are young,
visit

and/or contact Jonathan

or  Roxanne

*** Rows and rows of other studies; Office of Science Facilities
</h1> <p>
Each 10 years, the DOE Office of Science lists large new projects.
This time it is called "Brinkman's Facilities Panel".  Large means
&gt;$100M. Input from the 6 advisory panels is due 22 March.

Fundamental Symmetries and neutrinos are an important part of the
mission of the Division of Nuclear Physics, as emphasized in a
recent report to NSAC.  The Tribble Panel recommended terminating
RHIC, in the event of a no-growth budget.  0nu-beta-beta decay
experiments and Katrin are funded by Nuclear Physics.

An update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics has been
released, but needs to be ratified by the Cern Council in March.
The draft states, "Rapid progress in neutrino oscillation physics,
with significant European involvement, has established a strong
scientific case for a long-baseline neutrino program exploring
CP violation and the mass hierarchy in the neutrino sector. CERN
should develop a neutrino program to pave the way for a
substantial European role in future long-baseline experiments.
Europe should explore the possibility of major participation in
leading neutrino projects in the US and Japan."

*** Alfred K. Mann 1920-2013

</a>
The first idea that I ever heard for a long-baseline neutrino
experiment came from a Fermilab Seminar by Al Mann. His work
appeared in http://prd.aps.org/abstract/PRD/v15/i3/p655_1,
"Neutrino oscillations and the number of neutrino types" in 1977.
At the time of the Long-Baseline Neutrino Workshop in 1992, he
proudly told me that this was the first paper in PRD with a map.
A tireless advocate for a US Underground Lab, he will be missed.

*** George Tzanakos 1948-2013
</h1> <p>
A long-time neutrino researcher, George participated in DONUT,
MINOS, MINERvA and NOvA.  He was a member of the International
Neutrino Commission and organized Neutrino 2010 in Athens Greece.

*** Liquid Argon videos
</h1> <p>
These videos from Terry Tope of the Liquid Argon Purity
Demonstrator show that liquid argon is a very clear colorless cold
liquid.  One video shows a sub-cooled state with no boiling.  The
other is the transition to boiling as the pressure is lowered.

*** NOvA, the next long-baseline neutrino experiment, progress
</h1> <p>

</a>
NOvA is being built in Northern Minnesota block by block, and is
being filled.  Some will be ready for Fermilab beam this summer.

*** Will (former HEP theorist) Ashton Carter be Energy Secretary?
</h1> <p>
I once heard that for any theoretical paper whose title ended in a
question, the answer was no.  This month we see "Could a reported
2007 analysis of Super-Kamiokande data have missed a detectable
supernova signal from Andromeda?" in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3390"> arXiv:1301.3390.
