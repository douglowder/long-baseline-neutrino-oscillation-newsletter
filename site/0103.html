*** K2K Long-Baseline neutrinos by the numbers
</h1>First accelerator long-baseline publication, 150 authors from 20 
institutions, 250 km source to detector, 28 events with 37.8+3.5
-3.8 expected, 10^-3 background, 2.29 10^19 pot.

*** Pontecorvo Prize
</h1>On January 19, 2001, in Dubna, the Scientific Council of Joint
Institute for Nuclear Research awarded the Pontecorvo Prize to 
George Zatsepin and Vladimir Gavrin for outstanding contributions
in elaboration of the Ga method and investigation of the solar 
neutrino flux using this method at Baksan Neutrino Observatory.

*** THESEUS anesTHESEUSized
</h1>Voting 28-23, MINOS is turning off the Soudan 2 and mothballing 
it.   There was also disagreement about both the desirability and 
possibility of turning it on again.  Summer shutdown is expected.

<p> <h1>
*** Karmen Kaput
</h1>An era of short-baseline experiments is over with the end of 
Karmen which has stopped taking data on 8 March.  With no 
oscillation excess, KARMEN still prefers a 3+0 mass scenario
with no sterile neutrinos.  The final results from Karmen2 are 
due this summer with global KARMEN/LSND analysis expected 
autumn.  Karmen is already being dismantled.

<p> <h1>
*** MACRO moribund
</h1>The MACRO experiment is now shut down permanently as of 19 Dec 
2000 15:08 (Italian standard time). Its data taking is now over.

<p> <h1>
*** CHOOZ choice chastised
</h1>The CHOOZ results are central when interpreting the Super-K data.
Their early paper Phys.Lett.B420:397-404,1998, 
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ex/9711002">
hep-ex/9711002 </a>
is 
often quoted, but their second article  "Limits on neutrino 
oscillations from the CHOOZ" contains final and improved results and 
a more detailed analysis Phys.Lett.B466:415-30,1999, 
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ex/9907037"> hep-ex/9907037. </a>

<p> <h1>
*** New NuMass 
</h1>BNL E952 aims to improve the numu mass limit by 20 (170 to 8 keV). 
It utilizes the g-2 storage ring as an extremely uniform one-turn 
spectrometer to compare the parent pi and daughter mu momenta from 
pi decay in flight. The experiment avoids scattering limitations 
by transforming the momentum measurement into a position one; the 
edge of the decay muon radial distribution referenced on an event-
by-event basis to the parent pi depends on m^2 of the nu.

*** Choice of Neutrino Day?
</h1>If you were on the Lead South Dakota City Council, would you have 
picked February 23rd for neutrino day because:
a) 2/23/65 was the day of the 1st atmospheric neutrino event (CWI)
b) 2/23/87 was when neutrinos were recorded from SN1987a
c) 2/23/01 National Underground Science Committee visited Lead?

*** No fires planned at Snowmass this summer 
</h1>A linear guy, a VLHC'er and a muon gal are meeting a funder when a 
fire breaks out.  "Find me a C02 extinguisher!" the linear guy 
demands.  "It is the modern high-tech way to put out fires". "A 
brute-force approach works better!" says the VLHC'er. "Get me a 
shovel to smother the fire using sand."  "What you need to do is 
bring me a hose", chimes the muon gal. "It'll take time to connect 
but water is the best way to extinguish fires."  Confused by the 
options, the funder hands a test tube of baking soda and one of 
vinegar to the linear guy, a spoonful of sand to the VLHC guy and 
an eye-dropper filled with water to the muon gal and asks them to 
all demonstrate their approaches on a small corner of the fire.

*** Is there a connection between neutrino  mass and muon g-2?
</h1>g-2 depends on neutrino mass, but for conventional choices of 
mass, that dependence is phenomenologically uninteresting.  Ma & 
Reidel 
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0102255"> (hep-ph/0102255) </a>
show that to explain the apparent 
discrepancy, threefold neutrino mass degeneracy near 0.2 eV is 
suggested.  Also, interesting mu to e gamma and tau to mu gamma 
branching modes are predicted.  Hisano and Tobe 
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0102315"> (hep-ph/0102315) </a>
discuss g-2 in the supersymmetric see-saw model. &
