<p> </p><h1>
*** Civil Contract approved for Cern to Gran Sasso Beam
</h1>The CERN financial committee approved a contract for the civil
construction of the neutrino beam from CERN to Gran Sasso.  The
beam will be paid for with a substantial contribution of Italian
money, so the 6 bidders for the contract had to show substantial
Italian participation in the consortia that were formed.  The
contracts should be signed in about 3 weeks, and a 32 month
construction schedule is planned.

<p> </p><h1>
*** New K2K data
</h1>With 2 10^19 protons on target, they see 17 observed events in
the fiducial volume, while they expect 29.2 in the absence of
oscillations, a two sigma effect.  For out of fidvol events, the
numbers are 9/12.4, outer detector contained, 8/21.8, and
crossing 10/10.4.  Some more running will be analysed by the
Osaka meeting.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Large Mixing Angle favored for solar neutrinos
</h1>With 1117 days of data (compared to 825 last presented) the
The threshold is lowered to 5 MeV, a unified analysis for the
entire energy region, the Monte Carlo retuned, and re-evaluation
of systematic errors.  Day/Night effect in Super-Kamiokande's
solar nu results has gone down from 1.8 sigma to 1.3 sigma.
D-N/(D+N)/2 = -0.034 +- 0.022 +- 0.013.  The energy spectrum has
flattened out, chi^2 for flat 13.7/17dof.  This rules out the
small mixing angle and vacuum solutions at 95%CL, also the lower
half of the LMA, leaving LOW  and part of the LMA.  Great for
KamLAND!  Sterile nus are ruled out at 95% with global fits.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Fly's Eye winks
</h1>The University of Utah's $14 million cosmic ray observatory at
Dugway Proving Ground was shut down by the Army last month
pending a review of national security concerns.  Dark moonless
running is greater in the winter, so we'll hope its on by then.
An article in the June 7 SLC Tribune tells part of the story.

<p> </p><h1>
*** New Atmospheric neutrino data
</h1>From 70.5 kt-years of Super-K; R=.652 +- .019 +- .051 for subGeV
events and .668 +- .034 +- .07 for Multi-GeV.  Best fit is now
maximal mixing, dmsq 3.2 10^-3 eV^2.  Numu to nusterile is
excluded at 99% CL.  They can get a handle on more exotic
solutions by fitting the data to sin^2 c*L*E^n and they get
n=-1.06+-0.14, which disfavors gravitationally induced neutrino
oscillation explanations, and some other exotic ideas.

<p> </p><h1>
*** How is this data different from all other data
</h1>It wasn't a seder, and John LoSecco was not the youngest at
Neutrino 2000, but he persisted to ask 4 questions about
atmospheric neutrinos, mostly involving consistency with other
data.  Hank Sobel's answers showed the wisdom of Solomon.

<p> </p><h1>
*** SNO works, GNO works, SAGE fails in one attempt
</h1>A scaled Boron-8 distribution matches the SNO charged current
nhit distribution above 60 hits, where the backgrounds are
small.  They conclude that based on the energy, direction and
location, the data in the region of interest appears to be
dominated  by B8 solar neutrinos detected via the charged
current and elastic scattering reactions, with very little
background.   SNO and GNO are the 6th and 7th experiments to
detect solar neutrinos.  GNO saw 65.8 +10.2-9.6+-3.5 SNU,
consistent with Gallex and SAGE.   SAGE was unsuccessful in using
a bottle of vodka to find out the SNO scale factor.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Quo Vadis LSND?
</h1>In a reanalysis of LSND, the average probability of oscillation
shifted a bit lower, to 0.25 +- .06 +- .04%.  Karmen 2 data with
7160 Coulombs rules out the LSND effect as it was in 1993-95, but
not all of the 1993-1998 favored region.  Karmen 2 achieved its
anticipated sensitivity, and will take data till April 2001.
Neutrino summary speaker asked, "Quo Vadis LSND?".  MiniBooNe.
The Karmen timing anomaly went away with new data.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Quo Vadis CERN?
</h1>God wanted first generation long-baseline experiments at 730 km,
so she put Soudan 730 km from FNAL and Gran Sasso 730 km from
CERN.  In agreement with other neutrino factory proponents,
A. DeRujula likes 3000 km for a neutrino factory baseline, but
drew circles that distance from CERN and found Greenland,
Siberia, Chechnya, Iraq, Sudan and Mali.   He concluded that there
was no "peaceful technologically reasonable non-freezing place
3000+-1000 km from Geneva(CH) except the Canary Islands".

<p> </p><h1>
*** Snap and Pop for Neutrinos
</h1>A "name the neutrino" contest suggested 3 years ago by Peter
Rosen only had losing entries, one of which was "Snap, Crackle
and Pop".  The designer of the briefcase for NU2000 used a rather
loud plastic clasp, so at the end of the last speaker's talk at
each session, the hall erupted in a cacophony of snaps.  It's a
nice case, so you may hear it at other meetings.

<p> </p><h1>
*** American Express, VISA or Mastercard
</h1>American Express is marketing their new Blue Card with an ad,
"Was saying NEUTRINOS have mass way before it was cool"
