*** New co-spokesperson for T2K
</h1> <p>
Federico Sánchez, from University of Geneva, was just elected
International Co-Spokesperson of the T2K long-baseline neutrino
experiment.  He joins Atsuko Ichikawa from Kyoto University.

*** End of MINERvA operations in February
</h1> <p>

</a>
The MINERvA experiment finished its physics run at the end of Feb.
after 10 years of recording neutrino interactions in the NuMI beam
using several nuclear targets.  After receiving its full request
for protons on target in both nu and antinu modes in the ~6 GeV
on-axis NuMI beam, MINERvA is turning its attention to extracting
the most out of these data sets.  Some habits die hard though:
MINERvA is running minimal operations of the MINOS Near Detector
to provide NOvA with an on axis spectrum, and of MINERvA to keep
components ready for possible re-use by ProtoDUNE-ND.

*** First Captain result in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05276"> arXiv:1903.05276 </a>
</h1> <p>
The first result from the Mini-CAPTAIN detector is a measurement
of the neutron cross section on Argon in the E range 100-800 MeV.
LAr TPC neutron response is important for E_nu reconstruction.

*** NOvA has an issue with a GPS rollover
</h1> <p>

</a>
The GPS system had a "rollover" in April, a problem reminiscent
of the Y2K issues.  The 10-bit "week number" resets to zero every
1024 weeks.  NOvA knew about the issue but documentation indicated
the hardware connected to the GPS receivers would handle the
issue. Only two days of data were lost as the engineers and op
team quickly rallied to implement hardware and firmware updates.

*** Neutrino Day 13 July 2019
</h1> <p>
While we're dealing with calendars, predicting neutrino day is
harder than knowing Easter's date.  This year its Sat. 13 July.

*** Neutrino mass guarantee
</h1> <p>
Science doesn't come with many guarantees.  I recently looked as
some slides I wrote in 2008 guaranteeing a measurement of nonzero
theta13 in upcoming reactor neutrino experiments.  The Astro2020
White Paper (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03689"> arXiv:1903.03689 </a>)
more reasonably states, "Our
understanding of the clustering of matter in the presence of
massive neutrinos has significantly improved over the past decade,
yielding cosmological constraints that are tighter than any
laboratory experiment, and which will improve significantly over
the next decade, resulting in a guaranteed detection of the
absolute neutrino mass scale."  The future sensitivity on the mass
sum is given to be 14 meV on a number between 57 and ~250.

*** Neutrino spacecraft boosted by NASA
</h1> <p>
NASA has given the neutrino space-craft project a green light &amp;
$500K to work on a Phase-2 project, and estimate a final mission
cost along with a prototype for lab testing; Simulations and
scoping out the science was Phase-1. Marshall SFC engineers will
do the mission studies from launch, orbits, communications, flight
computer, controls and 5 y of operation; they are thinking of a
Super Falcon Heavy with 3 side boosters instead of two for $130 M
launch. A "small explore class" mission has to be under $350 M.

*** Sterile neutrino search wins thesis award
</h1> <p>
Jacob Todd was selected as the recipient of the 2018 URA Thesis
Award, for his thesis on the "Search for Sterile Neutrinos with
MINOS and MINOS+”.  This recognizes his work in producing a very
innovative analysis and documenting it in a high-quality thesis.
It impacted the results that MINOS/MINOS+ recently published
as an Editor’s Suggestion in PRL.  Jacob will get the award and
present his work at the Users Meeting.

*** Wedding Photos at Daya Bay wanted

https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612564/chinas-losing-its-taste-for-nuclear-power-thats-bad-news/ </a>
According to this article, China General Nuclear Power had a
contest, "Most beautiful wedding photos taken at a nuclear power
plant."  But I couldn't find the website to see if neutrinos were
a factor for either the winning or losing entries.
