<h1>Long-Baseline news, April 2008 </h1>


<h1>
*** T2K beam commissioning, First neutrinos
</h1> <p>
The first neutrinos have been produced for the T2K "Tokai to
Kamioka" long-baseline neutrino experiment from the new JPARC
accelerator.  It is using a new beamline to point at the Super-K
detector to search for theta-13.  See the 1st scope (23 April)

from the
muon monitors.  The blue curve is the silicon signal and the red
curve is a scintillation counter installed for commissioning.  The
beam commissioning team is proceeding to establish the optimum
orbit and beam manipulation method.

*** First Neutrinos in MINERvA
</h1> <p>
The first pieces of the fine-grained MINERvA experiment in the
Fermilab NuMI beam have detected their first neutrinos.
The first portion of the detector consists of 24 modules each
3.5 cm thick that sit next to each other like slices of bread.
When the detector is fully assembled in 2010, it will have 108
modules with 30,000 channels.

*** NOvA groundbreaking, First Dirt (Neutrinos already there)
</h1> <p>
Ground was broken on May 1st for the new long-baseline NOvA
experiment (Neutrino Oscillation neutrino Appearance) near Ash
River Minnesota, which will place a new off-axis experiment in the
NuMI beam to search for theta-13.  Actually, the ground was pretty
hard, so the dirt was brought in.  The American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act is providing $40.1 million.  FNAL has committed
an additional $9.9 million in stimulus funding to purchasing key
high-tech components for the project from U.S. companies, allowing
those firms to retain and hire workers.  180 scientists and
engineers from 28 institutions in 7 countries are building the
15,000-ton detector.

*** Ellis in the news, 2 videos

Jon Ellis wrote a piece for Fox News on the NOvA groundbreaking:

*** From Aquila to Aquinas -- TAUP 2009 moved to Rome 1-5 July
</h1> <p>
The International Conference on Topics in Astroparticle and
Underground Physics, previously scheduled in L'Aquila, will be
hosted in the Aula Minor of the "Angelicum -- The Pontifical
University of Saint Thomas Aquinas"

*** Guggenheim award to MIT's Janet Conrad
</h1> <p>
Neutrino Physicist Janet Conrad (MiniBooNE, Double Chooz, NuSOnG)
was awarded a fellowship by the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial
Foundation.  "Each fellow receives a grant adjusted to his or her
needs."

*** April First jokes in France involve fish - (Double Chooz)
</h1> <p>
The Double Chooz Veto tank was floated in water as it was welded.
A 1 Apr message from the spokesman reported a fish in the water
pumped out;  "...This raises an issue to study. As you know, the
veto tank is not anchored. It is just sitting on a flat concrete
area. If a fish become too big, it could push upwards the veto
tank, creating some slope inside. This could have unexpected
consequences for PMTs installation. It is currently under study."
At least 3 Americans fell for it.  In the meantime the veto tubes
were installed, and then the buffer tank.  Soon the PMTs go in.

*** MiniBooNE running extended
</h1> <p>
They wanted more antineutrino data, and the March recommendation
by the Fermilab PAC is to get it. "The Committee recommends
continued running of MiniBooNE for up to an additional 5e20 POT,
provided no significant expense is incurred by Fermilab for this
extra running.  The Collaboration has requested to use the
additional POT solely for antineutrino running.  Given the low-
energy excess in neutrino mode, the Committee recommends the
Collaboration should address the optimal use of the additional POT."

</p><h1>
*** Neutrino Experiments to Share computing resources?
</h1> <p>
A workshop was held at Fermilab to bring together present and future
neutrino experiments to share information on infrastructure and
offline computing.  Several issues were discussed from various
hardware needs to possible sharing a CVS repository for code.

Another workshop is scheduled for March 2010.

*** Refreshment at the Champagne Neutrino Workshop 19-21 Oct.
</h1> <p>
In order to have a high quality logos, the 2009 LowNu Workshop
refined the champagne glass image on its web page (See
<a href="http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/numeetings.html#lownu2009">
http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/numeetings.html#lownu2009)
</a>
Since this replaced an earlier image, users were reminded to
refresh their web pages.  Its ok.  Champagne refreshes.
