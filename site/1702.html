*** Milestone of 700 kW reached for Fermilab neutrino beam to NOvA
</H1> <P>
On 25 Jan. 2017, Fermilab reached the goal of the NOvA-PIP I
program, 700 kW for the proton beam on target.  With some beam to
the switchyard it reached the "700 kW-equivalent" power of 635 kW.
The NOvA long-baseline neutrino experiment is looking forward to
extracting the physics potential that this record power presents.
On 20 February, the horn polarity was changed for antineutrinos.

*** T2K to upgrade its near detector
</H1> <P>
<A href="http://t2k-experiment.org/2017/02/t2k-near-detector-upgrade/"> 
http://t2k-experiment.org/2017/02/t2k-near-detector-upgrade/
</A>
T2K has launched its Near Detector Upgrade project. The upgrade is
targeted at reducing systematic errors in its search for CP
violation. The current conceptual design will be developed into a
technical design, leading to a full proposal, by the end of 2017.
The collaboration aims to install the upgraded near detector
around 2020, to fully benefit from the foreseen increase of the
J-PARC MR beam power.

<H1>
*** DUNE studying its near detector 27-29 March at FNAL
</H1> <P>
The workshop will consider a number of options.

*** Neutrino collaboration elections
</H1> <P>
Ed Blucher from the University of Chicago has been elected
co-spokesperson of DUNE for 2017-2019.  He continues along
with Mark Thomson from Cambridge.  Ornella Palamara has been
elected co-spokesperson of SBND for 2017-2019.  She serves
with Dave Schmitz.  And Peter Shanahan from Fermilab is being
reelected spokesperson of NOvA for 2017-2019.  He serves
with Mark Messier from the University of Indiana.

*** Disparaging the Neutrino masses
</H1> <P>
The low masses of the neutrinos seem appropriate to some of us,
but Ballesteros et al. mention that the three masses for
nu1, nu2 and nu3 are "disparagingly smaller than any physics
scale in the SM."  They go on to unify inflation with the
axion, dark matter, Baryogenesis and the seesaw mechanism in
PRL118, 071802 (2017),

*** Mobile Neutrino Laboratory
</H1> <P>
Before long-baseline neutrino beams were a reality, Bjorken
proposed putting ionization detectors on trucks and driving
them around Michigan to study the Fermilab neutrino beam.
Now a mobile neutrino detector built by Virginia Tech is a
reality, but to measure reactor antineutrinos.  MiniCHANDLER
uses solid scintillator which will allow it measure about
100 interactions per day.

*** SETI with neutrinos, NU-SETI
</H1> <P>
The search for extra-terrestrial intelligence with nus is the
subject of a proposal by Fischbach & Gruenwald.

*** Neutrino mass matters to the universe
</H1> <P>
My best guess is that the sum of the nu masses, m-nu1+m-nu2+m-nu3,
is close to the sum of the square root of two measured delta-m^2,
or 60 meV.  The 9-year WMAP analysis made this assumption, but
the pre-Planck ACT/SPT analyses did not.  Calabrese et al. show
this affects the best fit cosmological parameters by 0.25-2 sigma
in their 2017 update.

collaborators, watch the video "We are DUNE" produced at FNAL.
