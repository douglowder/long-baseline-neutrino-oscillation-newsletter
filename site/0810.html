*** International Design Study - Neutrino Factory Planning March
</h1> <p>
The next IDS-NF meeting will be at CERN 23-24 Mar 09.  It will
take place alongside the EUROnu meeting 23-26 Mar.  Parallel
sessions for EUROnu will be 23-24 Mar; plenary 25-26.  The
IDS-NF meeting and the parallel session of the Neutrino Factory
work package of EUROnu will take place together.  The web site is

(bad certificate.  They'll
fix it, but if you trust me, adding an exception is OK.)

*** Theory White Paper on DUSEL physics seeks signatures
</h1> <p>
A theory workshop last spring has led to a Theory White Paper
supporting the wide range of physics, including neutrino physics,
which can be carried out at a new large underground detector.  It
is now available and they are seeking additional signatures.
"The theory community is excited by the prospect of DUSEL, since
this would create a U.S. center for studies of proton decay,
neutrino oscillations and astrophysics, dark matter, and the very
nature of the neutrino and the neutron and other possible forefront
experiments probing the properties of nature".  To read and/or
support it, see

*** Fermilab Beam to DUSEL
</h1> <p>
A new working group at Fermilab under Jeff Appel strives to
understand the optimum parameters, costs and possible schedule for
a neutrino beam from Fermilab to DUSEL.  They are discussing
beam optics, extraction, new civil, targeting, near detector hall,
instrumentation, etc.  The new plan is that NuMI-Minnesota will be
upgraded to 700 Kw, but 2MW will be for NuMI-South Dakota.  See

*** It costs extra to be the flagship
</h1> <p>
It will not be appropriate to take the level of risk associated with
the NuMI project for FNAL-DUSEL, if this is to be the flagship of the
US HEP program, as suggested by the P5 report.   But the beam design
can take advantage of "lessons learned" from the NuMI experience,
which include 1) tritium production and mitigation; 2) decay pipe
window corrosion and 3) lack of early spare target/horns.

*** NSF S4 solicitation for DUSEL out
</h1> <p>
The NSF plans to make available $5M per year for 3 years.  The
funds awarded for the proposals selected in S4 will allow the
proposing team to complete the design phase(s) through Preliminary
Design or beyond.  The full proposal deadline is 9 Jan 09.

*** Dewatering Homestake for DUSEL
</h1> <p>
Homestake is pumping out water more slowly than originally hoped.
This is partly due to dissolved iron in the water, which must be
treated before it is released.  Unfortunately, this water cannot
be used to make a magnetized water Cerenkov detector.  The current
schedule is to reach the 4850 level by July 09.

*** SNO elastic scattering measurement with He counters seems low
</h1> <p>
The SNO experiment has measured the solar neutral current rate
three ways now, and they all agree.  They had a heavy water phase,
a salt phase, and a helium counter phase.  CC rates agree too.
They also measure the elastic scattering cross section (which is a
mixture of NC and CC).  The recent ES measurement seems low,
compared to the salt phase or the more precise Super-K result
(PRD73,112001,2006] They measure 1.77 +.24-.21(stat)+.09-.10(sys)
10^-6/cm^-s, based on 171 events, with 2.4 expected.  A
statistical fluctuation is a likely explanation.

</p><h1>
*** Terrestrial Neutrino Units
</h1> <p>
Solar Neutrino Physicists wanted to work in convenient units, so
they invented the Solar Neutrino Unit or SNU.  1 SNU = 10^(-36)
captures per target atom per second.   Even though the earth is
closer to most neutrino detectors than the sun, it is only slowly
decaying and not burning (thank goodness), so the convenient unit
is smaller.  The Terrestrial Neutrino Unit or TNU = 1 event per
10^32 protons per year.  KamLAND measured 57 TNU (+33-31) and
geology models and heat energy balance give predictions.

*** Bill the neutrino physicist AND plumber
</h1> <p>
Accelerator Physicist
<a href="http://foster08.com/"> Bill Foster </a>
won reelection to a US Congress
seat from Illinois.  There are 3 times as many Bills as Joes on
this email list.  The US also tried to elect a President, but
Palin is from Alaska and Obama was born in Hawaii, which aren't
real states to many of us over 50.  McCain was born in Panama, and
Biden's first name is Joe, so none of them were really qualified.

*** CERN workshop on Neutrino Relics/Mass 8 Dec 08
</h1> <p>
The goals are to identify promising directions for detector/beams
technology development, stimulate theoretical work, identify the
technologies which can reach the next orders of magnitude over
KATRIN sensitivity and possibly discover neutrino relics, ...

*** MiniBooNE Anti-neutrinos
</h1> <p>
MiniBooNE has results for muon nu and anti-nu disappearance. They
observe no disappearance, reducing some of the region allowed by
3+2 models. The anti-neutrino results are in a new region of phase
space.  Maybe anti-nu appearance results in Dec 08.
