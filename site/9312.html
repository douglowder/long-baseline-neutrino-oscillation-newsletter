<p>
</p><h1>Ken Stanfield's letter</h1>
P822 received a letter from Ken Stanfield, (Fermilab Deputy
Director) telling us results from the PAC consideration of our
proposal in November.   It positive about a long baseline
experiment at Fermilab's Main Injector, but not about the
present P-822 proposal.  In private discussions with PAC members
and Fermilab people, a wide range of concerns were raised.  The
most common one was the lack of a proposal for a new more
massive detector at the Soudan site.   The PAC reiterated two
characteristics of a long baseline proposal which it felt
``(P822) does not yet satisfy", which were
# A sensitivity in the exclusion plot of 10^-2 eV^2 in delta
mass squared and 10^-2 in mixing angle.
# The capability of a convincing positive signal, including
determination of backgrounds and systematics.

<h1>BNL proposal</h1>
Ted Kycia's idea for a calorimeter in Connecticut has been
submitted to Brookhaven.  He is proposing 6 kton of optical
spark chambers with video camera readout at 100km from
BNL, which would give 583 events at the far detector in 3000
hours.

<h1>Other ideas at Fermilab</h1>
A new idea being considered at Fermilab is to run the Main
Injector at 30 GeV and do a disappearance experiment at 20km or
so, very much like BNL E-889.  Argonne is at the right distance
for that.

<h1>Main Injector review, key decision 3.</h1>
A report on a review of the Main Injector project concludes that
$75M could be spent responsibly on the Main Injector in FY95.
The Congressional Budget Request plan passed last year would
allocate $43M and finish the project in January of 1999.  The
total estimated costs is $229.6M or $259.1M total cost including
R&amp;D, pre-operations and other.  The Illinois delegation sent a
letter to Hazel O'Leary calling for at least $50M in FY95.
She answered,"...The Department Considered the recommendations of
the Witherell subpanel of the HEPAP in formulating our request
to OMB."
<p>
She also has approved Key Decision 3, which allows Fermilab to
really spend money, but not sent it along because it is somehow
tied to a fusion project she doesn't like.  But she sent along
notice to spend money as if Fermilab had received KD3.
The review committee was very positive about most everything
being done by Fermilab on the Main Injector.  One concern was a
lack of presentations on slow extraction.

</p><h1>822 meeting in January or February</h1>
We had earlier scheduled an 822 meeting in mid January.  With
the active recruiting for new collaborators taking place, a few
people have said they might attend a collaboration meeting, so a
date will probably be set after the first of the year either in
late January or early to mid February.

<h1>803 studying proton west and perhaps neutrino area</h1>
At its first meeting after becoming E-803, attention was focused
on the physics and feasability of various Main Ring options,
including proton west but also the neutrino area.  A criterion
was suggested and adopted that the goal be to have a better
limit than CHORUS at 10 eV squared.

<h1>HEPAP review?</h1>
When and How will there be a comparison of the Fermilab and
Brookhaven Long Baseline Neutrino Oscillation Programs?  At the
November Fermilab PAC meeting, John O'Fallon said that such a
comparison would be needed.  There are decisions
which need to be made with regards to the short term and long
term future of US HEP, such as the Drell panel will discuss.
We don't yet know how or when this will be discussed, but one
speculation is that at the January HEPAP meeting at Brookhaven,
where their long baseline program will be featured, HEPAP will
point out that a FNAL/BNL comparison is needed and set something
up within 6 months.  The next HEPAP meeting is a budget meeting
in Washington DC in March.

<h1>P822 pattern recognition program.</h1>
At Rutherford, the Soudan Offline Analysis Program (SOAP) has
been used for the first time to separate Neutral Current and
Charged Current events generated by the P822 Monte Carlo.  This
will allow high statistics analysis of P822 events so that many
of the concerns about systematic error on the NC/CC ratio test
can be analytically answered.
