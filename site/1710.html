*** How many neutrinos are created when 2 neutron stars collide?
</h1> <p>
I don't know.  But people thought about it in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05922"> arXiv:1710.05922 </a>
and looked for them in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.05839"> arXiv:1710.05839 </a>
and

in DUNE?" at

by 26 Nov.
Also, a discussion of collective neutrino oscillations and
nucleosynthesis by Balantekin can be found in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04108"> arXiv:1710.04108 </a>.

*** How long is the history of the universe?
</h1> <p>
Many astronomers hosted eclipse parties on 21 Aug.  They were also
working on observations of the 17 Aug. neutron star collision.  At
the event I attended in southern Illinois there was a lecture on
the history of the universe, but the speaker ran out of time.

*** LBNC meets at Sanford Lab
</h1> <p>
The LBNC (not to be confused with LBNE, LBNO, LBNF or LBNEIEIO*)
is the Long-Baseline Neutrino Committee.  They are a panel of
leading neutrino scientists who regularly review DUNE and LBNF
for Fermilab management.  [* Old McDonald's (aka Steve Magill)
entry in the 2015 naming contest which was won by DUNE.  I've
never called this newsletter LBNN, but I guess I could.]

*** First results from CUORE on 0nu-beta-beta from Te
</h1> <p>
CUORE started running in March with 988 TeO_2 crystals (34%
130Te abundance) and has 86.3 kg-yr (natural Te).  The best fit
for a signal in the region of interest(2165-2575 keV) is negative.
The Bayesian lifetime limit is &gt;1.3e25y, for an m_(beta-beta) &lt;
100-400 meV.  Running at 10 mK with the coldest cubic meter in the
known universe
(<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1560"> arXiv:1410.1560 </a>),
they commissioned the cryostat
2014-Mar 2016, installed through 26 Aug 2016, saw their 1st pulse
27 Jan 17, and a "science run" started 24 April.

*** CUPID
</h1> <p>
CUORE will run 5 more years.  The next generation of experiment
is CUPID (CUORE Upgrade with Particle IDentification).  It would
be difficult and expensive to reduce backgrounds further with
better radiopurity.  Instead, the idea is to instrument each
crystal with a photodetector and use particle identification to
separate background alphas from signal betas.

</p><h1>
*** LBNF beam optimization
</h1> <p>
A recurring tradeoff in neutrino experiments is how much effort
to put into beam design versus how much effort to put into
detector design.  An October review studied an optimized design
for the LBNF neutrino beam.  The Experiment Facility Interface
Group (EFIG) has concluded that the optimized beamline offered
compelling improvements to the physics reach and should be
implemented.  The optimized target and horn design leads to a
36% improvement in the flux within the important 1-4 GeV
neutrino energy range.  The optimized design has implications
for other systems, such as conventional facilities and remote
handling.  Additional costs and schedule delays have been
estimated and are not large.

</p><h1>
*** The other hierarchy
</h1> <p>
Our collider friends (sometimes) worry about their own hierarchy
problem, i.e. why the Higgs mass isn't near the Planck mass.  One
solution is supersymmetry, which explains this one number but
doubles the number of parameters.  In the "Neutrino Option",
by I. Brivio in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.01007"> arXiv:1710.01007 </a>,
the Higgs mass is explained
as a radiative correction, while there is a "new challenge of
generating PeV Majorana masses while suppressing the tree-level
scalar potential in the UV".

*** MICE considers move to Protvino
</h1> <p>
Since mid-September, the Muon Ionization Colling Experiment (MICE)
at Rutherford has been taking high quality data with its liquid
Hydrogen absorber.  It had previously tested ionization cooling
with a Lithium hydride absorber.  They have developed a novel
emittance analysis technique to compensate for the loss of a
superconducting coil in the downstream spectrometer solenoid.
With at most a few more months of data to be taken at RAL, they
are considering a more ambitious follow-up experiment at Protvino.

*** Neutrino comics
</h1> <p>
Oxford Masters' student Unnati Akhouri has physics comics at
<a href="https://fatalphysics.wordpress.com/phymics-2/adventures-of-super-electron/">
https://fatalphysics.wordpress.com/phymics-2/adventures-of-super-electron/
</a>
The neutrino is featured in "The Tale of the Neutrinos" in
addition to "The Weak Force Awakens" about Supernova 1987a.
