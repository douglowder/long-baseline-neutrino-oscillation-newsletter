*** Precise new results from KamLAND
</h1>
At Nu04, KamLAND showed analysis from 545 days of data
(previously it was 145).  They also increased the fiducial volume
33%, cutting now at 5.5m.  They observe 258 events.  365+-24 was
expected without oscillations, plus 7.5+-1 background.  Due to
reactor issues in Japan, reactor flux was down in 2003 almost a
factor of two.  The energy spectrum now adds substantial
information to the fit.  The best fit to oscillations is delta
m^2 8.3 e-5 and sin^2 2theta 0.83.  A fit to a rescaled reactor
spectrum is excluded at 99.89%CL.  The best fit excludes LMA2,
pins delta m^2 &amp; agrees well with global fits.

*** NOvA
</h1>
In evaluating the new Fermilab long-baseline NOvA proposal, the
PAC said that to establish a compelling case there were 4
criteria:   Uniqueness, Competitiveness with T2K, Competitiveness
with reactor experiments and capability for evolution.  They
BOLDLY declared that NOvA can meet these criteria if it is built
in a timely manner. Steps to achieve stage 1 approval were: 1)
finalize detector design, 2) complete near term R&amp;D, 3) update
proposal with the full physics case.  They endorsed the R&amp;D plan.

*** Snowmass Neutrino
</h1>
The US Neutrino Community held a lively meeting in Snowmass to
prepare a report on the future program of neutrino program in the
US.  Six working groups presented reports which included a number
of ideas to aggressively exploit the recent progress in the
neutrino sector.   The details of the recommendations' format and
content were vigorously debated, but the range of exciting
opportunities in the neutrino sector in the next few years was
universally agreed to.   Presentations can be found at

Much attention focused on a program for theta_13 with  expts
at reactors &amp; accelerators, and a double beta decay program.

*** APS study nitty gritty dirt
</h1>
A writing committee chaired by Hamish Robertson is staying in
Snowmass 7/1-4 to prepare a DRAFT 30 page overarching document
for the APS neutrino study.  The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band will be
performing in Snowmass 7/2-4. Coincidence?  Drafts will be linked

*** Proton Intensity for Fermilab Booster up up up
</h1>
In June 2004, the benefit of several improvements in the Fermilab
Proton Source came to impressive fruition. A record of 9.73E18
POT (MiniBooNE) was achieved, and all four weeks were at least
10% higher than any previous week.  During normal operation there
were multiple periods of several hours each in which the
MiniBooNE horn had to run at its limit of 5 Hz for the first
time.  The horn rate and the protons per pulse are about 80% of
goals. All of these improvements are firmly based on controlling
the residual radiation in the Booster.  Further improvements in
June are expected to reach the MiniBooNE goal 9E16 POT/hour.

*** EPP2010
</h1>
The National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy have
asked the Board on Physics and Astronomy (BPA) of the National
Research Council to convene a committee that will undertake a
study of the field of elementary-particle physics.  In
particular, the committee will be charged to:
1.  Identify, articulate, and prioritize the scientific questions
and opportunitites that define elementary-particle physics.
2.  Recommend a 15-year implementation plan with realistic,
ordered priorities to realize these opportunities.  The BPA seeks
to gather input on the makeup of the committee that will carry
out the study.  Send comments/suggestions to  by
7/15.

*** Recognizing name recognition
</h1>
Last month John Bahcall received the Golden Plate award of the
Academy of Achievement.  Other honorees (mostly not scientists)
included the King of Jordan, Julie Andrews, the head of Mexico's
Beer brewing empire, NY mayor Mike Bloomberg, the prime minister
of Turkey, John Updike, Sally Ride, the founder of google,
Norman Mailer, the head of the Blackberry firm, and Alexei
Abrikosov.  It is important for the progress of our field that we
talk about our work to people who influence policy decisions that
ultimately determine whether we get to do the work or not.

*** Neutrino-fest during 2005, the year of physics.
</h1>
Ideas are being developed for holding a Neutrino-Fest at the
April APS meeting in Tampa.  This will include both neutrino
sessions for physicists but there are also tentative ideas for
outreach.  Interested volunteers contact

*** Fermilab to Beijing
</h1>
Discussions are taking place about a possible long-baseline
neutrino oscillation experiment from Fermilab to Beijing, a
distance of 9400 km.  The first oscillation minimum would be 17
GeV with a second minimum at 5 GeV.  The beam would aim down at
48 degrees.  A megaton detector is being considered.

*** DUSEL solicitation workshop August 11-14 at Berkeley
</h1>
UC is organizing a site independent workshop on the
Science and Engineering opportunities of a Deep Underground Lab
(or set of laboratories).
