*** First NuMI/MINOS pulses 
</h1>
Commissioning of the NuMI primary proton beam has begun.  Protons
from the Main Injector were kicked into the NuMI extraction 
channel and transported through the accelerator enclosure, down 
the NuMI stub and carrier tunnel, through the pretarget area, the 
two focussing horns, and finally down the 675 m long decay region 
to the center of the hadron absorber.  The NuMI commissioning team 
did this using only 10 carefully planned Main Injector pulses!

*** Not TSUNAMI
</h1>
Back when MINOS was known as P875, a naming contest was held.
It was decided not to name it the "Tower-Soudan Underground 
Neutrinos At the Main Injector".

<p> <h1>
*** TSUNAMI in Illinois?
</h1>
During the last Fermilab shutdown, motion sensors were installed 
on all of the magnets, making the Tevatron a sensitive 
seismograph.  Large spikes seen at the time of the Boxing Day 
earthquake are being studied.

*** T2K receives final approval
</h1>
The Japanese Government has given final approval to the new 
long-baseline neutrino beam from the new JPARC accelerator in 
Tokai to the Super-Kamiokande site.  (290 km) This had been approved, then 
rejected, then reapproved last year.   It is now 
categorized as a Class A project with a 2009 start.  An 
international collaboration is planning near detectors, and 
Super-K will be re-outfitted with twice as many phototubes 
(i.e. back to the pre-accident phototube coverage).

<p> <h1>
*** MiniBooNE run extended through 2006
</h1>
One key decision of the Fermilab November PAC meeting was 
to extend MiniBooNE running in FY2006.  This was approved. 
Further running (which might include antinuetrinos) will 
require a proposal, for which the results of the first phase 
will be a important input.  MiniBooNE projects obtaining its
first results on nu_mu -> nu_e oscillations in fall of 2005.

*** NIWA wins Nishina prize
</h1>
Professor Kimio Niwa from Nagoya University was awarded the 
2004 Nishina memorial prize.  The prize was awarded for his
detection of the Tau neutrino in the Fermilab emulsion DONUT 
experiment.  The Nishina-prize is one of the important prizes 
of Physics in Japan.

*** DUSEL solicitation
</h1>
The deadline for Solicitation 2 for the Deep Underground Science 
and Engineering Laboratory Site and Conceptual Designs has been 
postponed from  10-Jan-05 to 28-Feb-05. NSF also wants to note 
that anyone who has submitted a proposal in advance of the old 
deadline can withdraw that proposal, modify it, and resubmit it 
before the new deadline if they wish.

*** NNN Workshop in Aussois 7-9 April
</h1>
The NNN05 workshop which will be held in France at Aussois near
the underground national lab (LSM) from 7-9-APR-05.  NNN 
stands for Next Nucleon Decay and Neutrino detector.

Brazil will be 23-25 Feb-05.

*** Who Saw See-Saws When (3)
</h1>
After two previous long-baseline newsletters (
<a href="0308.html"> Aug03 </a>

& 
<a href="0408.html"> Aug04 </a>

)
reviewed the 1979 conference proceedings in which the see-saw 
mechanism was brought forward 25 years ago, several readers 
pointed out that the see-saw formula appeared in a somewhat 
different context in the earlier "mass by mixing" papers:  
1)  "VECTOR - LIKE WEAK CURRENTS AND NEW ELEMENTARY FERMIONS", 
H. Fritzsch, Murray Gell-Mann, P. Minkowski, CALT-68-517,

</a>

2) "VECTOR - LIKE WEAK CURRENTS, MASSIVE 
NEUTRINOS, AND NEUTRINO BEAM OSCILLATIONS", H. Fritzsch, P. 
Minkowski, CALT-68-525, 
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/03702693">
