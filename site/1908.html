*** J-PARC neutrino program strategy Recommendation
</h1> <p>
It makes sense that while Hyper-K will be under construction, T2K
should operate, but likely budget allocations are not sufficient.
T2K had requested a beam extension to 20E21 POT.  A panel formed
to discuss a J-PARC neutrino program strategy has recommended that
if Hyper-K is approved, beam operation of 10E21 POT take place
in parallel with beam and near detector upgrades for T2K.

*** ProtoDUNE-DP LAr filling complete at CERN neutrino platform
</h1> <p>
In the dual-phase detector, the electrons drift upward to deposit
charge on a plane of anodes.   Amplification electronics are
above the liquid argon in a gaseous argon environment. The 2nd or
3rd DUNE 10-kt module will likely use this technology.  See the
filling at:

*** DUNE TDR
</h1> <p>
A draft multiple-volume technical design report describing the
detectors, physics, beam, etc. for the Deep Underground Neutrino
Experiment is being reviewed by the Long-Baseline Neutrino
Committee (LBNC), which reports to Fermilab management.  The plan
is to submit the document near the end of calendar 2019.

*** New results from NOvA using neutral currents in antinus
</h1> <p>
A new search for evidence of sterile neutrinos in NOvA using
NC Disappearance with antineutrinos was presented by Michael
Wallbank at DPF 2019.  A predicted NC rate of 122 with 78%
purity was compared to an observed rate of 121 +- 11 +- 18.
It was consistent with oscillations in the 3-flavor framework.

*** NNN 2019 in Colombia
</h1> <p>
The International Workshop on Next Generation Nucleon Decay and
Neutrino Detectors (NNN2019) for the first time will be in Latin
America at the University of Medellin, Colombia, on  7-9 Nov.
There will be parallel sessions on neutrino detectors and also
Systematics and Analysis Techniques.

*** Neutrinos must flow

It will form the largest and furthest detector in the FNAL short-
baseline program to study the current short-baseline anomalies,
together with MicroBooNE &amp; the Short-Baseline Neutrino Detector.

*** Neutrinos to the Rescue
</h1> <p>
We get tips (and appreciate them).  For example we were told about
the following web site along with a note, "Neutrinos have made
their way into Snake Oil territory!"  But by the time this
newsletter came out this month, the web page had been taken down.
Maybe electric vehicles can't run on neutrino energy.

But with Google's help, I found the silly idea at

*** Neutrino inspired music

Fermilab artist-in-residence Adam Nadel used a MicroBooNE event
(3493.41075) for a musical score for 2 pianos and a violoncello

*** RANT Hyphen almost always needed in long- and short-baseline
</h1> <p>
If we do an experiment with a long baseline, long is an adjective
and baseline is a noun.  There is no ambiguity and no hyphen is
needed.  If I do a long-baseline neutrino experiment or facility,
or work on a short-baseline program, it is the baseline that is
long or short and not the neutrino, the experiment, the facility
or the program.  The hyphen removes ambiguity.  Long-baseline
experiments will likely take a long time, &amp; be long long-baseline
experiments.  And if Ken Long from Imperial College ever builds a
Nu factory, that will be Long's long long-baseline experiment.
