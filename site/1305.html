*** New Minerva results on quasi-elastic scattering
</H1> <P>
Minerva has measured neutrino and antineutrino quasi-elastic
scattering on a Hydrocarbon target.  Good agreement is obtained
with a model where m_A (the axial mass) is 0.99 GeV/c^2, but
modifications are made to account for the cross section for the
exchange of transversely polarized photons in electron-nucleus
scattering.  m_A doesn't need to be increased.  They also observe 
effects consistent with multiple protons in the final state.

*** What LBNE is and isn't
</H1> <P>
The reconfiguration process left several different documents which
covered the physics reach of the Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment
describing different programs.  LBNE is clarifying that LBNE is a 
plan for a 34 kiloton liquid Argon detector underground at SURF 
with a fully capable near detector.  The 1st phase which has CD1, 
for a 10 kiloton detector without a near detector is called 
LBNE10.  It is a high priority goal to be placed underground.

*** Liquid Argonne?
</H1> <P>
Usually I don't repeat a news item or correct a mistake, as I did
just above, but last month's "Liquid Argonne" made me nervous.

<H1>
*** Neutrinos and the Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans
</H1> <P>
There is an apparent modest increase of susceptibility to 
ivermectin in individual P-glycoprotein loss-of-function strains.  
Why care?  This paper references the MINOS neutrino oscillation 
measurement paper (Adamson et al.) in an unknown typo.  It helped 
the paper reach 500 citations, an INSPIRE "renowned paper".

*** Ice cube sees a new source of astrophysical neutrinos
</H1> <P>
By examining events with large energy loss, Ice Cube has found
astrophysical neutrinos at higher energies than are expected
from atmospheric neutrinos.  They reported 2 events in
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.5356"> arXiv:1304.5356.  </A>
A contained vertex search
has 28 events over an atmospheric neutrino background of 10.6.

They have also been able to measure atmospheric neutrino 
oscillation parameters:

*** Symmetry challenge: Neutrino oscillation analogy

Science writers think that if we start with a beam of muon nus at 
Fermilab and measure tau or e nus 100s of miles away, that someplace 
in between they changed.  This is wrong, but they keep trying.

<H1>
*** Snowmass neutrino update
</H1> <P>
There is a call for Snowmass white papers, besides the nu 1pagers:
<A href="https://www-public.slac.stanford.edu/snowmass2013/submissionform.aspx"> 
https://www-public.slac.stanford.edu/snowmass2013/submissionform.aspx
</A>
The purpose of 1 pagers was to define the SLAC meeting program.
The conveners encourage neutrino white paper authors to submit 
their papers via this mechanism, for inclusion in the overall 
Snowmass proceedings (it will not happen automatically).  There is 
no page limit on these, so you may extend the length.  You must 
first submit the paper to the arXiv, and then log the contribution 
at the above link.  Please notify the nu conveners, especially if 
there are significant changes relevant to the discussions.  The
proceedings deadline is 30 Sep 2013.  Earlier to be useful in the 
discussions and summary writeup.  Nu related Snowmass link:

*** International Symposium on Underground Physics for Snowmass
</H1> <P>
A pre-Snowmass meeting considered the advantages of placing LBNE
at SURF underground (most likely at 4850 level).  These include
the ability to search for nucleon decay, atmospheric neutrino
oscillations and the possible detection of supernova neutrinos 
(as opposed to antineutrinos).  All agreed that it should be
underground.  A document will follow.

*** Glashow and precision
</H1> <P>
I've heard several people mention Sheldon Glashow's view of the 
High Energy Physics field in 2013 (arXiv:1305.5482) so I will do 
so.  In his section on neutrinos, he mentions three potentially 
transformative experiments, and one astrophysical challenge, that 
could be part of the U.S. program.  Two relate to the mass 
hierarchy, and the detection of CP violation.  He would also like 
to see the reactor neutrino disappearance measurements of theta-13 
confirmed by accelerator experiments using electron neutrino 
appearance.  But he concludes that we must avoid the pursuit of 
accuracy for its own sake.

<H1>
*** Fractional neutrinos
</H1> <P>
Steven Weinberg suggests how to get 4/7 or 43/57 of a neutrino
in the contribution to N-eff.  Goldstone bosons.
