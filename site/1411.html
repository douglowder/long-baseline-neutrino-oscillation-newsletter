*** Support the new long-baseline program
</H1> <P>
<A href="https://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=9090">  
https://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=9090  </A>Please
support the new collaboration by signing the LOI.  All community
members including graduate students and technicians are invited to
sign, (of course follow the rules of your own institution.  This
might require approval of a supervisor).  This is not the document
that will be sent to the PAC, which will also be called an LOI but
state the physics case in a fuller way.

<H1>
*** Proto-collaboration meeting for ELBNF (21)-22-24 January 2015
</H1> <P>
A temporary chair for a new institutional board for an Experiment
at the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility will be chosen soon to
help set up the new collaboration called for in the P5 Report.
The iIEB (
<A href="https://web.fnal.gov/project/iiEB/Pages/iiEB-home.aspx">  
https://web.fnal.gov/project/iiEB/Pages/iiEB-home.aspx) </A>
has agreed to a proto-collaboration meeting on 22-24 Jan, at a
location to be determined (best guess is Fermilab).  21 Jan
will be a day when working groups can meet as well.

<H1>
*** Workshop on the Intermediate Neutrino Program at BNL 4-6 Feb.
</H1> <P>
This workshop will address various proposals and projects being
discussed or under way. The aim of the workshop is to develop the
scientific case and the collaborations. The output of the workshop
will help the community to define the path forward on the "small"
experiments.

Register by 9 Jan.

*** Nishina Prize for neutrino work
</H1> <P>
T. Koboyashi (T2K spokesperson) and T. Nakaya (Hyper-K leader
and T2K member) have received the Nishina Memorial Prize in Japan
for "Discovery of electron neutrino appearance from muon neutrino
beam." Since 1955, the Nishina Memorial Prize has been awarded
annually by the Nishina Memorial Foundation.  The Foundation was
established to commemorate Yoshio Nishina, who was the founding
father of modern physics research in Japan and a mentor of the 1st
2 Japanese Nobel Laureates, Hideki Yukawa and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga.

*** Panofsky Prize for neutrino work
</H1> <P>
Stan Wojcicki has won the 2015 Panofsky Prize. "For his leadership
and innovative contributions to experiments probing the flavor
structure of quarks and leptons, in particular for his seminal role
in the success of the MINOS neutrino oscillation experiment."

*** First CHIPS prototype deployed 
</H1> <P>
The CHIPS collaboration deployed its first prototype detector 60 m
underwater in a mine pit in northern Minnesota on 1 Aug.  The goal 
of CHIPS is to develop massive, low-cost neutrino detectors, using 
lake water as the structural support, and purified lake water as 
the target volume. The prototype "CHIPS M" took data, detecting 
cosmic rays and monitoring the attenuation length.  The Experience 
will be used to inform the design of larger detectors.

*** FNAL opens Remote Operations Center for Intensity Experiments
</H1> <P>
Neutrino Experiments at Fermilab have moved their shifts to a new
control room called the ROC-West.  It is situated on the first 
floor of Wilson Hall, and is visible to visitors and theorists.

It depends on your perspective, but none of them seem weird to me.
