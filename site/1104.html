<h2>Focusing on horns </h2>

<h1>
*** Horn designer Simon Van der Meer, 1925-2011
</h1> <p>
At the 1963 Sienna Conference Simon van der Meer wrote, "In view
of enhancing the fluxes of high energy neutrinos required for
experiments, it is useful to focus towards the neutrino detector
the pi's and Ks produced by protons interacting in the target.
The statistically determined change in direction of the neutrino
with respect to its parent pion or kaon will set a limit to the
precision of focusing that is useful."  A plasma device built
by Lederman for BNL didn't work.  Horns have gone on to enhance
neutrino fluxes at labs around the world.

</p><h1>
*** Horns at ANL
</h1> <p>
A horn was built for the nu experiment at ANL led by Telegdi, and
then used for the bubble chamber.  A 2nd "reflector" was built to
increase the flux 30% based on calculations by then-postdoc Phil
Schreiner.  A power supply was ordered from Europe and arrived in
the US but was destroyed when a truck took it under a bridge
without enough clearance.  Walter Prague then made a power supply
on his own.  Both horns operated for the rest of chamber's life.

</p><h1>
*** Horns at Fermilab
</h1> <p>
A horn focuses as many pions as possible in the forward direction,
to maximize the neutrino flux.  The first MINOS horn simulations
used NUADA, a program that has a "perfect focus" option.  This put
all pions parallel at the center of the beam.  This is unachievable,
but by comparing the neutrino flux to perfect focus, there was a
meaningful figure of merit for any horn design.  Jim Hylen has
kept the NuMI/MINOS horns working, and he recalls, "The best horn
story I remember is Frank Nezrick showed me an inner conductor
they bent into an S shape (amazingly without breaking it) when the
cooling failed on a horn test stand. Second best is the one I heard
about them putting a bucket under the end of the horn at WANF, and
periodically emptying it, after the water spray jet eroded through
the inner conductor -- but the horn continued to run fine!"

</p><h1>
*** Horns in Europe
</h1> <p>
In the 80's &amp; 90's, Stephen Rangod worked with Jean-Marie Maugain
on R&amp;D at CERN allowed for replacing coaxial cables with strip-
line bus bars for powering horns.  This allowed avoiding the high
tension on the fragile horns, and was a big step toward more
reliable operation.  In the 90s and into the 2000s, a fruitful
collaboration was established between several labs interested in
horn design, KEK, Fermilab and CERN, and later CNRS in France and
others. This allowed injecting the latest developments into the
horn design for CNGS. For example, the 7 m long inner conductor
was built as one single piece, thanks to welding by electron
bombardment.  Using glass as an insulator and graphite as seals
have also allowed reducing the cost of horn construction. A semi-
rigid strip-line connection developed by CNRS Orsay and a water
inlet coaxially inside the water outlet make the horn exchange
somewhat easier, although this still remains a major operation.

</p><h1>
*** South Pole Telescope search for neutrino mass
</h1> <p>
The Cosmic microwave background (CMB) was discovered accidentally
in 1964 by Penzias &amp; Wilson using a well-calibrated horn antenna.
One device currently studying the CMB is the South Pole Telescope,
a 10 m diameter wide-field telescope with a mm-wave bolometer
camera.  The data will be used to characterize the primordial
matter power spectrum.  A second-generation camera will measure
the polarization of the CMB.  From the analysis of the resulting
polarization maps, the project will determine the angular power
spectrum of the CMB B-mode polarization (curl component) induced
by the lensing of the intrinsic E-mode polarization (curl-free
component) by large-scale structures. The lensing B-mode spectrum
provides sensitivity to the nu masses through their impact on the
growth of the large-scale, lensing structure.

*** Stanislav Mikheyev, 1940-2011
</h1> <p>
Stanislav Mikheyev, an outstanding experimentalist and one of the
inventors of the solar "MSW effect" died of heart attack on 23 Apr
in Moscow, aged 70.  Mikheyev was awarded the Bruno Pontecorvo
Prize (2006, jointly with Smirnov and Wolfenstein) and the Sakurai
Prize (2008, jointly with Smirnov).

*** ICARUS starts to fly
</h1> <p>
On 29 Mar, the Imaging Cosmic and Rare Underground Signals ICARUS
experiment was officially inaugurated at the Gran Sasso Lab of
INFN.
<a href="http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/45737">
http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/45737
</a>
ICARUS is studying neutrino oscillations in the Cern to Gran
Sasso beam (CNGS) as well as searching for other phenomena such
as nucleon decay.  It is the world's largest argon nu detector.

*** First results from T2K long-baseline neutrino experiment
</h1> <p>
T2K reported its 1st results on the search for excess e nus using
3.23 e19 of 1.45e20 protons on target.  They have 2 single-ring
e-like out of 33 fully contained events.  They expect 1.3 with
frozen cuts from the MC with oscillations and zero theta13.  One
event has a "decay" so there is one electron nu candidate.

*** Tau neutrinos in atmospheric neutrinos from Super-K
</h1> <p>
They see a fitted tau excess corresponding to 213.6 events, which
is 1.63 times the expectation based on oscillations.  The data
is inconsistent with no tau appearance at 3.8 sigma.  See slide
12 of Jeff Wilkes' talk at Neutrino Telescopes 2011:

*** NOvA far lab occupied in Northern Minnesota along NuMI beam
</h1> <p>
The University of Minnesota has taken possession of the NOvA Ash
River Laboratory with the issuance of an Interim Certificate of
Occupancy on 13 Apr.  Next is to build the 15 kiloton nu detector.
