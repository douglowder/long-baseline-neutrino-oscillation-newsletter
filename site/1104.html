<h2>Focusing on horns </h2>

<H1>
*** Horn designer Simon Van der Meer, 1925-2011
</H1> <P>
At the 1963 Sienna Conference Simon van der Meer wrote, "In view 
of enhancing the fluxes of high energy neutrinos required for 
experiments, it is useful to focus towards the neutrino detector 
the pi's and Ks produced by protons interacting in the target.  
The statistically determined change in direction of the neutrino 
with respect to its parent pion or kaon will set a limit to the 
precision of focusing that is useful."  A plasma device built
by Lederman for BNL didn't work.  Horns have gone on to enhance
neutrino fluxes at labs around the world.

<H1>
*** Horns at ANL
</H1> <P>
A horn was built for the nu experiment at ANL led by Telegdi, and 
then used for the bubble chamber.  A 2nd "reflector" was built to 
increase the flux 30% based on calculations by then-postdoc Phil 
Schreiner.  A power supply was ordered from Europe and arrived in 
the US but was destroyed when a truck took it under a bridge 
without enough clearance.  Walter Prague then made a power supply 
on his own.  Both horns operated for the rest of chamber's life.

<H1>
*** Horns at Fermilab
</H1> <P>
A horn focuses as many pions as possible in the forward direction,
to maximize the neutrino flux.  The first MINOS horn simulations 
used NUADA, a program that has a "perfect focus" option.  This put
all pions parallel at the center of the beam.  This is unachievable,
but by comparing the neutrino flux to perfect focus, there was a
meaningful figure of merit for any horn design.  Jim Hylen has 
kept the NuMI/MINOS horns working, and he recalls, "The best horn 
story I remember is Frank Nezrick showed me an inner conductor
they bent into an S shape (amazingly without breaking it) when the 
cooling failed on a horn test stand. Second best is the one I heard 
about them putting a bucket under the end of the horn at WANF, and 
periodically emptying it, after the water spray jet eroded through 
the inner conductor -- but the horn continued to run fine!"

<H1>
*** Horns in Europe
</H1> <P>
In the 80's & 90's, Stephen Rangod worked with Jean-Marie Maugain 
on R&D at CERN allowed for replacing coaxial cables with strip-
line bus bars for powering horns.  This allowed avoiding the high 
tension on the fragile horns, and was a big step toward more 
reliable operation.  In the 90s and into the 2000s, a fruitful 
collaboration was established between several labs interested in 
horn design, KEK, Fermilab and CERN, and later CNRS in France and 
others. This allowed injecting the latest developments into the 
horn design for CNGS. For example, the 7 m long inner conductor 
was built as one single piece, thanks to welding by electron 
bombardment.  Using glass as an insulator and graphite as seals 
have also allowed reducing the cost of horn construction. A semi-
rigid strip-line connection developed by CNRS Orsay and a water 
inlet coaxially inside the water outlet make the horn exchange 
somewhat easier, although this still remains a major operation.

*** South Pole Telescope search for neutrino mass
</H1> <P>
The Cosmic microwave background (CMB) was discovered accidentally 
in 1964 by Penzias & Wilson using a well-calibrated horn antenna.  
One device currently studying the CMB is the South Pole Telescope, 
a 10 m diameter wide-field telescope with a mm-wave bolometer 
camera.  The data will be used to characterize the primordial 
matter power spectrum.  A second-generation camera will measure 
the polarization of the CMB.  From the analysis of the resulting 
polarization maps, the project will determine the angular power 
spectrum of the CMB B-mode polarization (curl component) induced 
by the lensing of the intrinsic E-mode polarization (curl-free 
component) by large-scale structures. The lensing B-mode spectrum 
provides sensitivity to the nu masses through their impact on the 
growth of the large-scale, lensing structure.

*** Stanislav Mikheyev, 1940-2011
</H1> <P>
Stanislav Mikheyev, an outstanding experimentalist and one of the 
inventors of the solar "MSW effect" died of heart attack on 23 Apr
in Moscow, aged 70.  Mikheyev was awarded the Bruno Pontecorvo 
Prize (2006, jointly with Smirnov and Wolfenstein) and the Sakurai 
Prize (2008, jointly with Smirnov).

*** ICARUS starts to fly
</H1> <P>
On 29 Mar, the Imaging Cosmic and Rare Underground Signals ICARUS
experiment was officially inaugurated at the Gran Sasso Lab of
INFN.  
<A href="http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/45737"> 
http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/45737
</A>
ICARUS is studying neutrino oscillations in the Cern to Gran
Sasso beam (CNGS) as well as searching for other phenomena such
as nucleon decay.  It is the world's largest argon nu detector.

<H1>
*** First results from T2K long-baseline neutrino experiment
</H1> <P>
T2K reported its 1st results on the search for excess e nus using
3.23 e19 of 1.45e20 protons on target.  They have 2 single-ring 
e-like out of 33 fully contained events.  They expect 1.3 with 
frozen cuts from the MC with oscillations and zero theta13.  One 
event has a "decay" so there is one electron nu candidate.

*** Tau neutrinos in atmospheric neutrinos from Super-K 
</H1> <P>
They see a fitted tau excess corresponding to 213.6 events, which
is 1.63 times the expectation based on oscillations.  The data
is inconsistent with no tau appearance at 3.8 sigma.  See slide 
12 of Jeff Wilkes' talk at Neutrino Telescopes 2011:

*** NOvA far lab occupied in Northern Minnesota along NuMI beam
</H1> <P>
The University of Minnesota has taken possession of the NOvA Ash 
River Laboratory with the issuance of an Interim Certificate of 
Occupancy on 13 Apr.  Next is to build the 15 kiloton nu detector.
