*** Signatures solicited on neutrino LOI
</h1>It is important to convey to the HEPAP Subpanel, the potential 
strength of the community interested in accelerator-based neutrino 
physics beyond the next generation of experiments. A short letter 
of interest has been drafted, which can be found: 
<a href="http://www.fnal.gov/projects/muon_collider/nu/study/loi/loi.ps"> 
http://www.fnal.gov/projects/muon_collider/nu/study/loi/loi.ps </a>
Signatures are solicited from all (theory/experiment/accelerator
R&D) who want to be counted as having an interest in the long-term
neutrino physics program.   To be added to the provisional author 
list and associated email list, respond "yes" to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="f18296949483b1979f909ddf969e87">[email&#160;protected]</a>.

*** Signatures for Neutrino Magnetic moment 
</h1>If the neutrino has a magnetic moment, this electromagnetic 
interaction increases as log E.  Weak interactions increase at 
E, so searches should be at low energy.  The MUNU experiment at 
the BUGEY reactor is searching using low energy neutrino electron 
elastic scattering.  A preliminary new limit is < 1.9 10^-10 Bohr 
magneton.  They will run the rest of 2001.  Also, DONUT sets a 
limit 3.9 10^-7 for nutau's mu

*** SNO tells us nothing twice
</h1>SNO was hoping to give their neutrino flux at the Washington APS 
meeting, but instead in two large talks told us the answer would 
come soon.  They mostly measure nu d -> p p e which is CC, while 
Super-K measures nu-e elastic which is about 1 part NC to 6 parts 
CC.  Active neutrino oscillations should be as low as ~ 0.30 of 
the SSM rate, while SMA & just so ~ 0.45. (See 
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0103179"> hep-ph/0103179 </a>)
The problem may be agreeing on the systematic error.  SNO's next 
collaboration meeting is this month.

<p> <h1>
*** Experimental Cosmologists ignore neutrinos twice
</h1>The DASI and Boomerang data now see the 2nd and 3rd peaks in the 
cosmic microwave background power spectrum!  Both collaborations 
fit to 5% Baryons, 35% Cold Dark Matter and 60% Dark Energy.  
Asked about Hot Dark Matter, one speaker said it would be in 
their error budget.

<p> <h1>
*** Super-K now 1289.4 days, 79.3 kt-year
</h1>Sub-Gev R 0.638 +- 0.017 +- 0.050, Multi-Gev 0.675 +-0.033 +-0.08
Chisquared best fit is 132.4/137, while for no oscillations it is 
299.3/139.  stopping/through muons for Data/MC is 0.65 +- 0.04 +- 
0.09.  Best fit for dmsq is now 2.5 10^-3 eV^2 with the 90% CL 
between 1.7 and 4 with sin^2 2q> 0.89.  Solar neutrinos are .451 
+- .005 +- .016 compared to BP2000 with the 5.0-5.5 MeV bin.

<p> <h1>
*** Solar Constant variations
</h1>The solar constant is named because... Well it didn't change 
much.  John Bahcall has adopted the agreed upon average value 
from all the solar radiation satellites of the solar luminosity.  
So the published version of BP2000 has a 2% lower 8B flux than 
given at NOW2001 (5.15 to 5.05 10^6 /cm^2-s).  This will 
undoubtedly cause confusion when experiments compare to "BP2000".  

<p> <h1>
*** Super-K daily and seasonal variations
</h1>For Day/Night, they have 636 effective days at night (?!).  
[N-D]/[(N+D)/2] = 0.033 +- 0.022.  For seasonal variations, 
chisquared for eccentricity is 3.9/7 dof, for flat is 8.7/7 dof.  
Thus its the first observation of eccentricity using neutrinos.

<p> <h1>
*** Baikal up going neutrinos
</h1>Last year Lake Baikal neutrino telescope saw 35 neutrinos in 170 
days with NT190.

<p> <h1>
*** NuMI costs going up 
</h1>A DOE Lehman Review of the NuMI Project will be May 22-24 to 
consider increasing the baseline from $138M by about $30M.

<p> <h1>
*** Fermilab Brighter Booster workshop June 6-7.
</h1>Reaching and exceeding the NuMI design intensity of 3.7 10^20 
protons per year depends on an upgrade of the Booster.  A physics 
study has the goal of preparing a report for Snowmass.  Their web 
page is at 
<a href="http://projects.fnal.gov/protondriver/"> 
http://projects.fnal.gov/protondriver/.  </a>
A workshop is 
tentatively scheduled for June 6-7 at FNAL.  10 study groups.

Aesook 
Byon-Wagner thinks we need a similarly creative representation of 
leptons, and is sponsoring a contest.  Entries should be sent to 
her at mailto:<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="8be9f2e4e5cbede5eae7a5ece4fd">[email&#160;protected]</a> by 10-Jun for an unspecified prize.

*** Who runs the bar at Deep Space Ten?
</h1> You won't find the word neutrino in James Joyce.  But the word is 
used as the name of a town in Kabardino-Balkaria Russia.  Yes, it 
is near Baksan.  Also, QNX has an operating system for embedded 
devices 
<a href="http://www.qnx.com/literature/nto_sysarch/intro.html"> 
http://www.qnx.com/literature/nto_sysarch/intro.html </a>
and 
there is a band

A play in Theatre du Nouvel-Ontario called "Univers" muses on 
neutrinos and SNO (in French).  And a climbing company in France 
sells carabiners named 'neutrino'.  We can only hope they chose 
the name for its low weight not for its property to oscillate.
