SURF hosted its 15th annual Neutrino Day celebration, in Lead,
South Dakota, with a record-setting attendance of 2,000 visitors!

*** Did Einstein say that?  Facebook says yes.
</h1> <p>
A book for newly elected officials in Illinois quotes Albert
Einstein as saying, "the only reason for time is so everything
doesn't happen all at once".  That didn't sound like him, so I
looked online, finding at checkyourfact.com that a search of
80,000 Einstein archive documents found no mention of this quote.

*** Who named the neutrino?
</h1> <p>
A popular answer is Fermi, who did popularize the term.  But I
believe the correct answer is Amaldi, though Fermi was there.  I
learned this from Lincoln Wolfenstein, who could dramatically roll
his rrrrr as he pronounced it.  It is documented in Physics
Reports, Volume 111, pp1-331, September 1984, note 277.

*** Dedication of Stagg Field and Site A as APS Historic Sites
</h1> <p>
On 14 July this year, the American Physical Society dedicated
Stagg Field at the U of Chicago, and Chicago Pile Site A (AKA
Red Gate Woods) as APS historic sites.  CP1, the first self-
sustaining chain reaction, though only 200 W, was also the
first manmade (anti)neutrino source.  Lincoln Wolfenstein was a
Chicago undergraduate at the time, who walked by Stagg Field
every day.  He once said that if he'd known that so many neutrinos
were pouring out of Stagg Field, he would have crossed the street.

*** The NuFACT 2024 meeting will be in Europe
</h1> <p>
NuFACT 2023, the 24th International Workshop on Neutrinos from
Accelerators, is taking place in Korea, which is in Asia.

</a>
Meetings alternate among continents,
and NuFACT 2024 will be in Europe.  Candidate sites are in
Liverpool and Tel Aviv.  Despite the 2016 non-binding referendum,
Liverpool is in Europe.  And Israel is on the CERN council, so
that is in Europe too.  I've never understood why Europe and Asia
are separate continents, geographically or geologically.  And
Africa and America are named after Europeans, while Europe is
named after a mythical goddess from Phoenicia, which is in Asia.

*** Xenon Workshop in October at SLAC
</h1> <p>
<a href="https://indico.slac.stanford.edu/event/8015/">

</a>
A Workshop on "Xenon
Detector 0nu2beta Searches: (at) the KT Scale" will be 25-27 Oct.
A moment of discovery seems palpable — yet ... the dreaded curse
of unexpected radioactivity-induced backgrounds may still lurk.

*** US 2024 DOE Budget Outlook

"The administration has proposed rolling back some of increases
that certain research programs received in FY2023, accommodating a
ramp up in funding for HEP’s flagship LBNF/DUNE neutrino project."
and "DOE has also set out a funding profile for the project that
aims to enable the start of detector operations by 2029 and the
start of operations for the project’s nu beam from FNAL in 2031."
