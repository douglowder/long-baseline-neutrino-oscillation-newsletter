*** Neu2012 - Doing the best with Existing Infrastructure CERN
</H1> <P>
A summary of a very good discussion held on the future of nu physics 
in Europe.

*** Liquid Argon Purity Demonstration at Fermilab
</H1> <P>
The FNAL Liquid Argon Purity Demonstrator (LAPD) is designed to test 
whether the electro-negative purity necessary for drift distances 
of over 2 meters can be achieved in a liquid argon TPC without 
evacuation.  It is located in PC4 at Fermilab, the same hall where 
the Upsilon was discovered.  The first phase of the test is to 
show that the electron lifetimes can be achieved in an empty vessel, 
and the second phase will place materials similar to those planned 
for LBNE in the system and repeat the purity demonstration.  The 
LAPD vessel will hold 30 tons of liquid argon and is scheduled to 
begin filling in the middle of November 2010.

*** Long-baseline Antineutrino Plan Delay (LAPD) delayed
</H1> <P>
In the NuMI beam, MINERvA wants neutrinos, MINOS anti-neutrinos.
MINERvA has been given control of the beam tune until the end of 
the year, though there is a target leak now being fixed.  When 
MINOS takes control it will spend most of the time in low energy 
anti-neutrino running. NOvA, which will soon be operating the near
detector on the surface (NDOS) prefers neutrinos.  A likely
scenario is that NuMI will give NDOS 2E20 protons on target in 
neutrino mode and 2E20 protons on target in anti-neutrino mode.
This delayed plan might be delayed, as in September the target for
NuMI needed to be replaced.  NuMI is off; probably till November.

*** Large Area Picosecond Photo-Detector R&D (LAPPD)
</H1> <P>
The LAPPD Project has recently entered the 2nd year of its 3y 
timeline. The goal is to leverage advances in material science to 
produce large-area microchannel plate detectors with sub-mm, sub-
ns resolutions at low costs, scalable to neutrino and collider 
applications. The LAPPD has already demonstrated gains of 10^6 
from 33mm MCPs made using its fabrication method, vacuum seals in 
8 inch glass tubes, and time resolutions of a few picoseconds from 
its front-end electronics design. The time resolutions and fine 
spatial granularity within single detector modules have potential 
to improve tracking and particle ID capabilities in future Water 
Cherenkov-based neutrino detectors, and their high tolerance for 
magnetic fields  and compact design might reduce some engineering 
challenges of conventional PMTs. See

*** New theta_13 fit from KamLAND (or KamLAPD if isospin is good)
</H1> <P>
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.4771"> arXiv:1009.4771 </A>.
A three-flavor analysis with theta_13 as a free
parameter yields best fits on theta_12, dmsq_21 and sin^2 q13
= 0,020 +- 0.016.  A global analysis with CHOOZ, atmospheric and
accelerator data gives a nonzero value at 93% CL.

*** LBNE meets; still needs a name, but not LAPDog
</H1> <P>
There are several Long-Baseline Experiments.  D0 never got a name.  
One suggestion from Paul Grannis wasn't used, the dog logo was.

LBNE now has almost 300 collaborators from 47 institutions, and
even a few graduate students.  LBNE met at Fermilab in September.
Director Oddone came and talked about his upcoming decision on 
Run 3, and stated clearly that he would not sacrifice the future 
for Run 3.  LBNE is writing documentation for CD1, which it hopes 
to get next year.  The next meeting is 26-29 Jan 2011 at UCLA.  If 
there is a boring session, physicists could visit the LArge Plasma
Device (LAPD).

*** Neutrino Jobs, including a Louisiana (LA) Postdoc (PD)
</H1> <P>
<A href="http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/jobs/jobs.htm"> http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/jobs/jobs.htm </A>
is a compendium of job 
announcements used by 7 neutrino experiments.  A list of additions
is sent to collaboration lists every 3-6 weeks.  The removal of
listings is difficult.  For example, screening for a new T2K/LBNE 
postdoc at Louisiana State University started in August, but the 
job is not yet filled.  In the absence of a broken link, jobs are
left on the page 2 years.  Additions/Subscribers welcomed.

*** Large-area Avalanche Photo Diodes and neutrinoless beta decay
</H1> <P>
Neutrinoless double beta decay experiments need good energy 
resolution and large background rejection.  The NEXT collaboration
is building a 100 kg enriched 136Xe detector in the CanFranc Lab,
possibly with multi-pixel photon counters (MPPC) and large area
avalanche photodiodes (LAPD).  EXO200 at WIPP in New Mexico also
uses 136XE and has 516 200 mm^2 active area LAAPDs to detect 
scintillation light and provide a time-zero measurement.

*** Lindley's Antineutrino Particle Dilemma
</H1> <P>
MIT Physicist Lindley Winslow was awarded the L'Oreal USA
for Women in Science award for her work on Double Chooz.

</H1> <P>
They are heading a project (MiniCLEAN - Cryogenic Low Energy 
Astrophysics with Noble liquids) to make a direct search for WIMP
dark matter. MiniCLEAN will exploit a 500 kg, 150 kg fiducial mass
of LAr viewed by a spherical array of 92 PMTs and operating as a
single-phase detector. The conceptual simplicity of the approach 
aims toward the development of a multi-ton experiment capable of 
interchanging massive targets of LAr & LNe.  A related new program
applies LAr technology to the cause threat reduction owing to the 
capability to discriminate nuclear recoil events like fast 
neutrons when swamped in a intense signal of gamma/e background.
