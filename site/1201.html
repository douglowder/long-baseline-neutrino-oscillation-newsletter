*** LBNE will design a liquid Argon far detector, not water
</h1> <p>
The process for a technology decision in the LBNE project and
collaboration is now complete, and will be a liquid Argon TPC at
the 4850 level of Homestake.  This decision was the culmination of
a long process including a CDR review, which concluded that both
detector designs were sound and could be built and perform as
required; the Science Capabilities Review, which concluded that
both detectors "would make world-leading measurements relevant to
all of the major science goals," but which unanimously concluded
that the capabilities of the LAr detector exceeded those of the
WCD; and the recommendation from the EC in favor of the WCD.  The
Project Manager Jim Strait, considered all the input and chose
liquid Argon.  This has now been agreed to by all parties.
The U.S. Congress has asked for a report on LBNE progress by
1 April.  To meet this, Office of Science Director Brinkman
should decide no later than March whether to proceed at Homestake.

*** Theorists send support letter for a large detector
</h1> <p>
A group of particle theorists, wrote a letter to Dr. Brinkman
to emphasize the urgent physics need for having a large
underground detector in the US, linked to a long-baseline intense
neutrino beam as would be available from Fermilab.

*** Extension of Main Injector run to 30 April, 2012
</h1> <p>
The Fermilab Main Injector running has been extended from March 1
through 30 April, 2012.  This will allow additional running for
Minerva, and also the possibility that MINOS can install better
clocks, fibers, GPS devices for an improved neutrino velocity
measurement.  MINOS prefers an HE beam, to get high statistics at
the far detector for the v measurement.  Minerva prefers the LE
beam for its program to measure low energy neutrino interactions.

*** Pontecorvo award 2012 to Stan Wojcicki from Stanford
</h1> <p>
Wojcicki won the 2012 Pontecorvo prize.  This prestigious prize
was instituted in the memory of Bruno Pontecorvo in 1995.  Awarded
annually to an individual scientist, it recognizes "the most
significant investigations in elementary particle physics", as
acknowledged by the international scientific community.  The prize
will be announced by the JINR council on 17 February.

*** Double Chooz access issues
</h1> <p>
The Double Chooz experiment access is through a tunnel in which
some rocks have fallen, temporarily affecting the ventilation.
The experiment continues to take data, but some activities such as
calibration have been postponed until remediation efforts finish.

</p><h1>
*** Daya Bay progress
</h1> <p>
Two near detectors have been operating for several months, and at
least 3 of the 4 far detectors are installed.  All 8 detectors
should be operating this summer.  Results comparing the response
of the two near detectors might be expected soon, and will confirm
control of the systematic errors.  Six reactors are now operating,
2 Daya Bay, 4 Ling Ao; (unit 4 started Aug 2011).  Units 5 and 6
of Ling Ao phase III are under construction, due in 2016 (correction:
I am told Ling Ao III no longer exists).

*** December Fermilab PAC likes the nu program; not BooNE
</h1> <p>
LBNE is Good, NOvA is Good, Minerva is Good, MINOS+ Still Yes, but
even more so; MiniBooNE, SciBooNE, MicroBooNE - All good

</a>
But "the Committee did not see a strong argument in favor of
simultaneously operating two identical BooNE detectors in the BNB.
Not moving the detector either.  Workshops were suggested.

*** Short-Baseline Physics Workshop at Fermilab 21 March 2012
</h1> <p>
2 groups are invited: 1) A short baseline physics focus group,
short physicists interested in the length of baseball foul lines &amp;
2) A short-baseline physics focus group, interested in a new
generation of detectors and/or new types of neutrino sources that
would lead to a resolution of the existing tensions with 3-flavor
mixing.  Link at

*** Superluminal workshop
</h1> <p>
A January workshop on Superluminal neutrinos at APC was mostly
attended by theorists and a few experimentalists.  There were many
references to the OPERA result and the MINOS 2007 paper.  Talks
were mostly hypothetical stuff. Exotic possibilities are being
considered: nu speed unequal to antinu speed; speed depends on
direction; diurnal effect; Northgoing nu's(MINOS) subluminal,
Southgoing nu's (OPERA) superluminal, EWgoing nu's (T2K) null.

*** Two neutrino double beta decay seen in EXO-200
</h1> <p>
In
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.4193"> arXiv:1108.4193 </a>,
EXO-200 reports 2-nu double-beta decay in
Xe-136 at 2.11+-.21e21 y, a second order Standard Model process
not seen before.  It is now confirmed by KamLAND-Zen in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4664"> arXiv:1201.4664 </a>
2.38+-.14e21 y.  Two previous lower limits by others seem wrong.
