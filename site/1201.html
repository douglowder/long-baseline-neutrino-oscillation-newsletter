*** LBNE will design a liquid Argon far detector, not water
</H1> <P>
The process for a technology decision in the LBNE project and
collaboration is now complete, and will be a liquid Argon TPC at 
the 4850 level of Homestake.  This decision was the culmination of 
a long process including a CDR review, which concluded that both 
detector designs were sound and could be built and perform as 
required; the Science Capabilities Review, which concluded that 
both detectors "would make world-leading measurements relevant to 
all of the major science goals," but which unanimously concluded 
that the capabilities of the LAr detector exceeded those of the 
WCD; and the recommendation from the EC in favor of the WCD.  The
Project Manager Jim Strait, considered all the input and chose
liquid Argon.  This has now been agreed to by all parties.
The U.S. Congress has asked for a report on LBNE progress by
1 April.  To meet this, Office of Science Director Brinkman 
should decide no later than March whether to proceed at Homestake.

*** Theorists send support letter for a large detector
</H1> <P>
A group of particle theorists, wrote a letter to Dr. Brinkman
to emphasize the urgent physics need for having a large
underground detector in the US, linked to a long-baseline intense
neutrino beam as would be available from Fermilab.

*** Extension of Main Injector run to 30 April, 2012
</H1> <P>
The Fermilab Main Injector running has been extended from March 1 
through 30 April, 2012.  This will allow additional running for 
Minerva, and also the possibility that MINOS can install better 
clocks, fibers, GPS devices for an improved neutrino velocity 
measurement.  MINOS prefers an HE beam, to get high statistics at 
the far detector for the v measurement.  Minerva prefers the LE 
beam for its program to measure low energy neutrino interactions.

*** Pontecorvo award 2012 to Stan Wojcicki from Stanford
</H1> <P>
Wojcicki won the 2012 Pontecorvo prize.  This prestigious prize 
was instituted in the memory of Bruno Pontecorvo in 1995.  Awarded 
annually to an individual scientist, it recognizes "the most 
significant investigations in elementary particle physics", as 
acknowledged by the international scientific community.  The prize 
will be announced by the JINR council on 17 February.

<H1>
*** Double Chooz access issues
</H1> <P>
The Double Chooz experiment access is through a tunnel in which 
some rocks have fallen, temporarily affecting the ventilation.  
The experiment continues to take data, but some activities such as 
calibration have been postponed until remediation efforts finish.  

<H1>
*** Daya Bay progress
</H1> <P>
Two near detectors have been operating for several months, and at 
least 3 of the 4 far detectors are installed.  All 8 detectors 
should be operating this summer.  Results comparing the response 
of the two near detectors might be expected soon, and will confirm 
control of the systematic errors.  Six reactors are now operating, 
2 Daya Bay, 4 Ling Ao; (unit 4 started Aug 2011).  Units 5 and 6 
of Ling Ao phase III are under construction, due in 2016 (correction:
I am told Ling Ao III no longer exists).

*** December Fermilab PAC likes the nu program; not BooNE
</H1> <P>
LBNE is Good, NOvA is Good, Minerva is Good, MINOS+ Still Yes, but 
even more so; MiniBooNE, SciBooNE, MicroBooNE - All good

</A>
But "the Committee did not see a strong argument in favor of 
simultaneously operating two identical BooNE detectors in the BNB. 
Not moving the detector either.  Workshops were suggested.

<H1>
*** Short-Baseline Physics Workshop at Fermilab 21 March 2012
</H1> <P>
2 groups are invited: 1) A short baseline physics focus group, 
short physicists interested in the length of baseball foul lines & 
2) A short-baseline physics focus group, interested in a new 
generation of detectors and/or new types of neutrino sources that 
would lead to a resolution of the existing tensions with 3-flavor 
mixing.  Link at

*** Superluminal workshop
</H1> <P>
A January workshop on Superluminal neutrinos at APC was mostly 
attended by theorists and a few experimentalists.  There were many 
references to the OPERA result and the MINOS 2007 paper.  Talks 
were mostly hypothetical stuff. Exotic possibilities are being 
considered: nu speed unequal to antinu speed; speed depends on 
direction; diurnal effect; Northgoing nu's(MINOS) subluminal, 
Southgoing nu's (OPERA) superluminal, EWgoing nu's (T2K) null.

*** Two neutrino double beta decay seen in EXO-200
</H1> <P>
In 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.4193"> arXiv:1108.4193 </A>,
 EXO-200 reports 2-nu double-beta decay in 
Xe-136 at 2.11+-.21e21 y, a second order Standard Model process
not seen before.  It is now confirmed by KamLAND-Zen in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4664"> arXiv:1201.4664 </A>
2.38+-.14e21 y.  Two previous lower limits by others seem wrong.
