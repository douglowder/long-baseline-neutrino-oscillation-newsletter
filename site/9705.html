*** Minnesota legislature helps MINOS
</h1>The Minnesota legislature has approved $400K for MINOS.  The
funds are to be used by the Minnesota Department of Natural
Resources, which operates the Soudan mine for the tourists,
to do things like upgrading the cage for MINOS needs.

<p> </p><h1>
*** KEK now called K2K
</h1>The Long-baseline experiment which is being built from KEK to
SuperKamiokande, formerly known as KEK362, has taken the name
K2K, (for KEK to Kamioka).  A logos with a K2K in a yin and
yang type figure is also being considered.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Possible signal in LSND decay-in-flight (DIF)
</h1>In a paper sent to Physical Review C, LSND has shown evidence
for neutrino oscillations in addition to their earlier
decay-at-rest analysis.  Two separate analyses have ~24 nu_e C
events from 60 to 200 MeV.  The OR of the two analyses is 40
events, the AND is 8 events.  For the 40, they expect 12.3
cosmic background events, and 9.6 neutrino background events.
The nue--&gt;numu signal is P =2.6+-1.3 10^-3.  P-chance is quoted
as 1.1 * 10^-3.  The systematic uncertainty is dominated by the
nu_e C cross section, which was low when they measured nu_mu C.
Putting +10% -45% on that, they get a parameter space contour
which includes the decay-at-rest regions of m^2 and theta.

***   Kamland
</h1>An experiment to use the former Kamioka detector to search for
reactor neutrinos has been approved by the Japanese Government.
The group, led by A. Suzuki at Tohoku, will have 1000 ton of
liquid scintillator surrounded by 3.3 kiloton of mineral oil.
The Kashiwazaki reactor, 160 km away, would give 273 events per
year.  All are reactors would lead to 700 events per year,
(no oscillations).  They can get to dmsq 10^-5 eV^2.

<p> </p><h1>
*** First neutrinos in DONUT
</h1>The direct observation of the tau neutrino experiment, E872 at
Fermilab, has seen neutrinos from their target and has put in
three emulsion modules for a target as of May 14th.  So far
they have 7.48e16 protons on target.

<p> </p><h1>
*** New Soudan 2 result on atmospheric neutrinos
</h1>Soudan 2 has a new preliminary result from 2.63 kiloton-years
of atmospheric neutrino data.  The flavor ratio of ratios
is R=0.67 +-0.15 +0.04-0.06.

<p> </p><h1>
*** SuperK angular distribution of Multi-GeV data
</h1>The ratio of ratios for the SuperK Multi-Gev data is 0.52.
The zenith angular distribution is flatter than the previous
Kamiokande result, which suggested a neutrino oscillation effect.
Four statements which are all true:  1. "It's consistent with
flat." 2. "It's consistent with the previous Kamiokande result".
3.  "If you like, it's flat." 4. "If you like, it's sloped."
More statistics are needed, and are coming.

<p> </p><h1>
***  Nestor succeeds and fails
</h1>Nestor has deployed a frame with tubes at their site off the
coast of Greece.  They successfully put down a frame of tubes and
recovered it.  Everything worked fine mechanically.  But a piece
of electronics failed due to high pressure, and they did not get
any data during the exercise.

<p> </p><h1>
*** TOSCA/COSMOS
</h1>The Fermilab Short-baseline experiment, COSMOS, and the proposed
new CERN experiment, now called TOSCA, are competing experiments
which would run at the same time, and both use emulsion.   The
upshot of frank discussions between TOSCA and COSMOS collaborators
is that they will stay in touch, with a meeting in October at CERN
and another one at a later date in the U.S.   If either
experiment is significantly delayed, joint efforts are likely.

<p> </p><h1>
*** New Oak Ridge project
</h1>A workshop on neutrinos at National Spallation Neutron Source (NSNS)
was held at the intersections conference, Montana.  Using their
1 GeV proton beam which may come on in 2004, and two target
stations, they can do the Decay-at-rest experiment down to
10^-2eV^2 and 10^-4 in mixing.  A 1500 ton detector is being
designed, ORLANDO (Oak Ridge Large Area Neutrino DetectOr).
A collaboration will form at a 23-26 September workshop.
Their web page will be put on the neutrino oscillation industry
page http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/nuindustry.html
when it becomes available.

<p> </p><h1>
*** What is your model for negative neutrino mass squared?
</h1>Tritium beta decay experiments have been getting negative m^2
because they measure an excess of events near the endpoint
while eV neutrino mass would lead to a deficit.  It has been
pointed out that all four experiments (Troitsk, Mainz, LANL,
LLNL) are using different functional forms for the excess in
their fits.  Thus the values of -m^2 cannot be directly
compared with each other.
