Pushing the boundaries of perception
<br>BY ROBERT MCCOPPIN Daily Herald Staff Writer
<br>Posted Thursday, April 28, 2005
<p>A century after Einstein, a Fermi physicist uses relativity to explore
how the universe works
</p><p>Debbie Harris is shooting pool in the dark.
</p><p>Actually, she's part of a team of physicists shooting invisible particles
underground from Fermilab in Batavia to a detector in Minnesota.
</p><p>But like most particle physicists, she needs a good analogy to explain
bizarre, hidden worlds most of us can't comprehend. In essence, her experiment
is like shooting invisible cue balls into glow-in-the-dark billiard balls.
From the resulting collisions, she can figure out the size and energy of
the cue balls.
</p><p>She hopes to make scientific history by measuring the differences in
mass of these "cue balls - tiny objects called neutrinos.
</p><p>With this data, scientists hope to gain a deeper understanding of the
most plentiful particle with mass in the universe - a ghostly particle,
millions of which fly through each of us constantly.
</p><p>Such is the life of a particle physicist in the era after Albert Einstein
reinvented the field.
</p><p>One hundred years ago, Einstein burst onto the world stage by publishing
five papers that changed the way we think about the universe.
</p><p>This year, to commemorate that anniversary, Harris and three other physicists
from Fermilab are writing online diaries of what it's like to be a modern-day
physicist.
</p><p>Their stories reveal the challenges of trying to get ideas heard in
the scientific community, having to raise millions of dollars in funding
to do one's job and working on projects that can consume a decade.
</p><p>Harris in particular reveals the thrills and frustrations of a woman
in a male-dominated field, a mom juggling work and kids and the split personality
of a fun-loving person devoting her life to seriously deep thoughts.
</p><p>Quantum Diaries
</p><p>Collectively, the blogs are known as the Quantum Diaries. They are written
by particle physicists from 15 countries as part of the United Nations
World Year of Physics. It's an effort to put a human face on an esoteric
field.
</p><p>In her blog, Harris takes a feminist slant on the experience. She rebukes
recent comments by the president of Harvard about "innate" differences
between the sexes as a reason there are fewer women than men in physics,
and she encourages potential female scientists by speaking at schools.
</p><p>When Harris visited a second-grade class, she wore boots and jeans,
which one girl said made her look "like Elvis."
</p><p>The comment made Harris' day, but left her wondering: What do students
expect a scientist to look like? A man in a lab coat?
</p><p>Harris, 37, stands a lean 6 feet tall and has long dark hair, inquisitive
brown eyes and a broad smile.
</p><p>The daughter of a physicist father and a mother who is a French teacher,
Harris grew up in Glen Ellyn, not far from Fermilab.
</p><p>She started college at Cornell in upstate New York as a chemistry major,
but after taking a test so hard that a 29 was an A, she decided to go into
physics.
</p><p>She had worked as a student at Fermilab, where she liked helping make
detectors that could measure particles people couldn't even see.
</p><p>"That's when it first occurred to me," she said, "I could have a job
where I'm interested in what I'm doing, and not just to pay the bills and
have fun on the weekends."
</p><p>She got her Ph.D. at the University of Chicago. For five years she's
been working on her current project at Fermilab, called MINOS (short for
the Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search).
</p><p>At the same time, she has been writing proposals to get funding for
the next experiment, called MINERvA, to measure neutrinos even more precisely.
</p><p>To relax, she plays volleyball, reads fiction and plays folk music on
the mandolin, but spends most of her free time raising her children.
</p><p>Married to a physicist she met at Fermilab, she lives in Wheaton and
has two children - 8-year-old Isaac and 4-year-old Sonia. She calls being
a mother "by far the hardest job I've ever taken."
</p><p>That's saying something for someone who has to keep up with Einstein
at her day job.
</p><p>Childlike genius
</p><p>1905 is sometimes referred to as Einstein's "miracle year."
</p><p>That's the year Einstein, a clerk in a Swiss patent office who worked
outside the pre-conceptions of the scientific community, published five
ground-breaking papers.
</p><p>He explained that light behaves not just as a wave, but as a particle,
which won him the Nobel Prize. He found a way to measure molecules; he
postulated that atoms and molecules are in constant motion; he showed time
and space are not constant; and he showed matter and energy are interchangeable,
expressed as E=mc2.
</p><p>His theories helped lead to a century of high technology, from semiconductors
and lasers to the atomic bomb and nuclear energy.
</p><p>Experiments have proven Einstein correct repeatedly. The mass of the
sun bends starlight by warping space-time, and clocks flown in airplanes
at high speed run slightly slower than clocks on the ground, demonstrating
his theory that time seems to slow down as velocity increases.
</p><p>Physicist and award-winning author Brian Greene says it's impossible
to overestimate Einstein's impact.
</p><p>"He's the man who changed everything, the Babe Ruth of science," Greene
said. "He set up a framework that now guides us in our everyday work. Everything
we do has to be compatible with work he initiated on the theory of relativity
and quantum mechanics."
</p><p>Einstein performed many of his experiments using only his imagination
and math.
</p><p>Today's physicists, attempting to prove or disprove extensions of those
theories, depend on large, costly experiments like MINOS.
</p><p>Their work - counter-balanced by researchers who study deep space -
comes as physicists hope they're on the brink of the next frontier.
</p><p>Einstein's theories left several holes, primarily contradictions between
quantum mechanics, which explains forces at the subatomic level, and general
relativity, which describes forces on a large scale, such as gravity between
planets.
</p><p>The challenge now is to overcome those contradictions with a new "theory
of everything," to explain and unite all the known forces in the universe.
</p><p>Modern impact
</p><p>Scientists like Harris depend in particular on Einstein's theory of
special relativity. That's his deduction that the measurement of time and
space depends on your point of view.
</p><p>At the speeds humans experience, we don't notice such an effect. But
Harris works with subatomic particles, which travel so close to the speed
of light that time slows down for them.
</p><p>That is why she is shooting particles through solid rock all the way
to Minnesota - to give the neutrinos time to change states.
</p><p>Just as a quarter can come up heads or tails when it is flipped, the
neutrino has the potential to change into any of three states, or "flavors."
</p><p>By using quantum mechanics, which Einstein also played a role in developing,
Harris' team plans to calculate the difference in mass between the flavors.
</p><p>So why should we care?
</p><p>While MINOS has no immediate practical application, scientists believe
it's an important step toward further research in the field. High-energy
physics has led to advancements in things like medical imaging, which is
being used, coincidentally, in cancer treatment for one of the directors
of the experiment.
</p><p>But the goal of MINOS is to reveal basic information about what much
of the universe is made of - neutrinos.
</p><p>"If you want to understand the universe," Harris said, "you have to
understand the neutrino."
</p><p>Neutrinos play a key role in the creation of the elements. Because they
are born in the center of stars, they can reveal how the sun shines, and
tell us about distant objects like a supernova.
</p><p>When House Speaker Dennis Hastert and a host of dignitaries officially
launched the MINOS experiment last month, it had already been in the works
for 10 years. It involves 225 scientists and cost some $170 million in
tax dollars.
</p><p>Harris worries that such long-term experiments may keep some young students
away. But for her, the results reward her patience.
</p><p>As Harris first saw the curved lines on a computer screen showing the
neutrinos reaching Minnesota last month, she was thrilled.
</p><p>Days later, she was crushed when a sudden glitch halted the experiment.
</p><p>Pipes carrying water to cool the radioactive target have sprung a leak.
The leak poses no safety hazard, Harris said, but researchers have to figure
out how to fix or replace the device, which may take weeks.
</p><p>"The experiment is definitely in crisis mode ... people were walking
around with very gloomy faces," Harris wrote in her blog.
</p><p>Still, she remains optimistic that MINOS will recover to render years
of good data.
</p><p>Balancing act
</p><p>On a typically busy day, Harris steals glances at her laptop of tests
already under way.
</p><p>As a physicist, she's impatient for the next project to get going. As
a mother, she feels she's missing out at home after spending the second
weekend in a row at work.
</p><p>"I guess it's all in keeping a balance," she concluded. "If I only work
on the experiment that is starting up now, then how can the next experiment
happen in time? And if I spend all of my time with my kids now, then what
kind of physicist will I be when they eventually grow up and leave the
house?
</p><p>"On good days I feel like I get both balancing acts more or less right,
but nights like tonight I'm not so sure about that second one ... ."
</p><p>For a physicist trying to fathom the puzzle of raising children along
with the mysteries of the universe, every day is an experiment.
