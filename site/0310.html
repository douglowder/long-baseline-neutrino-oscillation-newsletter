*** JPARC neutrinos setback
</h1>
Japanese Council for Science and Technology Policy, Cabinet Office
(CSTP) recently evaluated the J-PARC neutrino project as a rank C
project (the lowest priority in the four steps of evaluation, S, A,
B, and C).  C means "needs re-consideration." 3 reasons given:
1. A question remains whether suitable prior evaluation was made
about the advance of the J-PARC second phase plan. (J-PARCnu had
been classified as one of the J-PARC second phase projects.)
2. In view of the present severe financial situation of Japan, a
question remains about whether a large amount of investment is
justified only from a viewpoint as basic research.
3. Concerns if there exists a domestic similar plan or domestic
facility where similar research can be conducted.
- There was better news from a subsequent meeting of Koshiba &amp; the
panel. The chair of the panel stated that if a concrete plan for
overcoming these difficulties is formulated, they'll reconsider.

*** DESY interest in JPARC-nu
</h1>
Whether or not a linear collider is built at DESY, there is a gap
in their physics program after the possible turn off of HERA.  At
a workshop to study new projects last month, there was intense
interest in contributing to the 2km detector for JPARC-nu.

*** NuMI target area completed
</h1>
Ragnar Benson completed the Target Area civil construction 10/20.  This
includes the MI-65 Service Building, the outfitting of the below grade
pre-target area, the below grade  support rooms, the Target Hall, and
the Target Shaft.  Fermilab took  beneficial occupancy of the area.
Installation work has begun.  MINOS area completion is due 1/31/04.

*** Abraham gives Fermi prize to Bahcall, Davis
</h1>
WASHINGTON, DC - On Wednesday, October 22, Secretary of Energy
Spencer Abraham presented the 2003 Presidential Enrico Fermi Awards
to neutrino physicists John Bahcall and Raymond Davis, Jr. and to
Seymour Sack.  This is one of the government's oldest and most
prestigious science and technology awards.  The winners receive a
gold medal and a citation signed by the President and Secretary of
Energy.  Drs. Bahcall and Davis each received $93,750, whose sum is
suspiciously close to 186,282, the speed of light in miles/second.

*** Abraham to unveil DOE facilities plan on November 10th?
</h1>
It has been reported that the Orbach facilities plan of the
Office of Science for the next 20 years will be released by the
Secretary of Energy on November 10th, followed by the signing of
Critical Decision 0 (permission to think) for one or more projects.
Several neutrino-related projects are on the HEP and NP lists.

*** Neutrinos at Reactors in the Land of Abraham (Lincoln)?
</h1>
A Letter from Fermilab and Argonne Directors to the Chairman of
Exelon (formerly Commonwealth Edison Nuclear) sought permission
for development of a reactor experiment (for theta_13) by a group
spearheaded by Jonathan Link.  They agreed to help develop one.
Ill. reactors under consideration at Byron, Braidwood, Lasalle.

*** Neutrinos at a Reactor on the coast of Brazil?
</h1>
Angra, located on the coast at Angra dos Reis (3 hours south of
Rio), contains a 4GW reactor and is surrounded by 400-600m hills.
The Brazilian community is enthusiastic and is working on a
proposal and cost estimate.  There is a hope that the civil
construction could be about half the cost of a similar US
project.  There is already good communication with the reactor
company so funding and construction could occur by 2006.

*** Neutrino Art
</h1>
The October Issue of Lufthansa Magazin includes several pages of
particle physics event displays as art.  Only one was a nu event.
Each nu experiment is encouraged to send me an event picture for
a collection to be put on

*** Neutrino Marketing
</h1>
"Most people look for the man in the moon.  Some look for
neutrinos," starts a bike advert on p39 of September's Atlantic
Magazine.  The ad mentions neutrino 4 times.  It even tells us
what one is (similar to an electron) but not much about the bike.

*** SAUND - looking for noisy neutrinos
</h1>
A neutrino induced shower with enough energy will make some noise
that microphones can detect.  A Study of Acoustic High Energy
Nu Detection (SAUND) is underway in the Bahamas using AUTEC,  the
Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center, using 7 hydrophones.
In 211 days, dolphins have been detected, but no clear nus.

*** Fermilab neutrino Long Range Plan Open Meeting November 7th
</h1>
At 10-12 and 1-3 on Friday November 7th, a committee which has
been looking at Fermilab's neutrino future will make some
presentations at Fermilab.  Gary Feldman is the chair.
