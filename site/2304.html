"Neutrino Meetings are Back! issue"

<H1>
*** ISAPP neutrino physics school in Varenna Italy, 27 June-6 July
</H1> <P>
The International School in AstroParticle Physics 2023 aims to
advance the young researchers knowledge about the current status
of research in the field of Neutrino Physics and Astrophysics.
It will be held in the beautiful small village of Varenna,
located in front of the Como Lake and surrounded by the Alps
scenario.

*** WIN2023 in Zhuhai China 3-8 July 2023
</H1> <P>
The 29th International Workshop on Weak Interactions and Neutrinos
(WIN2023) will be at Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU).  The workshop
aims to provide a forum for researchers from around the world to
exchange the latest developments and progress in the field of weak
interactions and neutrinos.   An excursion to see JUNO will be
offered.

*** ICISE Neutrino Workshop in Quy Nhon Vietnam 16-19 July, 2023
</H1> <P>
A Neutrino Workshop is being organized at IFIRSE, ICISE center,
Vietnam. The workshop intends to bring together experimentalists &
theorists to address the unsolved unknowns for the completeness of
the 3-flavor paradigm and beyond, to understand anomalies in and
tensions among experimental data, and to investigate possible
non-standard physics with current and future neutrino experiments.

*** PhD neutrino summer school in Copenhagen Denmark 17-21 July
</H1> <P>
The Niels Bohr International Academy (NBIA) invites PhD students
and advanced Master students to the International  Summer School
on Neutrinos: Here, There & Everywhere. This one-week school aims
to bring the participants up to date with the latest developments
in neutrino physics, from theoretical issues to experimental
results, including astrophysical and cosmological aspects.

*** SLAC Summer Institute in Palo Alto California 7-18 August 2023
</H1> <P>
The theme for SSI this year will be "Machine Learning Across the
Frontiers: Artificial Intelligence in Fundamental Physics".  These
SSI lectures will introduce methods for Artificial Intelligence
and Machine Learning and their successful applications across many
areas of fundamental physics.

*** NuFACT2023 in Seoul Korea 21-26 August 2023
</H1> <P>
The main goal of the workshop is to review the progress of current
and future facilities able to improve on measurements of the
properties of neutral and charged lepton flavor violation, as well
as searches for new phenomena beyond the capabilities of presently
planned experiments. Experimenters, theorists, and accelerator
physicists from all over the world will share expertise with the
common goal of reviewing the results of currently operating
experiments and designing the next generation of experiments.

*** AAP Workshop 2023 in York, UK 18-21 September 2023
</H1> <P>
The upcoming Applied Antineutrino Physics (AAP) Workshop will be
held in the historic city of York, United Kingdom, hosted by the
UK's Boulby Underground Laboratory.  The AAP workshop will provide
an excellent opportunity to review and discuss antineutrino
detection technology for applications such as reactor monitoring,
safeguards and geophysics, and aims to bring together scientific &
stakeholder communities.

*** NNN23 in Procida Italy 11-13 October 2023
</H1> <P>
The 22nd International Workshop on Next Generation Nucleon Decay
and Neutrino Detectors (NNN23) will be held in Procida, an island
near Naples. The main physics topics of the workshop include
searches for proton decay, CP violation in the lepton sector,
determination of the neutrino mass ordering, and observation
of neutrinos from core-collapse supernovae.

*** Neutrino Telescopes in Venice Italy 23-27 October 2023
</H1> <P>
The Neutrino Telescopes is a workshop that takes place every two
years. Its long tradition dates back to the 80's. After the online
edition of 2021 due to the pandemic situation, the XX one will be
held again in presence in Venice, at "Palazzo Franchetti" of the
“Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti”.
