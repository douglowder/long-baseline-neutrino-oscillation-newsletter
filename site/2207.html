*** Community Summer Study plans future of US HEP
</h1> <p>
The 2021/2022 "Snowmass" meeting took place in July.  See slides
at:
<a href="https://indico.fnal.gov/event/22303/timetable/?view=standard">
https://indico.fnal.gov/event/22303/timetable/?view=standard
</a>
The goal of the 2-y long process is to identify the most important
questions in HEP and the tools and infrastructure required to
address them.  At the meeting, all frontiers converged on
executive summaries representing the views of their communities
and provided input needed for P5.  In September a draft overall
executive summary should be available and in Oct/Nov an ~500 page
Snowmass Book will be finalized &amp; ready for submission.  The
Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel, a sub-panel of
HEPAP, will produce a strategic report for HEP by summer 2023.

*** DUNE passes important hurdle
</h1> <p>
In July, the LBNF/DUNE-US Project completed the CD-1RR review with
the very positive recommendation that the DOE should proceed to
request the formal step of CD-1RR approval.  There are a number of
good recommendations to prepare the project for the further
approval steps at CD-2 and CD-3.

*** Return of NNN 28-30 September 2022 in Hida Japan
</h1> <p>
<a href="https://www-kam2.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/event/13/  ">

</a>
The 21st workshop
aims to discuss future detectors for nu physics &amp; nucleon decays.

</p><h1>
*** Return of NuINT 24-29 October in Seoul Korea
</h1> <p>
<a href="https://nuint22.org/">

</a>
This is the 13th International Workshop on
Neutrino-Nucleus Interactions in the Few GeV Regions.

*** Long building at Argonne
</h1> <p>

Secretary of Energy
Jennifer Granholm came to ANL to dedicate the new Long Beamline
Building at the photon source.  Note that there is no hyphen,
since both the beamline &amp; building are long.  A hyphen is needed
in the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility and Short-Baseline Neutrino
Program since the neutrino, facility &amp; program aren't long/short.

*** Submarine Navigation with neutrinos
</h1> <p>
J. Prieto et al. in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09231"> arXiv:2207.09231 </a>
consider using a CEvNS
detector in submarines for neutrino Position, Navigation and
Timing.  They conclude that this application is in the limit of
being feasible, but could be realized after some reasonable
progress in source and neutrino detector technology.

</p><h1>
*** TRIDENT, a neutrino telescope proposed in the South China Sea
</h1> <p>
A detector near the equator would give a unique viewpoint of the
neutrino sky.  A site has been found above an abyssal plain at
a depth of 3.5 km.  The tRopIcal DEep-sea Neutrino Telescope is
described at
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04519"> arXiv:2207.04519. </a>

The Particle Data Group's 2022 version of the Review of particle
properties can be found at

Values can be
found in pdglive at

The best fits for
all 5 neutrino oscillation parameters are unchanged from 2021.

</p><ul>
<li> "A Call to Arms Control: Synergies between Nonproliferation
Applications of Nu Detectors &amp; Large-Scale Fundamental Nu Physics
Experiments",
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00042"> arXiv:2203.00042, </a>
Synergies include prototype Gd-
doped water-based and opaque scintillator test-beds, large area
fast position-sensitive PMTs, and the development of concepts for
underground kT-scale detectors for reactor monitoring.
</li><li> "Design Considerations for Fermilab Multi-MW Proton Facility in
the DUNE/LBNF era",
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08276"> arXiv:2203.08276, </a>
2 other whitepapers describe
a 2.4~MW upgrade for DUNE/LBNF featuring a 2 GeV extension of the
PIP-II linac and a new rapid-cycling-synchrotron. This compares
them, emphasizing the commonalities and tracing the differences to
their original design questions.
</li><li> "KATRIN: Status and Prospects for the Neutrino Mass and Beyond",
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08059"> arXiv:2203.08059, </a>
After 1000 days of data-taking, KATRIN's design
sensitivity is 200 meV at the 90% confidence level. This paper
describes R&amp;D to improve sensitivity, and other KATRIN goals.
</li><li> "DUNE Software &amp; High Performance Computing",
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06104"> arXiv:2203.06104, </a>
Existing software execution models require adaptation, similar to
other experiments in some ways, but in other ways unique to DUNE.
</li><li> "The European Spallation Source nu Superbeam",
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08803"> arXiv:2203.08803, </a>
This summarizes the design of the 5 MW ESSvSB experiment and its
synergies with nuSTORM and the Muon Collider.
