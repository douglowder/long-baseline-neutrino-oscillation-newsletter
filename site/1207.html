*** LBNE reconfiguration complete
</h1> <p>
The LBNE reconfiguration process is complete and the project has a
green light to move forward.  CD1 review which baselines the cost
is scheduled for later this year.  The plan is for a new beam from
Fermilab to the Homestake mine with a 10 kton liquid Argon TPC on
the surface.  Additional funding is sought from sources outside
the DOE which could build a near detector and/or put the detector
underground.

*** Hyper-Kamiokande open meeting 21-23 August in Tokyo
</h1> <p>
Hyper-K is designed to study nu oscillations, nucleon decay &amp;
astrophysical nus.  An open meeting for those interested will be

*** FNAL director's Letter to Europe for 10-12 Sep Krakow meeting
</h1> <p>
Oddone wrote to the European Strategy Preparatory Group, "FNAL's
intensity frontier program includes 2 major projects that work
synergistically: LBNE that will send a new neutrino beam to
Homestake (1300 km baseline); and the Project X accelerator and
experimental program that includes megawatt-class beams at several
energies. Both projects provide unequaled opportunity for
scientific discovery at the intensity frontier. International
collaborators would derive the maximum scientific benefit from
participation ... since a large fraction of the necessary
infrastructure will be provided."

*** Presidential neutrino scholar, MINOS NOvA LBNE's Mayly Sanchez
</h1> <p>
In recognition of past and future work on neutrino experiments,
Iowa State Professor Sanchez was honored as a PECASE winner. After
the 2012 NUFACT meeting, she joined other winners in shaking the
hand of President Obama.

*** NOvA lays and glues first planes for far detector
</h1> <p>
NOvA, the next long-baseline neutrino experiment, has started
construction in place of its far detector.  The first planes of
extruded plastic have been laid down and glued together.

*** New OPERA paper on neutrino velocity
</h1> <p>
There is a new version of the OPERA paper on neutrino velocity:
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.4897"> arXiv:1109.4897v4.  </a>
This is the update version of the OPERA
original version of September, already updated in November 2011
(but still with the wrong result on the neutrino velocity).   This
latter version has been resubmitted to JHEP and it should be
referenced for any citation of OPERA results on neutrino velocity.

*** Phased Ice-cube Next Generation Upgrade (PINGU)
</h1> <p>
PINGU is a plan to add 18-20 higher density strings in IceCube/
DeepCore to lower the threshold to about 1 GeV.  The effective
volume would be 10 Mton at 10 GeV, &amp; this would make the South
Pole experiment sensitive to matter effects &amp; oscillations.

*** Plans for NuSTORM, workshop 21-22 September at FNAL.
</h1> <p>
NuSTORM (Neutrinos from STORed Muons) is an idea for a single
baseline lower energy entry-level neutrino factory.  It requires
no cooling and thus no new technology.  A 60 GeV proton beam at
FNAL could hit a 100kW Target and feed a 3.8 GeV/c 150 m long
muon decay ring.  Short-baseline neutrino anomalies could be
studied.  A collaboration-building workshop at FNAL will be 21-22
Sep.

*** Community questions from NuFACT
</h1> <p>
Each year, the oscillation community asks itself questions at
NuFACT.  For 2013: 1) How long should T2K &amp; NOvA run?  2) What are
the sensitivities &amp; systematics for future facilities?  3) Can we
do precision without a ND? 4) What significance for hierarchy
comes from atmo &amp; cosmo experiments?  5) What do we learn about
Majorana nature of nus from hierarchy + 0nu-bb probes?  6) Can we
reoptimize design of future facilities for large theta13?  7) Are
off-axis beams interesting for large theta13?  8)  What is the
deviation of theta23 from maximality at future facilities?
9) What is the useful target precision for each mixing parameter?

In 1248, Konrad von Hochstaden, the Archbishop of Cologne started
a civil engineering project to build a Gothic cathedral.  In 1517
M. Luther announced a "new theory" and construction came to a halt.
In 1824, citizens raised $1B equivalent to resume construction;
finished in 1880.  Lessons:  need to transcend day-to-day
politics; phase n does not imply phase n+1; re-assess program based
on new developments; need community involvement.

*** NNN meeting 4-6 October at Fermilab
</h1> <p>
The 2012 international workshop on Next Generation Nucleon Decay &amp;
Neutrino Detectors NNN12 will discuss future large-scale detectors
for nucleon decay, neutrino physics, and related topics. The
meeting will focus on next-generation detectors and strategies for
advancing research on proton decay, accelerator, atmospheric,
solar, supernova, and reactor neutrinos as well as developments in
studies of neutrino interactions and searches for 0nu-bb decay.

*** Venus's transit of the sun and neutrino pop quiz
</h1> <p>
The best answer to "During the Venus transit of the sun, were more
solar neutrinos absorbed in Venus, or focused toward us by
gravity?" came from U Chicago's Matt Strait:  "Since Venus
didn't transit the core of the Sun, it didn't absorb any nus."
