*** Fermilab neutrino running curtailed
</H1> <P>
The FNAL operations budget is strained as funding to PIP-II, LNBF/
DUNE, mu2e, and other projects ramp up.  So beam will be severely
curtailed for the rest of the year.  Beam is now 5 days on and 9
days off until the start of the summer shutdown in July.  This
changes NOvA expectation from 6e20 to 5.3e20 POT this year.  It
also affects the beam for the NOvA test beam detector which just
started taking data.

<H1>
*** J-PARC neutrino running curtailed
</H1> <P>
On 24 Apr., it was observed that the field strength dropped by 2%
in one of bending magnets (B15D).  Upon investigation they
found insufficient insulation between conductors in coils of the
B15D. They suspended main ring operations.  User operation will be
resumed in the Nov., after the coil replacement in Sep.

<H1>
*** Symposium for the 10th Anniversary of J-PARC
</H1> <P>
The J-PARC facility started its operation of neutron beam facility
in May 08, mu facility in Sep. 08, hadron facility in Feb. 09, &
neutrino facility in Apr. 09.   The 3rd J-PARC symposium
(J-PARC2019) will be held 23-26 Sep. 2019 in Tsukuba, Japan.

*** Physics Opportunities in the Near DUNE Detector
</H1> <P>
Zenodo hosts conference slides, e.g. the 2018 Neutrino Conference:
<A href="https://zenodo.org/communities/neutrino2018/">
	https://zenodo.org/communities/neutrino2018/
</A>
Now the slides of the PONDD Workshop on physics opportunities at
@DUNEScience are now available on @ZENODO_ORG . Each presentation
has its own DOI, that can be used for citing the work.

*** Limits on sterile neutrinos from beta decay
</H1> <P>
In 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06787"> arXiv:1904.06787, </A>
Bryman and Shrock look at various particle
decays, as well as superallowed nuclear beta decays, to set
improved limits on Ue4^2 in the MeV to GeV mass range.

<H1>
*** White Paper from USQCD on neutrino-nucleus scattering
</H1> <P>
This program of lattice-QCD calculations is relevant to neutrino
experiments, becoming increasingly important on the timescale of
LBNF/DUNE and Hyper-K.  The US LatticeQCD collaboration classifies
the problems into 3 groups;  straightforward, challenging, & holy
grail.  The holy grail for nu-N scattering is controlled QCD
calculations of the axial form factors, resonance transition form
factors, and nuclear PDFs for 40Ar.

Don Lincoln has a series of short videos that answer questions
like this for the general public.

*** LBNF pre-excavation
</H1> <P>
Before you remove 800,000 tons of rock from the Homestake mine,
you plan the excavation.  The company is Kiewit.
