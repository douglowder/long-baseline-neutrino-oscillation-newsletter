<P>

*** ICFA neutrino Panel issues Report
</H1> <P>
The preliminary report from the Neutrino panel of the
International Committee for Future Accelerators (ICFA) was issued.
<A href="http://www.fnal.gov/directorate/icfa/neutrino_panel.html"> 
http://www.fnal.gov/directorate/icfa/neutrino_panel.html
</A>
You can download the report there, which starts with a neutrino
manifesto, reviews the current program, describes opportunities
in the near- and long-term, as well as next steps.  You can also
sign up for the ICFA-NEUTRINO-COMMUNITY email list.

<H1>
*** HEPAP P5 subpanel issues Report
</H1> <P>
The report was presented to HEPAP & approved.  Recommendations for
the future US program focus on long-baseline neutrinos.  There is
no plan B.  See 
<A href="http://usparticlephysics.org/p5/">  
http://usparticlephysics.org/p5/ </A>
and

*** P5 report recommendations 12, 13, 14
</H1> <P>
Recommendation 12-In collaboration with international partners,
develop a coherent short- and long-baseline neutrino program
hosted at Fermilab.
<br>
Recommendation 13-Form a new international collaboration to design
and execute a highly capable Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF)
hosted by the U.S. To proceed, a project plan and identified
resources must exist to meet the minimum requirements in the text.
LBNF is the highest priority large project in its timeframe.
<br>
Recommendation 14-Upgrade the Fermilab proton accelerator complex
to produce higher intensity beams.  R&D for PIP-II should proceed
immediately, followed by construction, to provide proton beams of
>1 MW by the time of first operation of the new LBNF.

<H1>
*** Reformulation is unreconfiguration
</H1> <P>
The LBNE collaboration proposed and costed a 34 fiducial kt liquid
argon detector underground at SURF with a fully capable near
detector.  The "reconfiguration" process led to CD1 for a 10 kt
surface detector with no ND.  P5 recommends the configuration that
LBNE wanted.  No new CD1 is required.

<H1>
*** LBNA to LBNZ
</H1> <P>
I was told that the NBI corporation 
<A href="http://nbicorp.net/"> nbicorp.net 
</A>
chose its name
from the acronym "Nothing But Initials".  I don't know if that's
really true.   The choice of the P5 panel to call a liquid argon
detector using a beam from Fermilab to SURF, the Long-Baseline
Neutrino Facility, rather than LBNE has led to a number of jokes
with at least 24 punchlines.  The Colliding Detector Facility
had to change name after 15y to the Collider Detector at Fermilab.

<H1>
*** CHIPS R&D Plan approved by Fermilab PAC
</H1> <P>
After the approval of the CHIPS R&D program, the collaboration are
ready to deploy a model detector in the Wentworth pit this summer.
On 28 July it will deploy 5 Ice-Cube DOMs and monitor cosmics &
light attenuation over the winter. The main goal is to understand
mechanical issues associated with such a detector at 60 m depth.

<H1>
*** More on CHIPS, RADAR, LAR1, NuSTORM, MAP (Reference p17 of P5)
</H1> <P>
These were called out by P5 as specific examples of large-scale
projects not recommended for funding in any budget scenario.
This doesn't apply to the CHIPS R&D program.  There will be a DOE
technical review in April 2015 to advise the agency and the
principals on next steps. Depending on the R&D program, which is
expected to take 3 years, and the size of any international
contribution, CHIPS could be part of the "small experiments"
portfolio endorsed by P5, or as a variant of the large water
Cherenkov detector addition to LBNF endorsed by P5 under "C".

<H1>
*** Towards figures-of-merit beyond the Standard Nu Model
</H1> <P>
Many neutrino reports of the last 10 y have content which is quite
similar, naturally.  Section 4 of the ICFA report does something
valuable which is new.  In 2 pages it tries to articulate the
goals of the program and the figures-of-merit against which
proposed contributions to the program can be judged.

<H1>
*** NOvA Near Detector sees the beam
</H1> <P>
The NOvA collaboration at Fermilab had previously run a Near
Detector on the Surface (NDOS) which took data for a couple of
years, and is finishing construction of its 14 kiloton Far
Detector, which has been measuring neutrinos from Fermilab since
November 13.  This month it turned on the first sixth of the new
Near Detector, which is built at the same off-axis angle as the
FD, and it has observed a timing peak from beam events.

<H1>
*** Supernovae (or is it supernovas) should be further than Mars
</H1> <P>
I was pointed to a website that tries to answer the question,
"How close would you have to be to a supernova to get a lethal
dose of neutrino radiation?"

*** Neutrino 2014, NNN2014, NOW2014, TAUP2015
</H1> <P>
<A href="http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/numeetings.html"> 
http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/numeetings.html.  </A>
If going to
Neutrino 2014, be aware that the Government Center T station
is closed.  This is not due to a government shutdown.
