*** NOvA on the go I, first far detector neutrinos
</H1> <P>
In some language, "nova" means "it will not go".  But the NuMI
Off-axis electron neutrino Appearance experiment aka NOvA, has
seen its first neutrinos from the NuMI beam in the far detector.
It had previously run for two years with a Near Detector on the
Surface (NDOS) and seen many thousands of neutrinos at Fermilab.
Using the time distribution of the NDOS events, NOvA showed that
it sees events which look like neutrinos at the right time in the
Far Detector.  NOvA is also building a near detector at the same
off-axis angle as the far Detector.

*** NOvA on the go II, beam and detector
</H1> <P>
In February the last plastic modules were shipped from the U of
Minnesota module factor, the last of its 28 "blocks" of plastic
extrusion detector was installed, which took 19 monhts.  Many of
the far detector modules still need to be filled with scintillator
& electronics installed.  The reconfigured Recycler successfully
sent 12 batches of slip stacked beam to the NuMI target.

*** Fire and Radiation incident at WIPP; EXO result
</H1> <P>
Two seemingly unrelated incidents have put the EXO neutrinoless
double beta decay experiment on hold.  In early February there
was a fire in a salt truck which led to the evacuation of the
Waste Isolation Pilot Plant.  Later in the month, some low 
but unexplained levels of radiation showed up on some monitors.
EXO has a supply of valuable xenon, but the recovery system worked
and the xenon is all safe.

EXO has shown a new
result with two years of EXO-200 data.  Limit is 1.1 10^25y,
based on 99.8 kg yr of Xe-136 exposure.

*** Three neutrino flavors, not just two
</H1> <P>
While the two neutrino formula works surprisingly well, it is
only an approximation and there are three neutrinos.  MINOS, which
has the world's best value of delta msquared_32, has a new paper
with a three neutrino analysis combining beam and atmospheric
neutrinos.

*** Neutrino School in Denmark 23-27 June 2014
</H1> <P>
Laertes shouldn't go to Paris, just to the Neils Bohr Institute.

*** Sterile neutrino report I from astrophysics
</H1> <P>
Two papers 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2301"> arXiv:1402.2301 </A>
& 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4119"> arXiv:1402.4119 </A>
discuss a unexpected
possibly monochromatic x ray line seen in XMM data (European x-ray
telescope).  One paper combines data from Andromeda and Perseus,
the other stacks 73 clusters of galaxies correcting for redshift.
They see a 3.5 keV line which might be due to 7 keV nu decay.

<H1>
*** Sterile neutrino report II from astrophysics
</H1> <P>
Some recently published papers show that some tension in Planck
data with the lambdaCDM model can be alleviated with sum of nu
mass about .46eV and a .43eV sterile.

*** A neutrino physicist moves on
</H1> <P>
After working on Ice-cube and Double Chooz, Michelangelo
D'Agostino spent a year working on software for the Obama 2012
campaign.  Now he does data mining for Braintree.

*** A neutrino physicist thrives
</H1> <P>
Lisa Whitehead, who has worked on T2K, Daya Bay, MINOS, MINOS+
and LBNE, was named Woman Physicist of the Month by the American
Physical Society for March 2014.

*** A neutrino physicist skeptical of sterile nus changes his view
</H1> <P>
I used to be skeptical of accelerator and reactor based sterile
neutrino interpretations. One argument is that almost any mistake
in a neutrino experiment can be interpreted as a sterile neutrino.
I must now widen that point-of-view to include astrophysics.

<H1>
*** UK neutrino physicists join LBNE
</H1> <P>
The Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment (LBNE) is gaining
international support, including the membership of 41 people
from 10 institutions in the UK.  Some in the UK are also
interested in CHIPS and Hyper-K.

*** LBNE Cryostat success
</H1> <P>
LBNE has exceeded a purity goal using a prototype 35 ton membrane
cryostat.  The oxygen goal is less than 200 parts per trillion of
Oxygen, which translates to an electron lifetime of 1.5 ms for the
3.5 meter drift.  The measured electron lifetimes were > 2.5 ms.
