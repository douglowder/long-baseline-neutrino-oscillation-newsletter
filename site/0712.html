*** UK budget cuts - but they continue Neutrino Research
</H1> <P>
The UK Science and Technology Facilities Council recently had to
deal with a significant cut in research spending in the UK.  One
consequence was pulling out of the ILC.  Here is what they wrote
about neutrinos in their 2008-2012 Delivery Plan, "The recent 
discovery that neutrinos (a type of fundamental particle) have 
unexpected and unique properties, may ultimately account for the 
very existence of our Universe. UK researchers have played an 
important role in these discoveries. There are a range of 
opportunities for taking this area of science forward, including a
programme of neutrino experiments building on the MINOS project at 
Fermilab in the USA, leading to the T2K experiment in Japan, due 
to come online in 2009; a programme of R&D for the SuperNEMO 
experiment, which will test whether neutrinos and anti-neutrinos 
are actually the same thing; and continuation of the MICE
experiment which is addressing some of the technical challenges in 
the design and construction of a neutrino factory, which will 
fully uncover the neutrino.s properties. We will decide through 
the programmatic review our strategy for further investment in 
this area. The level of future funding will be dependent on the 
success of our restructuring plans."

*** US Budget Cuts, 
</H1> <P>
The President, House and Senate each proposed a large increase for 
High Energy Physics spending in Oct 07-Oct 08 Budget, but couldn't 
agree on the rest of the budget.  So HEP got a cut in an omnibus 
bill, passed 2 weeks ago.  NOvA, ILC & ITER got ~$0.  In the DOE 
Office of Science, the Bush plan was +16%, House +19%, Senate 
+18%, final +2.4%.  For the National Science Foundation, Bush 
asked +8.7%, Senate +10.8%, House +10.0% and the final +2.5%.  

<H1>
***  NOvA gets 0 this year.
</H1> <P>
Ironically, NOvA had just jumped a hoop, passing its "External 
Independent Review".  The EIR review found its cost & schedule are 
conservative and contingency is more than adequate, and planning 
"exemplary."  They concluded that the project is ready to be 
baselined once findings are addressed.  An effect of the cuts is 
an immediate stop of NOvA work at Fermilab, where staff will move 
to other projects.  Fermilab is working to explore possible ways 
to mitigate problems.  NOvA is not canceled.  FNAL will work with 
the community, P5 and HEPAP to make a compelling roadmap that the 
DOE & congress will approve for next year.  

<H1>
*** No cuts in 08 running at Fermilab for MINOS, MiniBooNE
</H1> <P>
At a December 20 all hands meeting, FNAL's director says they will
run the accelerator at planned levels in 2007-2008 for MINOS, 
MiniBooNE, SciBooNe ... Layoffs are being considered.

<H1>
*** Fermilab, Steering away from the Iceberg
</H1> <P>
The effect and morale at Fermilab and other HEP groups in the 
US is pretty sour.  Fermilab director Oddone has to make some
tough decisions, but also will work with with administration 
and congressional officials to "steer the ship away from the 
iceberg."

*** GLACIER & other Liquid Argon detector R&D
</H1> <P>
There are several initiatives around the world to study the 
possible use of small, medium, large and gigantic liquid argon
detectors for neutrino research.  One is GLACIER or Giant Liquid
Argon Charge Imaging ExpeRiment in Europe.  A new page at the
neutrino oscillation industry web site is devoted to liquid
argon detector research.  Additions/Corrections always welcome.

*** Glaciers do make progress (or how to influence people)
</H1> <P>
Back in 1994, the Drell panel was charting the future of High 
Energy Physics after the demise of the SSC.  The following is a
portion of a letter that Bjorken wrote to the panel, "...I think
the appropriate solution to this problem is for Fermilab to
aggressively expand and diversify its scientific progress.  Even
glaciers are known to undergo surges, where the flow unexpectedly
quickens for a while to an extraordinary degree...There is plenty
of motivation for a long-baseline neutrino oscillation 
experiment, but it is caught in the glacier despite PAC/lab in-
principle endorsement."  MINOS, which was approved to eventually
get 3.7 10^20 protons per year, has now passed 3.7 10^20 protons
on target, and has accomplished many of its goals.

*** Interested in future neutrino experiments at Fermilab?
</H1> <P>
Despite the setbacks, there will be a future neutrino program at
Fermilab.  And there is a neutrino working group for the 2nd
Workshop on Physics with a high intensity proton source
25-26 January 2008, led by Bonnie Fleming (Yale) and Ed Kearns
(Boston).  To get on the list, send
