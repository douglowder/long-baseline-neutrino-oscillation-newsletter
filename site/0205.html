<p> <h1>
*** Solar Angle is not maximal
</h1>
The most recent solar fits point to the Large Mixing Angle solar 
Solution (LMA) but apparently not maximal mixing.  For example, a 
fit by Smirnov gives a best fit to (Dm^2)_12 = 6.2 10^-5 eV^2 and 
tan^2 theta_12 = 0.40, ruling out maximal mixing more than 3 sigma.

<p> <h1>
*** New results and results we knew (at Neutrino 2002)
</h1>
Neutrino conferences happen every two years.  But most results in 
between are reported in between.  Most of us heard the exciting 
new SNO neutral current result before.  One new result involves dark 
matter, Edelweiss ruling out most all of the DAMA allowed region.

<p> <h1>
*** K2K fits to Delta m-squared
</h1>
This long-baseline neutrino experiment in Japan finds a best fit 
to oscillations with maximal mixing and (Dm^2)_23 = 2.8 10^-3 eV^2.

<p> <h1>
*** Two sources, one solar neutrino flux.
</h1>
Reporting the ratio of measured to expected phi_pp, Kirsten was 
asked where we get expected phi_pp.  His answer was, "from god or 
John Bahcall."  It was pointed out that some do not believe in 
god.  During a later talk, Bahcall reported this was the first 
neutrino conference in 40 years where there is greater belief in 
the audience about the solar model than there was on the podium.

<p> <h1>
*** Two numbers from KamLAND, no answer yet.
</h1>
They showed 11 anti-nu_e candidates, with R^2< 5m^2. 
These are excellent candidate events from faraway nuclear 
reactors. The also now have ~1600 hours of livetime.  The two 
numbers don't correspond to each other, though.  

<p> <h1>
*** Two Homestake letters, one with intent
</h1>
Ken Lande received a letter dated April 8th requesting he remove
the historic Chlorine detector from the mine.  Data taking has 
ceased and all counting of previous data is now terminated, but 
negotiations to keep the detector in place continue.  He also 
proposes a 10x larger detector with more extractions.  An LOI
for long-baseline from Brookhaven to Wipp (2880km), Soudan 
(1770km), Homestake (2540km) and others is at

<p> <h1>
*** Two beta decay, no neutrinos
</h1>
At Nu2002 there was widespread skepticism about the reported 
indication for 0nu double beta decay.  The discussion after 
"Neutrinoless double beta decay: review and future" was lively & 
interesting, in part because it included much periphery (such as 
calling people "commissars" and delays in publication).  A reply 
to a comment on the result is 
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0205228"> hep-ph/0205228.   </a>
It ends "We think 
it remains useful and inspiring to have informed the neutrino 
community about our evidence for a 2.2-3.1 sigma result ..."

*** Two detectors in one (NuMI) beam?

<p> <h1>
*** Continued work toward neutrino factory
</h1>
The Muon Collaboration discussed a number of issues at
Shelter Island, May 8-15.  New developments include a planned
proposal for a Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE), 
which will be sent to Rutherford Lab, new results on 
radiation produced in rf cavities, and tests of windows
for liquid hydrogen absorbers.  Simulations with realistic 
6D cooling channels that generate longitudinal cooling are 
giving good results - for different geometries.  Work on 
targetry and cost reduction is also proceeding.
