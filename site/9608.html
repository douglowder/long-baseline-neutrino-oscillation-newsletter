*** New long-baseline idea -- high resolution target
</h1>Niwa from Nagoya is considering the design of a 1 kiloton
iron/emulsion sandwich detector for a long baseline experiment.
It would be 1 mm iron and 1 mm emulsion, with a tracking
detector every 10 cm.  Angular resolution would be 1 mr, and
taus could be picked out by their impact parameter.  Backgrounds
from secondary interactions and nue induced charm are less than
1 event in 4 years of the Fermilab to Soudan beam.  Limits down
to sin^2(2theta) of 8 10^-3 would be expected.

*** Soudan 2 atmospheric neutrino result</h1>
The final result of 1.5 ktyr analysis of the Soudan 2 atmospheric
neutrino anomaly was presented at the Minneapolis DPF meeting
by Hugh Gallagher.  The flavor ratio is obtained after a
background subtraction based on penetration depth.  The result
is 0.72 +- 0.19 (stat) + 0.05 - 0.07 (other syst) where the
statistical part includes the errors from Monte Carlo statistics
and the background subtraction.  A paper is in preparation and
will be available soon.

*** Minneapolis meeting and tour</h1>
Transparencies from the 1996 DPF meeting are available on the
web.  Talks from the neutrino session can be found at

*** Bruce Baller joins NuMI; other progress</h1>
Bruce Baller has been appointed MINOS project manager at Fermilab
and will join the NuMI group shortly.  Meanwhile the NuMI stub
in the Main Injector has been finished.  A schedule 44 for
FY98, "Engineering and Design for the facility" is in the hands
of the DOE and is expected to be included in the next budget.

*** Ominous outyear HEP budgets</h1>
US long-term budget projections have no force of law, but are
often used as starting points for planning purposes.  These
outyear figures are the worst ever; 35% real decrease between
now and 2000 for DOE general science programs.  In a letter to
Fermilab's UEC, Director John People's outlines possible
consequences of such a budget, including, "the NuMI project would
either be canceled or delayed by many years."   The DPF, the APS
and others are trying to educate congress on the disaster this
would be for all scientific research in the US.  see

*** Democratic Convention</h1>
Some of this newsletter was written at the Democratic Convention,
where I was a delegate in the Illinois delegation.  While both
President Clinton and Christopher Reeve advocated increases in
scientific research, the context of both statements was medical.
The only mention of basic science (besides my own) which I heard
was by Senator Carol Moseley Braun in remarks to the Illinois
caucus, where she praised Argonne and Fermilab.  I planned to
hold up a sign saying Nu(mu) --&gt; Nu(tau) on the convention floor,
but was too busy dancing the Macarena.

*** Jobs at MINOS institutions</h1>
Oxford has a "Research Officer" position for someone with a few
years postdoctoral experience.  Email 
for more information.  Cal Tech is seeking a postdoc to work on
MINOS and/or MACRO.  Contact 
Argonne has postdoctoral positions to work on Soudan 2/CDF.
Contact  for more information.

*** MINOS steel and detector choices</h1>
MINOS has been considering three steel designs for its detector;
strip laminate, pi laminate, and spiral disk.  A committee on
steel options chaired by Lincoln Read recommended to the August
MINOS meeting that only the reference design (strip laminate)
be pursued.  Also, a Detector R&amp;D Advisory Committee had its
first meeting.  They are charged to give MINOS advice on choosing
its active detector.   About four meetings are planned, with a
decision due in August '97.    Choices include Iarocci tubes,
RPC's (glass or ABS) and scintillator (liquid or solid).

*** Parabolic horn</h1>
A group from Protvino has undertaken an independent review of
the NuMI beam design.  One object of study, previously built for
the 70 GeV beam at IHEP, is a parabolic horn.  This has a similar
B versus r profile as a Lithium lens; this would be useful to
consider for the narrow beam beam.  See the note below.
