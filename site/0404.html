<h1>Long-Baseline news,  April 2004 <br>
Groucho Marx edition^* </h1>

<p> <h1>
*** Where is the MINOS Near Detector?
</h1>
Starting on March 31st, it is in the MINOS near-detector hall, 
when the first plane was installed underground and about a 
quarter of the 282 planes were installed during April.

<p> <h1>
*** What's the name of T2K?
</h1>
The JPARC accelerator has been called JHF, HIPA and now JPARC.  
The long-baseline neutrino experiment has been called things like 
JHF2K and JPARCnu and other combinations, but is now commonly 
(though not officially) being called T2K (T is for Tokai) in 
apparent symmetry with K2K. 

<p> <h1>
*** What's the Name of NoVA?
</h1>
The "NuMI off axis" experiment, which Fermilab's PAC evaluated 
this month, chose the name NOvA, with the "v" being drawn as a 
neutrino when possible.  This won a naming contest with nominees 
"CaNOE", "NEAT", "NOAXE" and "03 (pronounced "oh cubed").  Gary 
Feldman from Harvard and John Cooper from FNAL are spokespersons.  
NOvA received a favorable response after a FNAL PAC presentation.
They wrote:  "NOvAs expected sensitivity is approximately the 
same as that anticipated by T2K Phase I and could be accomplished 
on roughly the same time scale.  However, because NOvA will have 
a longer baseline, it will be more sensitive to matter effects 
that may help to resolve the mass hierarchy.  NOvA should be able 
to resolve the mass hierarchy for a small range of parameters."

<p> <h1>
*** If the target will melt, why not use a liquid target?
</h1>
Neutrino factories and superbeams under consideration will put 
more power than ever onto a target.  Some of the research 
involves innovative target designs, such as liquid Mercury jets.

<p> <h1>
*** What is theta_13?
</h1>
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/nucl-th/0404059"> nucl-th/0404059 </a>
unambiguously predicts 0 <= sin^2 2 q_13 <= 1!

<p> <h1>
*** How Big is a Three Sigma Effect?
</h1>
High Energy Physicists usually mean, "...corresponding to a chance 
probability for a 3 sigma Gaussian distribution, whatever the 
true probability distribution function." But is it significant? A 
hint?  evidence?  an indication?  That's for the reader.

<p> <h1>
*** Which hole did the electron neutrino go through?
</h1>
Maybe the answer is 0.5 |1> + 0.5 |2>  A similar answer will have 
to be given for the 
<a href="http://www.science.doe.gov/Sub/Facilities_for_future/20-Year-Outlook-screen.pdf"> 
DOE Nuclear Physics 2011 </a>
goal "Establish a 
mass for the electron neutrino".

<p> <h1>
*** Overheard at SAGENAP
</h1>
"The Andes mountains are not for looks.  Its a neutrino target."
and "The detectors are cow proof."

<p> <h1>
*** If nothing came before the big bang, what's before a Supernova?
</h1>
If the precursor to a supernova is big enough and close enough, a 
detectable signal in a neutrino detector might show up from 
Silicon burning, giving an approximately two day 'warning'.
Out to 2 kiloparsecs, GADZOOKS would get 3 sigma.

<p> <h1>
*** What do you hear from HARP?
</h1>
First results were presented at Moriond.  12.9 GeV p's on Al (K2K 
conditions).  When the final result is available the neutrino flux 
uncertainty in K2K can be reduced.  Thursday afternoon 1st talk:

<p> <h1>
*** Minerva Approved
</h1>
This proposal for a high resolution near detector in the NuMI 
beam has received Stage I approval from Fermilab.  One issue is 
interaction with MINOS (use of muon information from the near 
detector, additional upstream events...) etc.

^* In his television show, "You Bet Your Life", Groucho Marx 
would ask seemingly easy questions if a contestant would 
otherwise leave without winning $. eg: What animal is bull-headed?
