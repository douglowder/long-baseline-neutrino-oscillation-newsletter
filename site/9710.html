***  NOE CERN-Gran Sasso long-baseline experiment adds TRD's
</h1>The 4kT calorimeter (CAL) made of crossed layers of scintillating
fiber embedded in extruded plastic (doped with iron ore) now is
interleaved with a "lighter" detector section, 2kT Transition
Radiation Detectors (TRD).  Both TRD and CAL modules joined
together form the Basic Module of NOE.  Twelve Basic Modules make
6.3 kT NOE.  Combining the information coming from both TRD and
CAL, improves e,mu,pi discrimination, useful for different
neutrino oscillation channels. In addition, since the transition
radiation detector consist of several layers of proportional
tubes, dE/dx using sampling-FADC's can be used for muon energy.
A TRD + CAL prototype test has been recently approved and founded
by INFN.  See http://www.na.infn.it/SubNucl/accel/noe/noe.html.

*** December Workshop "News about SNUs"
</h1>A solar neutrino workshop will be Dec. 2-6 in Santa Barbara.   It
will provide an opportunity for astro-, nuclear and particle
physicists, to assess where we are and where we might be
going. Questions include: The standard solar model: its
uncertainties, its connections to the general theory of stellar
evolution, and its seismology.  The current status of neutrino
detectors SuperKamiokande, SNO, GALLEX/SAGE, Chlorine, Borexino,
and Iodine. Prospects for HERON, ICARUS, and HELLAZ. New neutrino
phenomena, their manifestations in solar neutrino experiments,
and their implications for particle physics and cosmology and
related phenomena.  Info - Dorene Iverson ().

*** HANUL, a new underground magnetic neutrino telescope
</h1>A new neutrino telescope experiment, HANUL (High energy
Astrophysics NeUtrino Laboratory, also means 'sky' or 'heaven' in
Korean), is being planned in Korea.  This telescope is to detect
and measure upward going muon neutrinos.  Existing or proposed
experiments measure muon angle but they measure muon energy only
via range for contained muons.  HANUL will measure the muon
momentum via a conventional magnetic spectrometer, measuring
energy of muons from ~1GeV to several TeV, and separate neutrinos
from antineutrinos.  HANUL detectors will be installed on the
ground in an array.  HANUL will study atmospheric neutrinos, look
for galactic and extragalactic neutrino sources, WIMP (in
particular neutralinos) signals, and also TeV gamma ray sources
and gamma ray bursts.  The HANUL collaboration consists of several
universities in Korea and a few in the US.  Prototype construction
is expected to start before the end of this year.

*** Caveats
</h1>This newsletter reports facts and rumors as one individual hears
them, and should not be taken too seriously.  But be assured that
all nu rumors, regardless of their effect on the stock market
(and sometimes even their accuracy) will be promptly reported.

*** Public Radio visits Soudan/MINOS on Halloween
</h1>American Public Radio newscaster Kalleher visited the Soudan mine
on 10/31 to hear about neutrinos from Fermilab, from cosmic rays,
proton decay, and other physics news that the public wants to
hear about.  The Halloween tie-in leads us to suspect that some
of the conversation will be about the local bat population.

*** Highest Energy Cosmic Rays from neutrino induced Z's?
</h1>If neutrinos have non-zero mass, then high energy cosmic
neutrinos will annihilate on the nonrelativistic relic
antineutrinos (or vice versa) if the energy is within 3%
of 4 (eV/mnu) * 10^21 eV.  This will make Z's via the Glashow
resonance at that energy.  Two papers below (Weiler , Fargion et
al.) show how this can explain events above the
Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cut-off at 5 10^19 eV.

<p> </p><h1>
*** No sunspot cycle solar neutrino variation?
</h1>A common problem with data analysis is to construct a test of the
null hypothesis after the data is in hand.  This was done when it
was "noticed" that some solar neutrino data showed solar cycle
correlations.  Given that, it is now surprising that a
statistician claims that the anti-correlation was based on a
statistical fallacy.  See Walther's paper below.
