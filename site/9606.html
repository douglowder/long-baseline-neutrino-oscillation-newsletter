*** Neutrino '96 Highlights; Gallex, SAGE, SuperK, LSND, Karmen
</h1>Gallex reports that the solar neutrino flux has fallen in run III.  The
average Gallex flux over all runs is 70 +/- 8 SNU.  SAGE finds 72 +/- 17
SNU.  These results are still consistent with enough pp neutrinos but too
few nus from other processes.  Super K has seen the solar neutrino peak.
Beautiful pictures from SuperKamiokande was the highlight for many.
The LSND detection centers on a region in parameter space that limits to
delta(m**2) = 0.1 for sin**2(2 theta) = 1 and sin**2(2 theta) = 8e-3 for
large delta(m**2).  There are 2 problems with this result.  KARMEN doesn't
confirm the detection, although the parameter space for the 2 experiments
are not completely overlapping.  This result is also inconsistent with
heavy element synthesis in supernovae without invoking sterile neutrinos.

*** Blois Highlights -- Moessbauer summary
</h1>At the Recontres de Blois Rudolf Moessbauer emphasized in his summary talk
the importance of what he called "very long-baseline" experiments. By that
he did not mean accelerators of astrophysical origin, but experiments that
can close the gap in mass differences between the short baseline
accelerator/reactor and the solar neutrino experiments.  He pointed at the
Fermilab-Soudan project as well as the CERN-GranSasso project as being the
most promising experiments to shine light on the question of nu masses.

*** Very Very Long-baseline?
</h1>How long is long?  Well the largest distance you should imagine is
d = vt where v is c and t is the lifetime of the universe.  This is
6000 Mpc or 2 10^26 m.  There is increasing speculation that gamma
ray bursters are cosmological and have neutrinos accompanying them.
Tom Weilert is working on this neutrino source, and has suggested
starting a "very long-baseline neutrino newsletter"

*** Martha Krebs dramatically dons MINOS t-shirt
</h1>DOE assistant secretary Martha Krebs who visited Soudan last
month then went to the June Fermilab User's meeting where, to
thunderous applause, she put on a MINOS t-shirt in front of
the Fermilab User Community.  A photograph appears in the 6/15
issue of Ferminews.  She listed the Fermilab Neutrino
Program as forefront physics for the next decade, along with
the Main Injector, SLAC's B factory, RHIC, CEBAF and the
separately listed LHC participation.

*** Sagenap says terminate DUMAND
</h1>The DOE Scientific Assessment Group for Experiments in Non-
accelerator Physics (SAGENAP) report recommended no further
support for DUMAND.  Citing the track record to date, they
thought the ocean environment was too unforgiving.  DUMAND
has 3 strings of phototubes they are now unable to deploy.
The committee was also positive about DOE support for
MACRO, Milagro and Superkamiokande, and mixed about Soudan 2.
Positive things were said about AUGER but eyebrows raised
about costs.  Further consideration awaits their proposal.

*** Nu Industry
</h1>The web page of the neutrino oscillation Industry
http://www.hep.anl.gov/NDK/Hypertext/nuindustry.html
has a nice link from Juha Peltoniemi with results from nu'96
at http://neutrino.pc.helsinki.fi/juha/neutrino.html

*** NuTEV starts taking data
</h1>On May 28 at 5:40 AM NuTeV saw its first CC event.  Their
first "pings" arrived on June 4.  On June 5 at 5:12AM they
saw the first dimuon event.  Clearly 5AM is prime time for
neutrino hunting.

<p> </p><h1>
*** First results from CHORUS
</h1>CHORUS finds no kinks in the first lot of emulsion that they
have scanned.  From this, they can set a limit on P(numu to
nutau) less than 0.015, or sin^2(2-theta) 0.03.  This is not
an improved limit, but is a demonstration of principle that
CHORUS can achieve their goals.  One new wrinkle is that the
expected rate of nutau events in the beam (compared to numu
events) is &lt; ~ 10^-5, not &lt; 2 10^-7 as in the proposal.  This
is based on an improved B(Ds -&gt; tau), and a full Monte Carlo.
