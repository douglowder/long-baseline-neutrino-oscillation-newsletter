<p> </p><h1>
*** Emulsion Experiment considering Gran Sasso
</h1>With the decision at CERN to concentrate on the Gran Sasso
direction rather than the Jura for future neutrino experiments,
the OPERA collaboration, who is proposing an emulsion-steel
sandwich detector for tau identification, is now planning a
similar experiment in the Gran Sasso.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Rename the Neutrinos?
</h1>Taking a lesson from the Mars landing and their folksy naming of
the rocks near the lander, DOE's Director of Particle and Nuclear
Physics Peter Rosen has challenged the HEP community to come up
with better names for the quarks and leptons.  Long-baseline news
notes that the names of the three neutrinos are particularly
lacking in originality.   New names or nicknames for the
neutrinos are solicited.  Peter Rosen has offered a prize, "the
value of which will be announced at the appropriate time."  (Who
says that he's new to Washington?)  Good ideas will be mentioned
in long-baseline news whether they win or not.  The combination
of Hilary, Newt and Trent has already been suggested.

*** Fermilab User's Meeting
</h1>The Users meeting included a tour of the Main Injector, where 320
of the 350 dipole magnets are already in place, and the tour
included the new NuMI stub, in which protons start their trek
towards Minnesota (no road sign in place yet).  In director John
People's report, he noted that 1) Final engineering design for
NuMI is in FY98, 2) MINOS and COSMOS R&amp;D end in 98,
3) Construction for the neutrino beams and enclosures will start
in FY99 if funding plans developed by FNAL/DOE are adhered to.
4) MINOS and COSMOS detector construction will start in 2000.
5)Beams before 2002.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Nu-TeV taking good beam
</h1>NuTeV has been getting 6 10^16 protons per week.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Gilman panel to hear about Neutrinos August 12th.
</h1>According to its draft schedule, the HEPAP Gilman subpanel on
the future of HEP in the US will hear about Fermilab's neutrino
program, NuMI, MINOS, COSMOS and Boone from 2:40-4:20 on
Tuesday Aug 12th at Fermilab.

<p> </p><h1>
*** No near detectors at CERN?
</h1>The long-baseline proponents from CERN to Gran Sasso have yet to
be convinced of the necessity of a near detector.  This may be
related to the funding negotiations regarding what gets put in
the cost of the beam.   It makes planning for the short baseline
experiment, TOSCA, a little more complicated.   If the whole
thing proceeds as a package, funds for digging the
short-baseline hall will have to be identified.

<p> </p><h1>
*** HEPAP walks its dog.
</h1>During HEPAP's July review of the Fermilab program, one HEPAP
member questioned whether another review of the neutrino program
was needed.  After reviewing the conclusions of the Sciulli
HEPAP subpanel, and the HEPAP transmittal letter, all concerned
were satisfied that the approved MINOS and COSMOS experiments
were being pursued by Fermilab and the DOE as they were supposed
to be.  During some discussions, the metaphor of a dog was used,
but this was understood differently by different people.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Reference links on web version of this newsletter?
</h1>Should Long-baseline news try to provide links for the
references on its web version?  It would be some extra work, and
the links probably wouldn't all be accurate for very long, but
if there is sufficient interest, it could be done.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrino Oscillation Industry Page Improved
</h1>The neutrino page www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/nu_industry.html
has been split up into separate pages by topic to improve
response time.  Additions are always welcomed.
