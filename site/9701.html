<p> </p><h1>
*** Building a tunnel to the 21st century
</h1>He didn't mention it in his inaugural speech, but Bill Clinton's
budget for 1998 is expected to have $5.5M for NuMI A&amp;E, to design
the neutrino beam line at Fermilab for the short and
long-baseline neutrino beams.  A congressional battle is
unlikely, but who knows.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Chorus and Nomad results</h1>
Chorus and Nomad now have exposures of 3.3 10^19 and 2.0 10^19
pot respectively, compared to their original proposals 2.4 10^19.
They both have one more year approved and have requested that
CERN not dismantle the beamline during analysis.  NOMAD has
measured 700 nu-e CC events.  Their Ee, Ehad and phi(mu-had)
distributions look like expected from Monte Carlo, but the
phi(e-had) distribution is wider.  The missing pt is .78 GeV
in their data and .63 in the Monte Carlo.  Based on 20% of their
data, tau--&gt; e, --&gt;mu, --&gt;pi modes, they set a limit about the
level of E531 with 0 events seen, 0.5 background expected.  They
also exclude numu to nue with LSND's P down to 10 eV^2.  CHORUS
has zero tau--&gt;mu candidates based on 17% of their final data after
scanning 8000 events.  The 1994-95 run had 470K interactions.

*** CERN neutrino futures - Short, Long and Medium.</h1>
Short-NAUSICAA combines the kinematics of NOMAD and the background
rejection of CHORUS by using a Boron Carbide-Silicon target.  In
September they will test an emulsion target.  There is also a
proposal for a ICARUS-like  liquid Argon TPC in a Narrow-Band Beam.
Long - ICARUS and NOE at Gran Sasso
Medium - P304 (CERN/SPSLC/96-58) proposes a detector in the JURA,
17 km from CERN, which could measure 400,000 events including
11,000 Quasielastic events.     Another idea by Ludevici and
Zucchelli (see below) is for a numu to nue experiment using
an anti-tagged beam from the PS.  This would reduce nu-e/nu-mu
beam backgrounds from 10^-3 to 5 10^-5.  They could measure
112 events if LSND is right.

<p> </p><h1>*** DONUT adds shielding</h1>
Initial particle flux measurements at the location of the
emulsion in the nutau appearance experiment indicated a charged
particle flux above expectations.  Suspects included low energy
photons from neutrons.  A review held January 10th has become a
continuous process rather than an event.  Additional shielding
has cut down on the neutrons.  The remnant background may
represent photons from muon bremstrahlung.  Additional shielding
and a lead box around the emulsion should solve this problem.

<p> </p><h1>*** Main Injector fixed target workshop in May '97.</h1>
A workshop on "Fixed Target Physics at the Fermilab Main Injector"
will take place at Fermilab 1-4 May.  3 neutrino physics working
groups are being considered;  Short-baseline Oscillations,
long-baseline Oscillations and Non-oscillation physics.
Rudi Thun and Juan Jose Gomez are cochairing the short-baseline
working group.  Doug Michael and Andre Rubbia are cochairing the
long-baseline working group.  Jorge Morfin and Panagiotis
Spentzouri will co-chair the non-oscillation neutrino physics
working group.  Other working groups:  K+-'s, K0's, Multiparticle
Dynamics/Spectroscopy, Test Beams and New Detector Technology.

*** Workshop on Cosmic Neutrinos in Marseille in June</h1>
A workshop organized on HIGH ENERGY COSMIC NEUTRINOS:  ORIGIN,
PRODUCTION AND DETECTION will be held at the Centre de Physique
des Particules de Marseille (France) from Mon June 2 to Tue
June 3, 1997.  The aim is to review the progress made in the
knowledge and in the detection of mechanisms involving very high
energy particles, with a special emphasis on neutrinos.
The program will cover (1) Galactic Sources, (2) Extragalactic
Sources, (3) Search for Dark Matter and (4) High Energy Neutrino
and Photon Detectors.   See http://cppm.in2p3.fr/workshop.html

*** Do Supernova neutrinos oscillate?</h1>
Last month I discussed supernova neutrinos in order to point out
that the distinction between wavepackets and plane waves matters
there, though it doesn't for solar, reactor and accelerator nus.
If the nu mass is .001-1 eV, neutrinos when they get here will be
mixed but will not oscillate.  There are four caveats.   I did not
mean to imply that neutrinos don't oscillate near the source,
where there is a rich oscillation phenomenology.  I wasn't
considering nus in gravitational fields, about which there is some
confusion and controversy in the literature.  If dmsq is low
enough (below 10^-16 eV^2) wavepackets may overlap, though if its
too low there isn't much mixing.  Finally if dmsq is small
compared to both masses (i.e. degenerate neutrinos) the
wavefunctions overlap for dmsq above 10^-16 eV^2 as well.

*** Taiwan reactor neutrino project being investigated.</h1>
A project based on the nuclear reactors on the north coast of
Taiwan is being considered.   Mountains and tunnels are in place.
