</p><h1>FNAL Neutrino Oscillation Review</h1>
Fermilab has scheduled a neutrino oscillation
program physics and technical review for June 9th and
10th.  Proposals 803, 822, 860 and 872 will present
their goals, along with discussions of neutrino programs
at CERN, BNL and Los Alamos, beam and debuncher issues,
and theory.  The committee includes Ray Brock, also on
the PAC and the chairman, A. Bodek, S. Errede, P.
Nemethy, G. Fisk, A. Para, J. Strait and S. Parke.  One
goal is for the PAC June meeting to have available
information about the physics justification and
technical feasibility of a Neutrino Oscillation program.
One scenario is that the committee asks a number of
tough questions for the various experiments, for the PAC
to decide that there should (or shouldn't) be a neutrino
oscillation program in Fermilab's future in June, and
for the experiments themselves to be considered at the
PAC meeting in October.  That would suggest, for
example, that a full proposal rewrite should be done
over the summer.


<h1>Baton Rouge Workshop</h1>
Baton Rouge Workshop on Atmospheric Neutrinos
was held in early May.  Discussions went far beyond the
ratio of ratios, including experimental issues (energy
distributions, angular distributions, non-quasielastic
fractions, alternatives to neutrino oscillations and how
they fit the data, thresholds, e/mu separation) and issues
which affect the theoretical calculations (k/pi ratios,
absolute flux normalization, nuclear effects,
geomagnetic effects, quantitative comparison of various
calculations...)  There was "new" data from Frejus,
which had increased their fiducial volume and thus their
exposure from 1.5 kt-year to 2.0 kt-year.  They maintain
that a separate contained ratios should not be quoted for
their data since their uncontained events are clearly due
to neutrinos.  However, their "contained" ratio of
ratios went from .87 +- .17 to .87 +- .13.
If there was a conclusion to the workshop, it was
that a firm explanation of the atmospheric neutrino
deficit does not exist.  Neutrino oscillations was
certainly a favorite hypothesis.

<h1>Phys. Rev. Paper knocks 822</h1>
The paper below by Dimopoulos Hall and Raby specifically
mentions 822 as an experiment that can't measure the
neutrino oscillation parameters they predict.   Two
things make that more than of passing interest:  First
of all Larry Hall is on the Fermilab PAC, and also they
are incorrect in that 822 (in the long run) could
measure their predicted nu-mu to nu-tau mixing angle of
.03.  Further communication on 822 capabilities has been
send to these authors.  Babu and Mohapatra predict an
even easier to see .14.

<h1>Beam exit predicted</h1>
Surveyors meet at Soudan site.
Hugh Gallagher recently calculated the beam exit diagram
on a map for a 1 mr beam to Soudan.  Surprising to some
of us was the fact that such a beam has exited the earth
somewhat before the Soudan site.  The center of the beam
exit is just on the other side of Lake Vermilion where
Pine Island meets Trout Lake.  (Those of you who haven't
done so can visit this area on the mail boat.)  A crew
of Fermilab surveyors visited Soudan in late May with a
GPS system that they tied in to several markers in the
vicinity of the mine.
