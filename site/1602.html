<H1>Long-Baseline news, February 2016 </H1>
<P> 

<H1>
*** Can the LIGO result be explained by neutrinos?
</H1> <P>
No.  They would travel between Livingston Louisiana and Hanford
Washington in the same time as gravitational waves.  But they
wouldn't affect a Michelson Interferometer.  Could neutrinos come
along with the gravitational waves?  Maybe some could be emitted
during a black hole merger.  But 1.4 Billion light years is a lot
of one over rsquared.

 Why not look (a statement,
not a question.)
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05411"> arXiv:1602.05411.  </A>
Antares and Ice-Cube looked
within 500 s of the 14 Sep event and found 0 and 3 events, none
pointing to GW150914 and consistent with atmospheric background.

*** Neutrino Statistics?  A meeting in japan 30 May - 1 June.
</H1> <P>
Neutrino rates used to be low.  Now we're either better or smarter
or both.  But with higher rates come more statistical issues.
PhyStat-nu will address statistical issues in the broad range of
modern neutrino physics, including making measurements of model
parameters, setting limits, discovery criteria, discrete choice of
models, Bayesian vs. frequentist inference, and combining
experiments.  There will be a 2nd workshop at Fermilab 19-21 Sep.

*** Third International Meeting for Large Neutrino Infrastructures
</H1> <P>
This meeting which will discuss international cooperation for
future neutrino experiments will be 30-31 May at KEK Tsukuba
campus.

*** NuSTEC NEWS to replace nu-xsec newsletter
</H1> <P>
In 2016, the nu-xsec newsletter became a part of NuSTEC news.
The new e-mail address is <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a8c6dddbdccdcb85c6cddfdbe8cec6c9c486cfc7de">[email&#160;protected]</a>. <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7f110a52070c1a1c3f0e120a13511e1c510a14">[email&#160;protected]</a>
will soon be gone.  Subscribers have been transferred to the new
list, but email

Meanwhile, the long-baseline neutrino newsletter is unchanged.

*** DUNE prototypes
</H1> <P>
A 35-ton liquid Argon prototype detector which was built at FNAL
has been filled with liquid Argon.  Contamination is low so the e
lifetime is long, tracks have been seen, and shifts are continuing
to study noise rates and other issues.  A dual-phase liquid Argon
prototype at CERN, formerly known as WA105, is now part of DUNE,
Dual-phase protoDUNE.  There is also work going forward for a
Single-phase protoDUNE.  The EHN1 building extension for these is
underway.

*** Notation change for mixing angles?
</H1> <P>
Stephen Parke writes, "Why do we label the mixing angles 12, 13 and
23?"  Theta_13 isn't the mixing between physical
mass eigenstates nu1 and nu3; it's the
mixing between nu_e and nu_3.  He suggests:
<br>
theta_e2 instead of theta_12
<br>
theta_e3 instead of theta_13
<br>
theta_mu3 instead of theta_23
<br>
Then U_e2 proportional to sin theta_e2 & similarly for e3 and mu3!
There is the cos theta_e3 in two of them.  It would be hard to
make notation changes but it's at least worth a discussion.

<H1>
*** Thanks to Tom Kafka for years of references
</H1> <P>
Tuft University's Tom Kafka has provided a digest of neutrino
articles from the arXiv each month for about 20 years which
has been used for "Notable New References" below.  Now Tom has
retired and it is appropriate to thank him for his years of work.
I have a strict 112 ASCII line limit each month, so something
that seems notable one month might not make it another month.  But
feel free to let me know if I've missed something.

<H1>
*** Neutrino Physics Center
</H1> <P>
Fermilab has started a Neutrino Physics Center to help foster
communication among nu experimentalists and theorists at FNAL.
The center has a new fellowship program; apply by 18 March.
