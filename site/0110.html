*** Neutrinos in HEPAP Subpanel report
</h1>The Draft report on US HEP planning was encouraging or
discouraging with respect to its 84 mentions of neutrinos,
depending on expectations.

The 20 year "roadmap" includes a neutrino superbeam, a neutrino
factory, and a muon collider.  But you don't go everywhere on a
map.  Icecube and a national underground science lab are endorsed.
Specifically, in A.2.1 and A.2.2, a neutrino superbeam cost was put
at $500M, and a neutrino factory "significantly more than $1B."
More generally, it states, "The future neutrino program will be
shaped by the results from the present generation of experiments."

<p> </p><h1>
*** HEPAP subpanel urges NuMI completion
</h1>In Draft Section 2.5.1, the subpanel urged "projects under
construction, such as LHC and NuMI/MINOS be completed as
scheduled."  Didn't anyone tell them?

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrinos for National Security
</h1>Spencer Abraham, US Sec. of Energy, says the mission of the DOE is
"national security".  And "(science) programs and projects that
fall outside this mission will not receive my support for funding
without a clarity of mission and compelling circumstances."

<p> </p><h1>
*** Can underground physicists find Osama bin Laden?
</h1>If Mr. Laden is a subscriber, please respond.  There is a message.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Tamura Neutrino School
</h1>The Tamura International School on Neutrino Physics will be held
November 23-25, 2001 at the Seminar House of Tokyo University of
Science.  See

<p> </p><h1>
*** Homestake Underground Lab moves up
</h1>At the NUSL meeting in Lead South Dakota, the issue of prior
liability seemed to be a hang-up for Homestake mining company to
turn over its mine for a national underground science laboratory.
This issue was resolved after a meeting between SD Senator Daschle,
Governor Bill Janklow and Homestake President Jack Thompson.  The
indemnification agreement that would limit civil liability for
environmental problems at the mine to $75M needs congress' nod.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Homestake visitors solar modulated?
</h1>The number of signers of the guestbook by year at the Chlorine
Solar Nu Experiment: 2 (1980), 19(81), 10(82), 6(83), 6(84),
1(89), 2(90), 6(92), 5(93), 4(2000), 75 so far (2001)

<p> </p><h1>
*** 3M
</h1>This would be a Megaton Modular Multi-Purpose Neutrino Detector,
made from 10 (50-m)^3 cylinders at 6950 ft deep at
Homestake, for pdk, UHE nu's, atmo nus and long-baseline.  $10M
construction and about $30M for phototubes each.

<p> </p><h1>
*** KATRIN Letter of Intent
</h1>With the compelling evidence for massive neutrinos from recent
neutrino-oscillation experiments, one of the most fundamental
tasks of particle physics over the next years will be the
determination of the absolute mass scale of neutrinos. The
absolute value of nu-masses will have crucial implications for
cosmology, astrophysics and particle physics.
A next Generation Tritium Beta Decay Experiment with sub-eV
Sensitivity for the Electron Neutrino Mass has written a letter
of intent,

*** Greg Bock new Project Manager for NuMI/MINOS
</h1>Dixon Bogert now deputy for conventional construction.

<p> </p><h1>
*** CPT violation
</h1>If CPT is violated, there could be 6 neutrino masses, (rather
than 3) and hence many more interesting delta-msquareds.  CPT
violation would motivate many more long-baseline experiments.

*** New and Old Tests for Neutrino Mass
</h1>Two new preprints
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0109027"> hep-ph/0109027 </a>
and
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0110061"> hep-ph/0110061 </a>
discuss the
time between gravity waves and supernova neutrino bursts.  It is
noted that one of these two was published in 1981.
