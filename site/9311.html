</p><h1>Fermilab Calls for Proposals@
Long Baseline Experiments
The PAC recommended to the laboratory at the November meeting
that it issue a Call for Proposals for long baseline neutrino
oscillation experiments, and at an all-experimenters meeting on
20 November, Associate Lab Director Ken Stanfield said that
Fermilab would do that, though the specifics aren't worked out.

</h1><h1>822 PAC presentation@
Our first PAC presentation on 12 November concentrated on the
physics motivation for a long baseline experiment, and on
electron neutrino backgrounds and differences in the energy
spectrum for the near and far detector.  We have yet to receive
any formal feedback, but informal feedback was quite mixed.
Some have expressed the view that a long baseline neutrino
oscillation program is important physics to pursue now, while
others have their doubts.  Some continue to doubt that we
have systematic effects under control, but the view has also
been expressed that we are overengineered for this experiment.
Some feel that a new coarser detector is needed, while others
assert there is no money for a new detector and the statistics
that 822 can achieve is adequate for the most important
sections of parameter space.
<p>
We expect to get the PAC report soon.  We have been told that
there are further questions, and that answers to these questions
are due January 11th for the February 11th PAC meeting.  The
document submitted in October did not have a full story on the
near detector design, and more work is clearly needed on toroid
magnet and muon chamber designs.

</p></h1><h1>E--803 receives Stage One Approval@
The Short Baseline Experiment made a strong case that
they could achieve greater sensitivity than Chorus/Nomad, and
that it was important to do so.  They were approved as a Main
Injector experiment, but the PAC was "intrigued" at the idea of
starting E--803 in the Proton West area using 150 GeV Main Ring
protons before the Main Injector is completed.   An Indiana
group has joined E--803.

</h1><h1>Beam Cost estimate@
The Facilities Engineering Services Section, in an effort that
was coordinated by Byron Lundberg,  completed Revision 0
of their Project Definition Report (PDR) for the NuMI Project.
The cost estimate for the neutrino beam aimed at Soudan was
$45.7M, including overhead and Profit(OHP), Engineering, Design
and Administration (EDIA), and Contingency.  Escalation was not
included.  $11M of costs were identified for excavation.

</h1><h1>Beam Cost estimate again@
Part of cost can be associated with the fact that the dolomite
includes a 10 meter section of highly fractured rock.  This was
found by the drilling both at the dump and the experimental
hall.  A revised cost PDR (Revision 1) will attempt to keep
the beamline shallower and reduce some costs.

</h1><h1>ICARUS LONG BASELINE PROPOSAL@
The new ICARUS proposal (22 September 1993) includes 20 pages on
the atmospheric neutrinos, and 24 pages on their long baseline
proposal from CERN.   The LHC Transfer tunnel points within 3
degrees of Gran Sasso.  They propose a 1000 meter decay pipe.
They could run from 40 GeV to 450 GeV, with the highest energy
preferred for numu to nutau searches.  For this mode they have
three tests, which they call "disappearance method" (our
near/far), their "appearance method" (our nc/cc), and their
"direct appearance" which involves identifying individual taus.
This latter method is only under study and will depend on the
chosen wire pitch for sufficient precision.  They also discuss
numu to nue searches and matter effects in some detail.

</h1><h1>822 seeks new collaborators@
The 822 collaboration needs to be strengthened, and we know that
we need to seek out groups that may be looking for future
projects in light of the SSC fiasco.   Internal discussions on
the best way to find potential new collaborators are going on
within the collaboration.

</h1><h1>Argonne receives LDRD funds, Rutherford-PPESP funds@
A proposal to increase staff to work on the Long Baseline
proposal was funded for 1993-94.  This discretionary funding is
provided by the office of Frank Fradin, Associate Lab Director
for Physical Research.  Possibilities for the use of the money
include a new postdoc or a visiting scientist position at ANL.
The UK part of the Soudan collaboration also received approval
from PPESP for the funding of module refurbishing.
