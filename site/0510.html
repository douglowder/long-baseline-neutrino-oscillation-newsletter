*** Theta-13 sensitivity for new experiments
</h1>
The APS neutrino study recommended reactor and accelerator 
experiments sensitive to sin^2 2 theta > 0.01.  This is sometimes 
viewed as a precise recommendation.  Unfortunately, the sensitivity 
of a proposed experiment is not so precise.  One obvious 
uncertainty for both reactor and accelerator experiments is the 
variation with delta-msquared_32, which has a fairly wide range of 
allowed values.  Should a proposed experiment calculate its 
sensitivity for the current best fit or for the worst value?  For 
accelerator experiments, there are well known degeneracies and 
ambiguities due to uncertainties in theta_23, delta and the mass 
hierarchy.  Should experiments show sensitivity for a typical, 
average or worst values of parameters?  Whichever choices are 
employed, they should be clearly labeled.  More important, when 
proposals are compared, these issues need to be understood.

*** Varying delta near oscillation max - T2K
</h1>
T2K often shows its theta_13 sensitivity with an analysis using CP 
delta=0.  Delta is unknown.  This sensitivity is sin^2 2-theta < 
0.008 for a 5 year run (for dmsq = 2.5 10^-3 eV^2).  To reach the 
same sensitivity if delta = pi/2 would take only 2.5 years.  But if 
delta = -pi/2, it would take 50 years.  See Figure 5 in 
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0505202"> hep-ph/0505202.</a>

*** Super-Kamiokande draining its tank again
</h1>
Super-K is draining the tank to return to the full coverage they 
had before the December 2001 accident.  They'll be done by spring.

*** Bahcall Tribute in Princeton
</h1>
Among the themes voiced by several speakers at the IAP Bahcall 
Tribute were John's great and multifaceted impact on science, 
through his research, his mentoring of young people, his 
leadership, and his making things happen.  Also very notable 
among them were the total scientific honesty, courage, care, and 
perseverance that led John to stick to his guns over several
decades of a solar neutrino "problem" whose solution, in the end, 
proved that John's prediction of the solar neutrino flux had been 
right all along. John's not tweaking the theory to agree with the 
data {and the relative stability, after initial variations, of the 
Homestake result} resulted in the persistence of a discrepancy 
that led to a deep insight into the nature of neutrinos.

*** Mothballing HERON
</h1>
HERON was an R & D project to develop a low E solar nu detector.
It is cryogenic, making use of superfluid helium as the detection 
medium and novel applications of micro-calorimeters.  But with 
many other neutrino opportunities, testing the solar model with 
neutrinos is a tough sell.  HERON has decided not to pursue a 
prototype, to wrap up present experiments and to mothball the 
project.  They produced 20 publications and 7 Ph.D. theses.

A decadal survey of particle physics is being conducted under the 
auspices of the National Academy of Sciences.  They have held 
public meetings and the final report is due 12/2005.  It is 
likely that they will strongly endorse a linear collider, but 
I've heard several people express concerns that there will be 
language about priorities that will damage possibilities for 
many promising nu projects. Send comments to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3451444406040504745a55471a515041">[email&#160;protected]</a>.

*** Homestake LOI solicitation
</h1>
The South Dakota Science and Technology Authority (SDSTA) has made 
an agreement with Barrick Gold Corporation to transfer the 
Homestake Mine to the SDSTA.  A total of $45.6M  is available for 
the development and operation of the Homestake Underground Lab.
SDSTA plans to open the 4850 ft level and some higher levels for 
beneficial occupancy in early 2007 for scientific and engineering
experiments. The funds will cover rehabilitation and basic lab
operations into 2012.  The SDSTA is now soliciting Letters of 
Interest.  See

*** MiniBooNE results
</h1>
No open box yet, but they showed other results at PANIC:

48% of data is Charged Current Quasielastic.  The energy plot
matches expectation, but the angular plot has an interesting 
mystery at cos-theta ~ 1.  31% of data are CC pi+ events, the 
world's largest sample.  Michel decay time & energy distributions 
again match, and there is the same angular discrepancy.  Cross 
section ratios are being compared with Nuance, Nuegen, ... It'd be 
nice to have data like this for antineutrinos!  "Prospects for 
Antineutrino Running at MiniBooNE" by Wascko is in

*** SNO plus
</h1>

SNO is currently running its heavy water detector with Helium 
counters.  It will end 31 Dec 06, and return the heavy water to 
Atomic Energy of Canada.  A large component of their operating cost 
is deuterium insurance.  They now have a plan to fill SNO with 
scintillator for low energy solar neutrinos, and a long-baseline 
reactor neutrino search.  They also have capabilities for 
geoneutrinos and could separate U and Th since the reactor neutrino 
"background" is lower than KamLAND.  A TDR contemplated by fall 06.
