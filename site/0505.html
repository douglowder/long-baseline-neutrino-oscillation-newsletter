*** Neutrino Assessment
</h1>
The Neutrino Scientific Assessment Group met in the DC area and
considered 5 neutrinoless double beta decay experiments, 3
reactor neutrino experiments, and 2 accelerator programs.  The
next meeting is July 17.  A first report is now expected in late
July, with an opinion on 0nu betabeta experiments first.

*** Should the Tevatron turn off to run NOvA sooner?
</h1>
The P5 advisory committee for DOE-HEP has a charge to study the
remaining programs at Fermilab's Tevatron and SLAC's B factory,
which are scheduled to cease operations in 2009.  An earlier
start to a Fermilab off-axis experiment was one example of what
might be done if something turned off any earlier during a
presentation by Robin Staffin at Fermilab.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Deep Neutrinos
</h1>
There were 8 proposals for the DUSEL lab, and some winnowing is
going on, with depth being one of the issues.  So far, Mark Felt
denies that he is the source of any neutrinos.

<p> </p><h1>
*** MINERvA project
</h1>
MINERvA is now a project at FNAL with Debbie Harris as Project
Manager and Nancy Grossman and Ron Ransome (Rutgers) as Deputies.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Cuorcino result
</h1>
The Cuorcino experiment has set a new limit on the neutrinoless
betabeta decay of 130Te of 1.8 10^24 years.  With uncertainties
from matrix elements, this implies an upper bound on the
effective neutrino mass .2-1.1 eV.  This is comparable to the
sensitivity of Ge experiments.  Reminder a claim for a signal at
0.4 eV exists.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Cuore search for neutrino mass
</h1>
This is a proposal for a 0nu betabeta experiment searching for
130Te to 130Xe using .78 ton of TeO2.  It will be bolometric,
using the source as the absorber, and run at 10 milliKelvin.   It
has been approved by the LNGS policy committee, and US interest
includes Livermore, LBL, Berkeley and South Caroline.

<p> </p><h1>
*** EXO search for neutrino mass
</h1>
EXO is a fully funded 200 kg enriched Xenon experiment to search
for the neutrinoless double beta decay of Xe136.  There is also a
research program to study the possibility of Barium tagging, which
would make this a virtually background free search.  It will
operate at WIPP.  A one ton detector in 5 years could be sensitive
to 50-68 meV and a 10 tons to 11-15 meV.  US groups include SLAC,
Stanford, Alabama, Colorado State, UC Irvine and Cal Tech.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Majorana search for Neutrino Mass
</h1>
The proposal is for 180 kg of Ge76 and to keep backgrounds at or
below 1 event per ton-year in the energy region of interest.  US
groups include Brown, LBL, LLNL, LANL, New Mexico State, Oak
Ridge, Pacific Northwest, TUNL, Chicago, South Carolina,
Tennessee and Washington.  The planned Major procurement total is
$21.7M with a $38.7M Total estimated cost.  Majorana has signed a
cooperative agreement with GERDA to share expertise.

<p> </p><h1>
*** MOON search for neutrino mass
</h1>
4 experiments can be done using 100Mo, a search for solar nus and
0nu betabeta decay.  This group, which includes Washington, is
asking for no money and a proposal would be prepared around 2007.

<p> </p><h1>
*** NeMO 3 and SuperNEMO search for neutrino mass
</h1>
NeMO 3 has been running since February 2003 at Frejus.  They have
7 sources in foils imbedded in wire chambers,  Two of them Mo and
Se are 0nu betabeta searches, with limits set so far at 4.6 10^23
years and 1.0 10^23 years corresponding to neutrino mass limits
.66-2.81 eV and 1.75-4.86 eV.  SuperNEMO would use 100 kg of Se.
Mount Holyoke, Texas and Idaho Falls are interested US groups.

<p> </p><h1>
*** NuFACT05 21-26 June in Frascati Rome
</h1>
<a href="http://www.lnf.infn.it/conference/2005/nufact05/">
http://www.lnf.infn.it/conference/2005/nufact05/
</a>
The 7th International Workshop on Neutrino Factories and
Superbeams will be at Frascati.  The proposal of a 1 year
International preparatory "Scoping Study" of a new and superior
neutrino accelerator complex, in preparation for a complete
Design Study, will be presented and discussed.

*** Can you see solar neutrinos during an eclipse?
</h1>
Ishikawa &amp; Shimomura consider how the solar neutrino flux might
be affected when the moon gets in the way in
