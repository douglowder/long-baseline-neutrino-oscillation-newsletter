*** Evidence that Neutrinos are Majorana particles
</h1>
H.V. Klapdor-Kleingrothaus et al., Mod Phys Lett A 16 (2002) 
2409-2420, present "Evidence for Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay". 
A 3.1 sigma peak is found which fits to a best value of the 
neutrino mass of 0.39 eV and a half life 1.5 10^25 years.  See
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0201231"> hep-ph/0201231 </a>
and an analysis in 
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0201226"> hep-ph/0201226.  </a>
Prior data 
analysis is in 
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0103062"> hep-ph/0103062.  </a>
They're using 125 moles of Ge76.

*** NuFact02 Summer School - Error correction
</h1>
A Summer School to introduce young researchers to both the 
particle and accelerator physics aspects of Neutrino Factories 
will take place 24 -29 June 02 in Abingdon UK.  The NuFact02 
Workshop will be 1-6 July, at Imperial College.  The date in last 
month's newsletter was wrong.  Find links on next news item.

*** Neutrino Beams meeting at CERN; Other meetings
</h1>
A Nu Beams and Instrumentation Workshop is 14-19 March at CERN.
This is 1 of 19 meetings in 2002 that are listed on the meetings 
page.  
<a href="http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/numeetings.html"> 
http://www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/numeetings.html. </a>
The Aspen underground workshop 5/27-6/23 will cover solar and 
supernova nus week 2, atmospheric, long-baseline experiments and
betabeta decay week 3.  There is limited space so apply ASAP.   

<p> <h1>
*** Mini-BooNE gets ready to run
</h1>
The Mini-BooNE tank is being filled with oil (45K gallons as of 
mid-January) and will be completely full by the Ides of March. 
The detector should be ready to run by April Fool's Day, while 
first beam is scheduled for around Memorial Day. A problem with 
the oil attenuation length turned out to be just bubbles, and 
went away after everyone's New Year's Eve parties were over
(attenuation length improving to about 25 meters.)  If the LSND 
signal is right, they'll get a >5 sigma effect in 1-2 years.

<p> <h1>
*** Super-K phototube studies; quick restart
</h1>
Super-K showed a video of a tube breaking test at the HEPAP 
meeting.  They broke 4 tubes on purpose near the bottom of their 
tank.  The video showed the problem (a chain reaction) and one 
solution (1 cm acrylic bubbles).  They plan to empty this month, 
redeploy tubes at 50% the previous coverage, and start filling 
again this fall. K2K will run again early next year.

<p> <h1>
*** JHF2K progress towards proposal
</h1>
A study group has decided that the proposed neutrino beam from 
JHF-Jaeri to Super-K/Hyper-K should focus on the off-axis beam 
for a 5 year run from the JHF.  They also have increased the 
decay pipe length from 80m to 130m for a 40% increase in the peak 
flux.  The width of the decay pipe will accommodate +- 0.5 degree 
angle in the off-axis-beam.  The front detector at 2 km reduces 
the far/near systematics.    

<p> <h1>
*** A call to form the JHF2K Collaboration.
</h1>
This will take place at a meeting at Kyoto University on March 9.

*** Which Bora is the site for Hyper-Kamiokande
</h1>
It's not the island Bora-Bora, or the caves at Tora-Bora.  Ten kilometers 
south of the Kamiokande in the Mozumi mine, is the Tochibora mine, 
a possible site for Hyper-Kamiokande, where the rock is better.
An off-axis beam from JHF could aim below both of them, and be 
1.5 degrees off-axis both sites.  The beam would come up in Korea.

<p> <h1>
*** Which Bohr is the star?
</h1>
The play 
<a href="http://courttheater.uchicago.edu/features/copenhagen.html"> 
Copenhagen </a>
has three characters, Niels Bohr, Margrethe Bohr, 
and, within the limits of certainty, Werner Heisenberg.

<p> <h1>
*** Which Boring Machine isn't at NuMI anymore?
</h1>
The tunnel Boring Machine finished its NuMI work December 8.
Civil Construction scheduled end is August 2002.  Installation of 
decay pipe scheduled to start late February.

<p> <h1>
*** SPL
</h1>
At CERN, there is an idea to use the RF from LEP for a 
superconducting proton linac (SPL).  The SPL could be used to run 
both a superbeam (numu) and betabeam(nu_e) together.  The SPL 
itself could be staged, with a test of 3MeV H- injector first, 
then a 120 MeV H- linac in the PS South Hall.  A design report 
with a cost estimate for the linac will be done in 2003.

<p> <h1>
*** UNO in Frejus?
</h1>
A safety tunnel will be constructed at Frejus parallel to 
the highway.  This provides an opportunity for a large detector 
130 km from CERN (part of the motivation for NNN02-transparencies 
at <a href="http://muonstoragerings.cern.ch/NuWorkshop02/agenda.html"> 
http://muonstoragerings.cern.ch/NuWorkshop02/agenda.html) </a>

<p> <h1>
*** Beta Beams
</h1>
If you produce a radioactive ion with a short beta-decay 
lifetime, and accelerate it in the PS to high energy, and store 
the ion in a storage ring, then nu_e will be produced with single 
flavor, known spectrum and intensity.  NE-18 and HE-6 considered, 
15-30K neutrino events ~3/4 GeV at 130 km from CERN in UNO.
