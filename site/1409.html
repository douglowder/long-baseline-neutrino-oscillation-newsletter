*** First meeting of LBNF interim International Executive Board
</H1> <P>
The 2014 HEPAP P5 sub panel has recommended that the US form a new
fully international collaboration to design and execute a highly
capable Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF).  To guide this
process an interim International Executive Board has been formed,
and it met for the first time at Fermilab on  September 23-24.
The presentations from this meeting are available at
<A href="https://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=8937">
https://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=8937.  </A> The
meeting concluded with broad agreement on the science goals of the
project as well as the configuration using a broad band intense
neutrino beam and a high granularity liquid argon time projection
chamber as the far detector.  Within the next month, the board
will draft an LOI describing the experimental parameters and the
initial collaboration membership.  Next meeting 20 October.

*** ArgoNeuT measures coherent neutrino pion production in Ar
</H1> <P>
ArgoNeuT has measured coherent pion production from Argon for the
first time, 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0598"> arXiv:1408.0598 </A>.
  Theoretically, "coherent" applies
only when the target nucleus is in its ground state after the
interaction.   They identify events with just a muon and pion
observed.  A lively discussion has ensued in <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="016f742c7972646241706c746d2f60622f746a">[email&#160;protected]</a>
about the interpretation of the result, which agrees with the
Rein-Sehgal model.  MINERvA paper in

*** Connie CCDs for coherent neutrino elastic scattering
</H1> <P>
Four CCDs arrived in Brazil and will be installed this month by
the CONNIE collaboration in a box 30 meters from the ANGRA 2
reactor.  Then polyethylene and lead shielding will be installed
later this year.  They expect 0.3 events/day in each 10g CCD.
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5761"> arXiv:1405.5761. </A>
describes the CCDs, used previously in a Dark
Matter search, which could measure the nuclear recoils.

*** The COHERENT collaboration at the Oak Ridge SNS
</H1> <P>
A newly formed collaboration called COHERENT proposes to measure
nu-nucleus coherent elastic scattering (NES) using neutrinos from
stopped pions created by neutrons at the Spallation Neutron
Source.  The goal is to unambiguously measure the N^2 dependence.

<H1>
*** What do coherent pion production and NES have in common?
</H1> <P>
The two previously mentioned processes are both called
"coherent" but it is not clear to me if the physics is related
or not.  I have heard one is coherent in "s" and the other in "t"?

<H1>
*** Decoherence of neutrino oscillations
</H1> <P>
Nus are produced in flavor eigenstates and propagate in mass
eigenstates with different velocities.  If the wave packets get
far enough apart, they decohere and we get mixing without
oscillations.  As far as I know, only supernova neutrinos are 
far enough away to decohere from measured sources of nus.

<H1>
*** Coherent program of Short- and Long-Baseline Neutrinos
</H1> <P>
The P5 report called for a coherent program of long-baseline and
short-baseline neutrino physics at Fermilab.   I have been asked
what you can do in short-baseline experiments that you cannot do
in a near detector of a long-baseline experiment.  The physics
goals are different.  The LBL program is trying to measure
parameters within the three neutrino paradigm.  The SBL is looking
for new physics outside that paradigm largely motivated by certain
anomalies.  But also, the short-baseline program would like to
get going with existing beams, should put detectors at more than
one baseline, and sites on the surface are cheaper than deep
locations in the NuMI or new LBNF beams.  There will be synergies,
of course, in the development of liquid Argon technology.

<H1>
*** Short-Baseline Neutrino Experiment Workshop at CERN
</H1> <P>
A Meeting to discuss various aspects of short-baseline neutrino
experiments was held at CERN.  Transparencies are available at
<A href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/335564/other-view?view=standard.">

*** NOvA achieves CD4; celebrate with a baseline talk
</H1> <P>
On Wednesday 8 October FNAL will have an all-hands celebration
of the NOvA successful construction completion.  Now operating
in the Fermilab NuMI beam is a far detector at Ash River
Minnesota and a near detector at Fermilab.  Both detectors are
off-axis from the direction of the NuMI beam which was built
for MINOS and is now running for Minerva and MINOS+.  At 9AM on
the 8th there will be a seminar on "Baselines and Nu Oscillations"
by Mary Bishai in WH10NW, addressing baseline's role in CP & MH.
The NOvA celebration starts at 10 in Ramsey Auditorium and a
buffet dinner with beer/wine and jazz is 4:30-6:00 in atrium.

*** NSAC Town meeting on Fundamental Symmetries, Neutrinos, ...
</H1> <P>
This meeting was in Chicago 28-29 Sep.  A number of white papers
on ideas for the world neutrino program are available:

*** MiniBooNE shuts down

Originally scheduled to end in 2005, MiniBooNE had a closing
ceremony on 18 Sep.

The next meeting on Next generation Nucleon Decay and Nu Detectors
will be at APC-Lab, Paris-Diderot Campus
