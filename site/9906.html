*** K2K;  First long-baseline (accelerator) event reported
</h1>This is the 88th monthly issue of long-baseline news, but the
first for which an accelerator based long-baseline neutrino
experiment actually has data.  At Super-Kamiokande on
June 19th, run 7436 event 1405412 a muon neutrino during a
beam spill pointed back to the KEK accelerator.

*** SNO - Sudbury's Now Operating
</h1>The Sudbury heavy water solar neutrino experiment has started
taking data.  Beautiful atmospheric neutrino candidates and solar
neutrino candidates have been seen.  Noise due to radioactivity
is below expectation at this point.  A problem they had with high
voltage breakdown in a connector has been completely solved by
regassifying the water with pure Nitrogen.  It had been
degassified to remove Oxygen.

*** Long-Baseline Plans in Europe - 1
</h1>A New York Times article described the Fermilab to Soudan project
as being developed in Europe.  There is some truth to this.
There are three times as many European countries in the MINOS
collaboration as North American countries.    The British
contingent of the experiment have recently appeared with a money
and effort request in front of the PPESP.  The requests will be
forwarded to PPARC with formal approval expected in December.

*** Long-Baseline Plans in Europe - 2
</h1>Another European plan for long-baseline neutrino experiments is
the NGS initiative, Neutrinos to Gran Sasso (from CERN).  An
NGS addendum has been issued (R. Bailey et al., report
INFN-AE-99-05 and CERN-SL-99-034-DI).  There is also a new web
page with NGS information
<a href="http://www.cern.ch/NGS">
http://www.cern.ch/NGS.  </a> As always,
such web pages are available at the Neutrino Oscillation Industry
site,
<a href="http://www.hep.anl.gov/NDK/Hypertext/nu_industry.html">
www.hep.anl.gov/NDK/Hypertext/nu_industry.html </a>
Proposals are due in October and a decision is seen by December.
European long-baseline proposals include ICARUS, DAEDALUS, OPERA,
AQUA-RICH, NOE and MONOLITH.

*** Atmospheric Sterile Neutrino "almost" ruled out
</h1>Since sterile neutrinos have no neutral current interaction,
there is a difference in cross section between sterile and active
neutrinos in the earth.  This leads to an MSW like effect for
sterile neutrinos.  This effect is largest near the best fit
parameters of Super-K for atmospheric neutrinos.  It would
distort the angular distribution of upward throughgoing muons and
partially contained events.  The ratio of vertical to horizontal
events in these two categories disfavors sterile neutrinos at the
2+ sigma level.   Great fits to all distributions can be obtained
with if numu is oscillating to nutau.

*** Alice's Restaurant for solar neutrinos in Super-K
</h1>"You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant" or by
analyzing Super-K solar nu data.  There is now a 2 sigma effect
for a day-night effect.   From 825 days, D-N/D+N = -0.065 +-
0.031(stat) +- 0.013(syst).  If real, it would be the Large Angle
MSW solution.  But then there wouldn't be a spectral distortion.
Chi-squared for flat is 24.3 (18-1 d.o.f.)  The shape is a fit
for vacuum oscillations, but a change in the hep neutrino flux
together with small-angle MSW also works.  Finally, there is a
hint for some seasonal variation, beyond what would be expected
from the eccentricity of the earth's orbit.

*** Pontecorvo on Solar Neutrinos
</h1>Writing on April 6, 1972, he wrote "It would be nice if all this
will end with something unexpected from the point of view of
particle physics.  Unfortunately, it will not be  easy to
demonstrate this even if nature works that way."

<p> </p><h1>
*** Quark/Lepton Symmetry
</h1>Wolfenstein recently pointed out that Quark/Lepton symmetry is one
reason for neutrino mass, but the symmetry is broken.
"If you can't tell the difference between a quark and a lepton,
you're in pretty bad shape."
Ramond, "or a string theorist."
Wolfenstein, "same thing."
