*** LBNF open meetings 5 Dec at CERN and 12 Dec at FNAL
</h1> <p>
The move to form a new international collaboration for a long-
baseline experiment hosted by Fermilab will continue with two
open meetings in early December.  They're "PI meetings", presumably
with a loose definition of principle investigator.  The iIEB web

*** Result favors the normal hierarchy
</h1> <p>
The sum of the neutrino masses with the cosmological analysis
in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.7244"> arXiv:1410.7244 </a>
is &lt; 140 meV at 95% CL.  We would expect
~ 60 meV in the hierarchical normal hierarchy, and 110 inverted.
In this paper Palanque-Delabrouille et al. combine the Lyman
alpha forest power spectrum from BOSS with Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) Data and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data.

Actually,
Francis Halzen wins Smithsonian Ingenuity Award.  "See how one
physicist's pursuit of the cosmos took off in Antarctica.  (His)
amazing experiment heralds the beginning of new era in astronomy."

*** MINERvA measures Quasielastic Interactions from the p side
</h1> <p>
Most Quasi-elastic measurements rely on the final state lepton
kinematics to reconstruct an estimate of both the neutrino energy
and momentum transferred to the nucleus (Q2).  Now for the first
time MINERvA has isolated a sample of quasi-elastic-like events
where Q2 is reconstructed only by final state proton kinematics &amp;
the fact that a muon was also tagged in the interaction but no
detected pions.  This measurement provides a new probe of the
final state interactions.  Comparisons with models show that the
model that best matches the proton kinematics are not the same as
the one that best predicts the muon kinematics.

*** MINERvA measures Coherent pion production
</h1> <p>
Previously, K2K &amp; SciBooNE didn't observe coherent pi+ production
at the level predicted by Rein-Sehgal as then implemented in NEUT
and NUANCE.  By selecting events with low momentum transferred to
the nucleus, (a model-independent signature of coherent
interactions), MINERvA finds 1628 (770) coherent candidates in its
nu (antinu) datasets.  They find that the predicted coherent pion
kinematics from neutrino event generators currently used do not
agree with the measured distributions, particularly for pions at
large angles with respect to the neutrino beam.

*** MINERvA measures single pion production
</h1> <p>
MINERvA has reported the cross section for single pion production
on a hydrocarbon target at 4.0 GeV for numu interactions.  Events
with low W are chosen to enhance single pi production mostly from
the Delta (1232).  A comparison of the data to models shows the
importance of including pion intranuclear rescattering.  The cross
section as a function of pi angle has a similar shape as MiniBooNE
at lower neutrino energy, heightening the disagreement with theory
seen previously.

*** Decoherence of neutrino oscillations 2
</h1> <p>
Last month I wrote, "As far as I know, only supernova neutrinos
are far enough away to decohere from measured sources of nus.  Now
I know better.  pp neutrinos decohere already inside the Sun (at
the distance about 200 km from production).  Boron neutrinos (due
to higher energies) decohere at few solar radii.

*** A coherent answer to a coherency question
</h1> <p>
To my question on the similarity/difference between Coherent Pion
Production (CPP) and Coherent Nu elastic scattering (NES), the
biggest difference is that in CPP, coherency is due to the
[(virtual meson)+(nucleus)--&gt;(physical pion production)+(nucleus)]
interaction, and hence is a strong interaction effect and varies
as A**2.  In NES, the coherency is due to the [virtual Z + nucleus
--&gt;(nucleus]] interaction, and hence is a weak interaction effect
varying as [Z(1 - 4*sin^2(theta-W)) - N ]^2, approximating to N^2.

*** RENO-50 funding
</h1> <p>
The RENO-50 project will receive an R&amp;D funding of US 2M $
from the Samsung Science &amp; Technology Foundation, in next
three years. The R&amp;D will include a feasibility study to achieve
3% energy resolution at 1 MeV, essential for determining the
neutrino mass hierarchy using reactor neutrinos. During the
R&amp;D period, a full funding of RENO-50 will be pursued."

*** CERN SPC welcomes test beam effort and NA61 for LBNF
</h1> <p>
Thomas Kutter and Greg Pawloski presented EOI011, for a detector-
engineering test and test beam calibration of a 1-phase LAr TPC.
They supported the project and recognized its potential to foster
cooperation &amp; further develop synergies within a future worldwide
long-baseline LBNF collaboration.  The encouraged a technical
proposal that included the synergy with WA105.  The also received
a proposal for hadron production measurements for FNAL using NA61.
They considered the physics case important &amp; recommended approval.
