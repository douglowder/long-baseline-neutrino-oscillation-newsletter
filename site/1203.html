*** Daya Bay measures theta_13
</H1> <P>

<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1669"> arXiv:1203.1669 </a> 
Using six reactors and six detectors, the Daya Bay 
reactor neutrino collaboration reported a 5.2 sigma measurement of 
electron antineutrino disappearance.  With  43,000 GW-ton-days, 
they see 80376 neutrinos at their near detectors; they also see 
10416 events in their far detector which is 0.940+-0.011+-0.004 of 
the rate expected if theta13=0.  Their best fit is sin^2(2-q13) = 
0.092+-0.016(stat)+-0.005(syst) in a 3 nu framework.  This is with 
rate only; they will have 2 more detectors, and more exposure.

<H1>
*** Magic number for theta_13?
</H1> <P>
In China the word for "eight" (Cantonese "fa", Mandarin "ba")
sounds like the word for prosper or wealth.  Superstitious people 
take this seriously, e.g. the license plate number  888888 sells 
for millions.  The Daya Bay result for theta_13 in degrees is 8.8 
+- 0.8.

*** RENO measures theta_13
</H1> <P>
Reno detects antineutrinos from 6 reactors at 2 locations, 294 m &
1383 m.  In a 229 day run, the they see 17102 events in the far 
detector and 154088 in the near detector, or .922+-0.010+-0.008 of 
the expected rate for theta_13=0.  The best fit is sin^2(2q13) = 
0.103+-0.013+-0.011 from rate only.  Submitted to PRL

<H1>
*** Top 9 consequences of the new measurements of theta_13
</H1> <P>
1.)  Future long-baseline experiments need to redo all of their
sensitivity plots; 2.) They need to switch from log theta13 to
linear in theta13; 3.) They need to go above 0.1 if they didn't
before; 4) Nobody needs to add tribimaximal to their spell checker 
anymore; 5) Muon fed neutrino factories need a new reason to exist
6) People should stop calling theta_13 the last unmeasured nu 
mixing angle; soon it will be the best measured angle.  7) We need 
to think of a way to define the mass hierarchy as an angle.  8) It 
is too late for a theorist to "predict" theta_13.  9) Global 
fitters need to get back to work on mass hierarchy and delta.  

<H1>
*** Neutrino angle predictions
</H1> <P>
In Carl Albright's table of theta_13 predictions in arXiv:0905.0146,
there was an 
excess just under the previous limit.  Cynics abound, but this 
time the predictions were right!  One simple prediction was the 
Cabbibo angle/sqrt(2).

*** Neutrino velocity story continues
</H1> <P>
After the loose cable in OPERA was found, physicists around the
world told each other "I told you so."  I'll admit to being wrong,
since I guessed the biggest issue was in the accelerator physics 
and not the timing.  Meanwhile, efforts to remeasure the velocity
continue on both sides of the Atlantic.  MINOS has started taking 
data in early March with new more accurate clocks.  OPERA/Borexino 
resume data taking in April 12. ICARUS finds c=c,

*** LBNE "decision" is no as-is; but a version of LBNE will emerge
</H1> <P>
After testifying before congress and telling us that LBNE was too
expensive, 
<A href="http://www.aip.org/fyi/2012/043.html">
http://www.aip.org/fyi/2012/043.html </a> Office of Science 
Director Brinkman sent a letter to Fermilab Director Oddone:  "...
we cannot support the LBNE project as it is currently configured.
This decision is not a negative judgment about the importance of
the science, but rather it is a recognition that the peak cost of
the project cannot be accommodated in the current budget climate
or that projected for the next decade."  He asked for a phased
approach and consideration of alternative configurations to LBNE.

<H1>
*** Fermilab Steering Committee to meet 25 & 26 April
</H1> <P>
A new committee will look at a phased approach and consider
alternative configurations to LBNE.  On 25 April, possible new
ideas for using the NuMI beam will be considered, while on 26 
April, ways to split the current LBNE (far detector at Homestake,
near detector, beam) will be considered.  I've heard that the
sessions which are at Fermilab will be open.

<H1>
*** LBNE holds director's review
</H1> <P>
Even after the Brinkman letter, the LBNE project presented its
review of the project as-is, to the Fermilab Director, in advance
of a CD1 review.  By understanding the costs in detail, it can
help to develop reasonable staging options.

<H1>
*** NuTURN Gran Sasso 8-10 May, 
<A href="http://nuturn2012.lngs.infn.it/"> 
http://nuturn2012.lngs.infn.it/ </a>
</H1> <P>
With the large theta_13 from Daya Bay and others, we have an 
opportunity to study the leptonic mixing matrix, addressing the 
major challenges in this field.  The NuTURN2012 workshop will 
evaluate the "large" theta_13 scenario. It will target the 
opportunities offered by the existing and new facilities, and in 
particular, by the long-baseline experiments. A principal aim is 
to clarify which type of neutrino beams, detectors and which 
laboratories are best suited to investigate the neutrino 
properties, in order to outline a realistic European roadmap.

<H1>
*** MicroBoonE gets CD3B
</H1> <P>
This short-baseline liquid argon experiment will resolve if
the MiniBooNE low energy excess is electrons or photons.  It
is also a step along the way to larger liquid argon detectors.
