<H1>Long-Baseline news, March 2023 </H1>
<P>

*** Updated neutrino parameters from T2K
</H1> <P>
T2K has new measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters in
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03222"> arXiv:2303.03222 </A>
using 19.7(16.3)e20 POT using (anti-)neutrinos
at the far detector, 4.7 e20 more POT than previously.  dmsq_32
is 2.494 +0.041 -0.058 e-3 eV^2.  delta_CP = -1.97+0.09-0.70.
Zero and pi are excluded at more than 90% CL.

<H1>
*** SNO+ measures reactor antineutrinos
</H1> <P>
With 190 days of data, they found a 3-sigma signal for antinus
coming from nuclear reactors at least 240 km away with a water
detector.

*** Neutrino radiological diagnostics
</H1> <P>
If you are a neutrino physicist and you are invited to submit an
article on nu radiotherapy, you share it with your colleagues,
perhaps on NuSTEC news, 
<A href="https://nustec.fnal.gov/nustec-news/">
https://nustec.fnal.gov/nustec-news/.  
</A>
It
might be to see if any have a good idea for using neutrinos in
medical diagnostics, or it may be just to get them to smile.

*** WIN 2023 and NuFACT 2023 to be in Asia this summer
</H1> <P>

The 29th International
Workshop on Weak Interactions and Neutrinos (WIN2023) will be
3-8 July at Sun Yatsen University (SYSU) in Zhuhai, China.  It
will be exclusively an in-person meeting.
<A href="http://nufact2023.snu.ac.kr">
http://nufact2023.snu.ac.kr.
</A>
Then the 24th International workshop
on Neutrinos from Accelerators (NuFACT 2023) will be 21-26 August
at Seoul National University in Korea.  The workshop has 7 working
groups on muon, neutrino and accelerator physics and detectors.

<H1>
*** Petcov fest 24 April and online
</H1> <P>
PetcovFEST, a (belated) celebration of Serguey Petcov's 70th
anniversary, will be held on 24 April 2023 at ICTP in Trieste,
Italy, as well as over Zoom.

*** Another article in Science Magazine critical of Fermilab
</H1> <P>
Using nouns such as turmoil, frustrations, and weakness, it ties
DUNE to the decision to bid Fermilab's management contract.  It
mentions that gaining access to the lab site has become an ordeal,
which makes it a difficult place to do science.

*** Christopher Walter wins John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship
</H1> <P>
As announced by the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation in the 9 Apr.
New York Times, Duke neutrino physicist Chris Walter has been
awarded a Fellowship "under the freest possible conditions".

*** Moore's law and Maury's law
</H1> <P>
On the passing of Intel co-founder, it is worth mentioning that
particle physics has been one of many beneficiaries of Moore's
law, i.e. that the number of components in ICs would double every
year or two.  A practical benefit is that computers have steadily
gotten faster for decades.  But I have proposed a corollary: that
"no matter how fast computers get, we spend the same fraction of
our time waiting for them."

*** Avoiding publication goofs with 1000 authors
</H1> <P>
The president of Stanford is involved in a controversy because a
highly cited 4-author publication apparently had falsified images.
(See 
<A href="https://stanforddaily.com/2023/02/17/internal-review-found-falsified-data-in-stanford-presidents-alzheimers-research-colleagues-allege/ ">
https://stanforddaily.com/2023/02/17/internal-review-found-falsified-data-in-stanford-presidents-alzheimers-research-colleagues-allege/ 
</A>
A list of articles about this story can be found at
<A href="https://stanforddaily.com/2023/02/16/latest-updates-stanford-president-under-investigation-for-research-misconduct/">
https://stanforddaily.com/2023/02/16/latest-updates-stanford-president-under-investigation-for-research-misconduct/
</A>
The images are in the 6 March article:
<A href="https://stanforddaily.com/2023/03/06/mtl-knew-misconduct-allegations-independently-corroborated-in-private-correspondence-to-special-committee/">
https://stanforddaily.com/2023/03/06/mtl-knew-misconduct-allegations-independently-corroborated-in-private-correspondence-to-special-committee/
</A>)
Large particle physics experiments have extensive paper review
procedures.  And eventually, reproducibility demands help us
converge on the truth, as happened in this case.  But still, we
neutrino physicists trust a large number of other people, against
both unintentional mistakes and fraud.  At least we don't have
non-disclosure agreements that I'm aware of.
