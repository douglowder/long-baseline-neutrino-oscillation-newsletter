*** Neutrinos at the June 2015 Fermilab PAC
</H1> <P>
Fermilab PAC presentations continue to be dominated by nu physics
experiments & issues.  During a planning exercise it was said that
in 10 years, FNAL will be to neutrinos what CERN is to the Higgs.
The lab specified four goals for the next 5 years:
<br>* Support detector R&D and new initiatives in neutrino science
<br>* Build the short-baseline neutrino program
<br>* Deliver the world's highest power beams for neutrino science
<br>* Partner internationally to host a world-leading long-baseline
neutrino program.

*** Matt Toups gets 2015 Tollestrup Award
</H1> <P>
The award is made each year for outstanding work in collaboration
with Fermilab scientists. Toups received this year's award for his
contributions to the liquid-argon-based short-baseline neutrino
program at Fermilab, including MicroBooNE and the Short-Baseline
Near Detector.  Two main contributions were to co-lead the
commissioning of MicroBooNE and developing the UV light system.

*** Mission Need for PIP II
</H1> <P>
The Proton Improvement plan II will provide 1.2 MW of power to the
DUNE neutrino science program being developed at Fermilab.  A
review was held in June to provide support for the Mission Need
Statement to be developed by the Office of High Energy Physics in
the DOE.

*** Director's Review of LBNF and DUNE
</H1> <P>
DUNE/LBNF passed a director's review for planning its CD1 refresh,
which is now planned for 14-16 July at Fermilab.

<H1>
*** CERN SPC on DUNE prototype
</H1> <P>
After submitting an EOI to CERN in early October 2014, 214 members
of DUNE from 43 institutes in 7 countries submitted a Proposal
for a Full-Scale Prototype Single-Phase Liquid Ar Time Projection
Chamber and Detector Beam Test at CERN in June which was heard by
the SPSC h0ps://indico.cern.ch/event/397446/.  In draft minutes,
the Committee supports the motivation of the project & recognizes
the importance of the engineering and physics goals expressed in
the proposal.  They noted with pleasure progress in defining the
project and will review the technical implementation.

<H1>
*** NuMI horn to be replaced
</H1> <P>
In June it was decided to replace the current horn "PH1-04" due to
a severed stripline.  The 1st horn capable of running at NOvA's
design power of 700 kW, it accumulated 27 million pulses since
Sep 2013.  The failure is a severed stripline on 1 quadrant. The
horn can't be pulsed. A new one will be installed during the
shutdown. NuMI ran a few weeks horn off for MINOS+/NOvA/Minerva.

<H1>
*** NuFACT in Rio 10-15 August
</H1> <P>
Nothing is more interesting than neutrinos and no place is more
beautiful than Rio.  Put them together at NuFACT which is being
held at CBPF this year.  It's a walking distance from Sugarloaf,
where James Bond met his friend Jaws (not a shark) in Moonraker.

*** NNN 2015 at Stony Brook 28-31 October
</H1> <P>
The International Workshop on Next Generation Nucleon Decay and
Neutrino Detectors (NNN15) will be held at Stony Brook University
28-31 Oct. 2015.  The 1st day of the workshop will be dedicated to
Unification Day 2.  Grad students and postdocs are strongly
encouraged to attend. Funds are available from the workshop to
provide partial support to participants. There will be parallel
& poster sessions where grad students & postdocs can present.

*** Ross Shaft rehab and Yates shaft maintenance at SURF
</H1> <P>
Rehabbing in the Ross Shaft has been taking place for a few years
for Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) & DUNE.  All excavated
rock has to go through the Ross Shaft.  They have reached the 2450
level, about halfway.  Challenges arise as they remove old steel
and replace it. A challenging section comes next -the Ross Pillar,
a 1200-foot zone surrounded by a 3 ft thick concrete liner near
where they had mined.  Normal ground movement caused misalignment
and bowed some steel.  While Ross is being rehabbed, the Yates
Shaft is undergoing top-down maintenance. Built 75 years ago,
Yates was constructed of timber. Yates will serve DUNE and will
continue to move people, equipment, and supplies.

*** Memories of David Cline
</H1> <P>
A professor of physics at UCLA and the first U.S. physicist to
work on a large liquid argon neutrino detector, David Cline passed
away in June.  From Experiment 1 at Fermilab, to the new DUNE
collaboration, he has long worked on neutrino experiments.  He has
also been a keen leader in the search for Dark Matter.  I never met
him when he didn't have a new idea.  In 1993, he bet me $100 that
the atmospheric neutrino anomaly wasn't due to oscillations.  When
Kamiokande reported an angular dependence in 1994, he said he felt
like he already had $50 in his pocket.  I never understand what he
meant by that.  He paid me in 1999.
