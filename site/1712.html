<P> 


<H1>
*** ProtoDUNE progress
</H1> <P>
ProtoDUNE SP (Single Phase) is proceeding with the 1st clean room
operations recently completed.  All (12) Field Cage (FC) units are
complete and stored in the EHN1 building at CERN.  The Field Cage
End Walls are currently under production and will soon be sent to
EHN1.  The first of 6 planned Anode Plane Arrays (APAs) is in the
clean room cold box outside of the protoDUNE SP cryostat, cooled
to operating temperature and undergoing electronics testing.  The
2nd APA is also at CERN.  The first 2 panels of the Cathode Plane
Array (CPA) were assembled, lifted vertically, attached to their
beam trolleys, and paired together in the clean room.  Four FC
units (top and bottom on both sides of the CPA Panel pair) were
attached and placed in their folded configuration - ready for
insertion into the cryostat.  This CPA/FC unit is the first of 3.

*** New results from NOvA
</H1> <P>
The 14 kiloton NOvA experiment previously presented neutrino
oscillation results from an exposure equivalent to 6.05e20 POT.
New results from 8.85e20 POT could be presented at the
Fermilab JETP on 12 January 2018.

*** PDG updates for 2018
</H1> <P>
The Review of Particle Physics (RPP) continues to be a wonderful
source of review articles on all aspects of particle physics.

  The
extensive review on nu masses, mixing and oscillations is updated,

and there is a new and timely review on "Neutrinos in Cosmology"

*** neutrinos from neutron star mergers II
</H1> <P>
One calculation in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00449"> arXiv:1712.00449 </A>
 gets (optimistically) 10^(-4)
of the sensitivity of neutrino telescopes.  There should also
be abundant lower energy neutrinos from the R process.

<H1>
*** Fermilab Program Advisory Committee
</H1> <P>
The report from the November 2017 FNAL PAC meeting includes
recommendations on NOvA, MINERvA, MicroBooNE, LBNF/DUNE and
"Neutrino Interaction Theory".  They encouraged an EOI to use the
detectors in the Short-Baseline Program with a proton beam dump
to search for sub-GeV Dark Matter.

*** Neutrino meetings in 2017 and 2018
</H1> <P>
Although 45 meetings were listed on the neutrino meetings page
during 2017, I do miss some important meetings.  That was the
case for NBI17, the 10th Workshop on nu Beams & instrumentation
<A href="https://conference-indico.kek.jp/indico/event/16/"> 
https://conference-indico.kek.jp/indico/event/16/
 </A>.   
The year
2018 promises to be another great year for neutrino discussions,
highlighted by Neutrino 2018, NOW2018, NUFACT18 and Nu History.

*** Studies for a Solar Neutrino Orbiting Experiment
</H1> <P>
Do solar neutrinos provide a floor to direct Dark Matter searches?
Voyager now experiences a neutrino background 10^4 times smaller
than the earth.  In contrast, a solar orbiting lab close to the
sun will experience a higher nu flux than earth, and solar nus
could be studied with a small detector.  At seven solar radii,
where the Parker Probe will go, the rate is 1000 times higher, &
a detector at 3 radii, a NASA goal, another factor of 10.

*** Double Chooz finishes reactor data
</H1> <P>
The Double Chooz experiment, the first modern reactor experiment
to indicate a non-zero theta_13, has finished its physics run in
December of 2017.  A few calibration runs during January will
precede disassembly of the two detectors.

<H1>
*** Herve de Kerret, 1947-2017
</H1> <P>
Herve was spokesperson for the Double Chooz experiment from
conception through the end of running at the end of 2017.  As one
of the scientists who had also been on the Bugey and CHOOZ
experiments, he developed a special relationship with the reactor
company and the local community which made for a particularly
welcoming experience for scientists from around the world.

*** US Department of Energy's 40th birthday
</H1> <P>
Celebrating its 40th birthday, the DOE listed 40 research
milestones; 2 of which involved neutrinos:  the 2002 paper from
SNO showing solar neutrino oscillations and the 1998 result from
Super-Kamiokande on atmospheric neutrino oscillations.
