<h1> *** Reactor Theta-13 White Paper </h1>
 An International Working Group has prepared a "White Paper" on  the use
of a nuclear reactor to measure theta_13.  The 156 page  document, prepared
by 125 authors is available at <a href="http://www.neutrinooscillation.org/white.html">
  http://www.neutrinooscillation.org/white.html </a>
 Expect to see proposals within about a year.  
<p> </p>
<h1> *** MiniBooNE results in about a year </h1>
 MiniBooNE has a committment of 5 10^20 protons on target, and  have gotten
1.7 so far, with 2.5 10^19 in Jan 04.  They expect  significant improvements
from a collimator system installed  during the shutdown which will be deployed
soon.  The flux times  cross section is 50% higher than a Monte Carlo.  They'll
open  their "box" in their blind analysis in about a year.  
<p> </p>
<h1> *** NuMI beam in about a year </h1>
 The date for beam to the MINOS experiment has not slipped in 2 y.  
<p> </p>
<h1> *** Fermilab long range plan - proton driver </h1>
<pre wrap="">Fermilab's planning process has identified the proton driver as a significant <span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>part of its future. It has a varied physics program, but the primary motivation <span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>is the long-baseline neutrino program. A project team led by Bill Foster will <span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span><br>study technologies and project costs over the coming year in anticipation of a<span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span> real proposal to follow. In parallel, Eric Prebys is leading an effort to <span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>identify short term improvments to the existing linac and booster aimed at <span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>maximizing the protons available to Run II, MiniBoone, and MINOS over the next <span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>several years.</pre>

<h1> *** Underground Lab site independent support group </h1>
 A support/interest group for a US Underground Science and  Engineering Laboratory
was very recent started.  This is a  "nondenominational" effort, not connected
with any site.   The web page will endeavor to keep the community informed
about  all activities:   
<p> <a href="http://mocha.phys.washington.edu/NUSEL/">  http://mocha.phys.washington.edu/NUSEL/
</a>
 At this site you will find an electronic form.  Fill it  out to join the
group and email list.  The email list will be kept private, but will be available
to any community member  who has news about underground science or site developments.

<h1> *** Underground Lab Agreement for Homestake - is it enough? </h1>
 According to articles January 13 and 14 in the "Rapid City  Journal", S.D.
 Governor Mike Rounds signed a 6p agreement with Barrick Gold Corporation
which details how the state would protect Barrick from liability for any
donation of Homestake mine for an underground science lab.  First there is
a proposal for $3.5M for liability insurance, and $10M for initial construction,
 followed by a request to the NSF to guarantee bonds over the  first 5 years
of the lab.  He is now planning to support a Lab  with an estimated price
tag of $114M (previously $150M).    
<p> </p>
<h1> *** Underground Lab Letters of Interest - SNOLAB  </h1>
 Here is a link to a request for Letters-of-Interest in staging  experiments
at SNOLAB, a facility for underground science  presently under development
at INCO's Creighton Mine in Sudbury  Ontario, Canada.   The request is accompanied
by some guidelines  for drafting your LOI. Also included is a descriptive
on the  status of SNOLAB development and the process to develop  a scientific
program at the new laboratory.  <a href="http://www.neutrinooscillation.org/snolab.pdf">

<h1> *** GNO over? </h1>
 There is a rumor that the Gallium neutrino project at Gran Sasso  is over.
 If true I have no details.  If false there aren't any.  
<p> </p>
<h1> *** NSF 20 year facility plan? </h1>
 Some projects which didn't make the DOE Office of Science 20 year  facility
plan might be funded by the NSF, but large facilities  are only 4% of their
$5.5B budget.  But they need a  "roadmap for large-research facility projects
over the next 10-20  years", similar to the Orbach plan, according to a report
 "Setting Priorities for NSF-sponsored Large Research Facility  Project"
