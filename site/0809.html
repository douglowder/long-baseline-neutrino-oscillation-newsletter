*** CNGS running long-baseline nu beam from Switzerland to Italy
</h1> <p>

The 2008 CERN neutrino run has 5e18 protons on target (pot) up to
28 August.  They are now running at the design of 2e13 protons per
pulse &amp; 2 pulses per cycle, but they have only half the expected
pot (but the slope is increasing).  OPERA finished installing
146621 bricks in June, but the supplier ran out of lead and 5000
more will be installed at the end of the year.  They have 399
events on target so far, and expect 1 tau event by the end of the
year.   Borexino expects 315 events/day.  They see both prompt
events (from muons) as well as a secondary peak from neutrons.
LVD is seeing the beam as well, and ICARUS now expects to fill with
liquid argon in October.

*** CNGS finds earth's magnetic field
</h1> <p>
CNGS started running in 2006.  One anomaly was an asymmetry in the
horizontal muon counters, and a smaller one in the vertical
counters.  When they corrected for the earth's magnetic field,
including attenuation in the decay tube stainless steel, the
distributions were well explained.  Several problems found during
the 2007 run have been fixed for 2008.  They had a leak in the water
outlet of the cooling circuit of the reflector after 4e5 pulses.
This was traced to a design fault in ceramic insulator brazings
which have all been replaced.  Cracked busbar flexible connections
to the reflector were replaced with continuous plates.  A large
fraction of electronics were in a tunnel area where the ventilation
system failed due to radiation effects after 7.9e17pot.  The
electronics has now been moved and shielded.

*** Borexino sees two solar neutrino signals
</h1> <p>
Borexino has presented the first simultaneous measurement of solar
neutrinos from the vacuum dominated region (7Be) and from the
matter enhanced.  They also have the first measurement of 8B in
real time below 5 MeV.  They find the 8B neutrinos in the region
from 2.8 to 16.3 MeV, where they find 0.26 +-0.04(stat) +-0.02(sys)
count/day/100ton after cutting and subtracting several backgrounds.
Non-oscillation is excluded at 4.2 sigma.  Assuming the high-Z BP07
flux, P(ee) is 0.35 +- 0.10 at 8.6 MeV mean energy.  In the future
they'll study the CNO, pep and high energy pp neutrinos, as well as
geoneutrinos; and hope for a supernova.  See

*** LAGUNA scientists studying 7 underground sites in Europe
</h1> <p>
Large Apparatus for Grand Unification and Neutrino Astrophysics
The European ApPEC roadmap recommended a new large European
infrastructure be put forward, as a future international multi-
purpose facility on the 10^5-10^6 ton scale  for improved studies
of proton decay and of low-energy nus from astrophysical origin.
The LAGUNA structure was proposed and accepted Nov 2005.  Mature
design and proposals should emerge in 2010.  100 scientists from
11 European countries are studying 7 sites:  Boulby UK; CanFranc,
Spain; Frejus, France, Pyhasalmi, Finland; Sieroszowice, Poland;
Slanic, Romania; to be determined, Italy.  Baselines for neutrino
beams from CERN from 130 to 2300 km are available.

A good review of neutrino physics took place at NOW2008
Neutrino Oscillation Workshop.  Not only are the slides available
from the program web site, but streaming video too.  The first 4
sessions (hexahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron, icosahedron) were
organized in terms of increasing energy; the 5th session was
associated with all energy scales (tetrahedron).
