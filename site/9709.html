*** MINOS detector decision
</h1>The MINOS collaboration has chosen to built its calorimeter using
solid scintillator.  It chose this over liquid scintillator and
aluminum proportional tubes based on performance and ease of
operation.  Cost estimates for the three technologies were
similar.  A new scintillator working group headed by Doug Michael
has been set up to organize further R&amp;D needed for a TDR in 1998.

*** New CERN proposal/LOI for numu to nue at the PS
</h1>Essentially they would like to explore the region of the LSND
claim with high sensitivity, excellent control of the systematics
and in an energy regime different from LSND.  A draft in
preparation is at  http://choruswww.cern.ch/~pzucchel/loi/ps.ps
The final document goal for submission to the SPSC is the
beginning of Oct. (There's a committee meeting end of Oct.)

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrino Physics Group at Muon Collider Workshop
</h1>On Nov 6-9, Boris Kayser () &amp; Peter Fisher
() are the neutrino conveners at the Workshop
on Physics at the First Muon Collider and at the Front End of a
Muon Collider.  See fnphyx-www.fnal.gov/conferences/femcpw97/

<p> </p><h1>
*** NuTeV ends, DONUT finishes first run
</h1>NuTeV finished its data taking with 3.5 e18 protons on target,
and they're busy analysing their structure function data.  DONUT
ended their first run for their tau neutrino search on September
3rd. The emulsion targets were removed 4 and 5 Sep, grid printing
was done on 5 Sep.  Storage of the 120 unused ECC and SS sheets
for the next 14 months will be in the Soudan mine in Minnesota.
The estimated neutrino interactions in their targets is 1000.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Gallex ends run with high neutrino rate
</h1>The fourth and final run of Gallex showed the sun was a bit hot,
giving off 118 +- 12  SNU.   This raised the Gallex average to
76 +- 6 SNU.  SAGE gets 66 +-12 +-6 SNU.  Although noteworthy,
the high Gallex number for run 4 seems consistent with
statistical fluctuations.  The average of two source runs
gives a response of 0.92 +- 0.08 the expected rate.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Will a CERN-Gran Sasso long-baseline beam threaten GNO?
</h1>No.  The additional background is about 1.5%.  See report below.

<p> </p><h1>
*** The sun burns without a Wick
</h1>Wick Haxton with Andrew Cumming have proposed that He3 mixing in
the sun can get pp right, B8 low and Be7 very low.  Although its
not a complete model, earlier claims that non-standard solar
models can't explain the data seem to be wrong.  He still prefers
the MSW mechanism, but is intrigued by the consequences of this
idea.  But rather than work now on a dynamical solar model which
can exploit the idea, he is waiting for data from SNO.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Berezinsky feels misquoted in August LBL news
</h1>He feels that some of his remarks could be easily misunderstood
as given.  His reply is linked to the web version of Longbnews.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Diablo Avocado is Skeptical About Neutrino Oscillations
</h1>A skeptic (DA) has told Longbnews his doubts about new neutrino
physics.  He says:  It is not predicted by any theory, it is
non-parsimonious, adding more empirical parameters to the Standard
Model; for solar nus, a more parsimonious explanation is that the
solar models are wrong; for solar nus, the only evidence is too
few events.  Maybe detectors are less sensitive;  no energy
dependence has yet been seen;  no day-night effect has been seen;
for atmospheric neutrinos, the only evidence is consistent with
too few munus.  Maybe detectors are less sensitive;  A more
parsimonious explanation is that the flux models are wrong;  no
statistically significant energy dependence or zenith angle effect
has yet been reported;  None of the experiments that see possible
indications of neutrino oscillations are done at accelerators.
He concludes "The absence of a reason to believe is a reason to
disbelieve."  Question- Does Diablo Avocado believe in Guacamole?
