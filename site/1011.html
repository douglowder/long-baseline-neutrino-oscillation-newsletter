*** NOvA reaches milestone
</h1> <p>
The NOvA Project has met the Level 1 Milestone "Integration 
Prototype Near Detector (IPND) ready to take data". This milestone 
was met on November 24, 2010, when the NOvA group was able to 
synchronize all 6 Data Concentrator Modules in the IPND  to the 
current time, and obtain synchronized cosmic ray track data 
through the multiple IPND detector blocks.   This milestone 
represents important progress for the NOvA detector, and an 
intense effort on the part of the NOvA group which will continue 
as they move into the initial data taking phases. The group is now 
able to  proceed to work with beam triggers and will begin 
searching for neutrino events in the off-axis NuMI beam.

*** NSF funding delay/denial for 2011 DUSEL
</h1> <p>
On 2 Dec, the National Science Board's Committee on Program and
Plans voted not to recommend the proposed DUSEL bridge award to 
the full NSB.  National Science Foundation staff will be working 
with their counterparts at DOE, Berkeley, and other stakeholders 
to assess next steps.  This money is $29M in bridge funding to 
partially cover DUSEL expenses until the start of full NSF 
funding.  The rumored reason is the status of the stewardship 
model between NSF and DOE.  That means who is responsible for each
physics component (Neutrino oscillation, double beta decay, dark
Matter) when the lab is open.  An article in Science before the 
action, with the colorful title "Scientific Gold Mine or Dicey
Money Pit" discusses some of the challenges facing DUSEL.

An interview 
with 1 NSB member confirms his main concern is operations costs.

*** Neutrino Protest in Italy

See

Students and 
professors protest against the reform of the Italian university.
The linked picture taken this month was taken in Pisa. The 
translation is "More Neutrinos Less Gelmini." Gelmini is the 
present minister of the education for Italy.

*** New limit on delta msquared_32 in Particle Data Book
</h1> <p>
The 2010 Review of Particle Physics (RPP) by the PDG has been 
published and delivered to most, along with the small pocket book.
The best value of dmsq_32 is  2.43 +-0.13 10^-3 eV^2, compared to 
1.9-3.0 in 2008.  The new value will be replaced in 2012 when the
MINOS result shown at Neutrino 2010 is published in a refereed
journal.  Get the latest

*** New limit on theta_13 from Chooz
</h1> <p>
The limit on theta_13 in the 2010 RPP is sin^2(2-theta_13) < 0.15,
compared to .19 in 2008.  I've been at meetings where 4 different
numbers were called the CHOOZ limit.  No, the limit doesn't change
but it depends on dmsq_32, and its error.  Some quote the limit at
a "best fit" dmsq, but since the dependence is asymmetric, that 
means there is a 50% chance that the true 90% CL limit is worse.
The problem was dealt with in the 2008 RPP by quoting theta_13 at
the 1 sigma low value of Super-K's dmsq, and putting the best fit
limit in a footnote.  In 2010, the RPP uses the bet fit value, and
the 1 sigma low value is in a footnote.  New results, which have 
to deal with delta and hierarchy, only analyze at one dmsq.  The
right way would be a global fit; PDG doesn't encode  global fits.

The 2010 RPP has a new review on neutrino mass and mixing, by 
Petcov and Nakamura.  The previous review was by Kayser.

*** New book on neutrinos by Bilenky
</h1> <p>
If you have a book on neutrino mass and mixing, it is probably out 
of date.  You can fix that this Christmas, at least for a while, 
by adding Samoil Bilenky's "Introduction to the physics of massive 
and mixed neutrinos" to your wish list.  "I hope that this book 
will be useful for the physicists working in neutrino physics, for 
students and young physicists who plan to enter into this exciting 
field and to many scientists who are interested in the history of 
neutrino physics and its present status."

*** SNIF: A Futuristic Neutrino Probe for Undeclared ... Reactors
</h1> <p>
The SNIF (Secret Neutrino Interactions Finder) concept proposes to 
use a few hundred thousand tons neutrino detectors to unveil 
clandestine fission reactors. Beyond previous studies it provides 
estimates of all known background sources as a function of the 
detector's longitude, latitude and depth, and we discuss how they 
impact the detectability.
