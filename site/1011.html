*** NOvA reaches milestone
</h1> <p>
The NOvA Project has met the Level 1 Milestone "Integration
Prototype Near Detector (IPND) ready to take data". This milestone
was met on November 24, 2010, when the NOvA group was able to
synchronize all 6 Data Concentrator Modules in the IPND  to the
current time, and obtain synchronized cosmic ray track data
through the multiple IPND detector blocks.   This milestone
represents important progress for the NOvA detector, and an
intense effort on the part of the NOvA group which will continue
as they move into the initial data taking phases. The group is now
able to  proceed to work with beam triggers and will begin
searching for neutrino events in the off-axis NuMI beam.

*** NSF funding delay/denial for 2011 DUSEL
</h1> <p>
On 2 Dec, the National Science Board's Committee on Program and
Plans voted not to recommend the proposed DUSEL bridge award to
the full NSB.  National Science Foundation staff will be working
with their counterparts at DOE, Berkeley, and other stakeholders
to assess next steps.  This money is $29M in bridge funding to
partially cover DUSEL expenses until the start of full NSF
funding.  The rumored reason is the status of the stewardship
model between NSF and DOE.  That means who is responsible for each
physics component (Neutrino oscillation, double beta decay, dark
Matter) when the lab is open.  An article in Science before the
action, with the colorful title "Scientific Gold Mine or Dicey
Money Pit" discusses some of the challenges facing DUSEL.

An interview
with 1 NSB member confirms his main concern is operations costs.

*** Neutrino Protest in Italy

Students and
professors protest against the reform of the Italian university.
The linked picture taken this month was taken in Pisa. The
translation is "More Neutrinos Less Gelmini." Gelmini is the
present minister of the education for Italy.

*** New limit on delta msquared_32 in Particle Data Book
</h1> <p>
The 2010 Review of Particle Physics (RPP) by the PDG has been
published and delivered to most, along with the small pocket book.
The best value of dmsq_32 is  2.43 +-0.13 10^-3 eV^2, compared to
1.9-3.0 in 2008.  The new value will be replaced in 2012 when the
MINOS result shown at Neutrino 2010 is published in a refereed
journal.  Get the latest

*** New limit on theta_13 from Chooz
</h1> <p>
The limit on theta_13 in the 2010 RPP is sin^2(2-theta_13) &lt; 0.15,
compared to .19 in 2008.  I've been at meetings where 4 different
numbers were called the CHOOZ limit.  No, the limit doesn't change
but it depends on dmsq_32, and its error.  Some quote the limit at
a "best fit" dmsq, but since the dependence is asymmetric, that
means there is a 50% chance that the true 90% CL limit is worse.
The problem was dealt with in the 2008 RPP by quoting theta_13 at
the 1 sigma low value of Super-K's dmsq, and putting the best fit
limit in a footnote.  In 2010, the RPP uses the bet fit value, and
the 1 sigma low value is in a footnote.  New results, which have
to deal with delta and hierarchy, only analyze at one dmsq.  The
right way would be a global fit; PDG doesn't encode  global fits.

The 2010 RPP has a new review on neutrino mass and mixing, by
Petcov and Nakamura.  The previous review was by Kayser.

*** New book on neutrinos by Bilenky
</h1> <p>
If you have a book on neutrino mass and mixing, it is probably out
of date.  You can fix that this Christmas, at least for a while,
by adding Samoil Bilenky's "Introduction to the physics of massive
and mixed neutrinos" to your wish list.  "I hope that this book
will be useful for the physicists working in neutrino physics, for
students and young physicists who plan to enter into this exciting
field and to many scientists who are interested in the history of
neutrino physics and its present status."

*** SNIF: A Futuristic Neutrino Probe for Undeclared ... Reactors
</h1> <p>
The SNIF (Secret Neutrino Interactions Finder) concept proposes to
use a few hundred thousand tons neutrino detectors to unveil
clandestine fission reactors. Beyond previous studies it provides
estimates of all known background sources as a function of the
detector's longitude, latitude and depth, and we discuss how they
impact the detectability.
