<h1>Long-Baseline news, October 2013 </h1>
<p>

</p><h1>
*** P5
</h1> <p>
The Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5) is charged
to develop a strategic plan for U.S. particle physics that can be
executed over a ten-year timescale, in the context of a 20-year
global vision for the field.  It has a meeting schedule including
Fermilab in November, Brookhaven and SLAC in December. The final
report, which will represent the U.S. particle physics community's
consensus roadmap recommendations for the next decade, is due in
spring 2014 and will be delivered to HEPAP for review before it is
officially submitted to the funding agencies.

*** The best baseline for a long-baseline experiment?
</h1> <p>
A study on the optimization of a long-baseline nu experiment for
mass hierarchy and CP violation has been presented in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0212"> arXiv:1311.0212. </a>
The authors find that a detector at a baseline
of at least 1000 km is optimal for these studies.

</p><h1>
*** Reorientation of Project X
</h1> <p>
Fermilab is reorienting the Project X program to provide &gt; 1 MW
of neutrinos on day one of LBNE operations.  An affordable project
would start by upgrading the linac, develop high power target
capability and build a platform for a multi-MW future.  Details of
this new plan will be presented at the BNL P5 meeting in December.

</p><h1>
*** Young Snowmass survey
</h1> <p>
There was a survey among the young physicists in the U.S. as part
of the SNOWMASS summer study, and the results are tabulated in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.8080"> arXiv:1307.8080.
</a>
LBNE was the experiment that the intensity
frontier participants were the most excited about (Figure 35).

</p><h1>
*** Neutron lifetime - it's a bit of a mess
</h1> <p>
The PDG value for the neutron lifetime is 880 +- 0.9 s.  This is
based on results from the "bottle" method.  In contrast, the value
in 2006 was 885.7 +- 0.9 s.  The "beam" method had obtained larger
values.  A new determination made by recalibrating a previous beam
monitor and using 2005 data gives 887.7 +- 2.3 s.  This number
impacts the size of the reactor neutrino anomaly.

</p><h1>
*** I need a vacation
</h1> <p>
The national labs weren't closed by the U.S. government shutdown,
but some of them got very close.  I had made some plans about what
to do if there was a furlough, and I was looking forward to them.

</p><h1>
*** LBNE has flexibility, even after CD1
</h1> <p>
The level of flexibility that LBNE has with the DOE funding,
specifically that it is allowed, even encouraged, to build a
detector underground and larger.  Funding ideas continue.

</p><h1>
*** The significance of significance
</h1> <p>
Some people treat the notion that we need 5 sigma about everything
to increase our knowledge akin to one of Newton's laws.  Louis
Lyons in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1284"> arXiv:1310.1284
</a>
suggests that other things matter.  He
says nu oscillations could have been discovered with 4 sigma, (and
he wrote the book on statistics.)  I think this misses the bigger
problem, that people treat a-priori and a-posteriori tests the
same.  Also, we are trying to measure the mass hierarchy, not
discover it.  There is a mass hierarchy, with two possible values.
A related issue covered in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.3651"> 1210.3651
</a>
is that the design of an
experiment needs to deal with both its expected sensitivity, and
the fluctuations that it is likely to encounter.  Also

*** LBNE 35 ton
</h1> <p>
LBNE is building a 35 ton prototype detector at Fermilab.
The installation work for the 35t cryostat and cryogenics system
is now complete.
The goal of the 35t Phase I setup is to
demonstrate operation with high purity for a system based on a
membrane cryostat. The 35t cryostat is the first membrane cryostat
in the US and the first cryostat built for scientific purposes.
The budget calls for testing and operations for the cryogenics
system from the beginning of October to the end of the year.
