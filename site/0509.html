*** CERN plans for neutrinos
</h1>
CERN is understandably focused on the LHC.  The CNGS neutrino 
beam will be commissioned 4/06; 1st nus in May.  The first target 
magazine was completed 7/05, and horn 1 was renovated and equipped 
with an automatic water connector.  Robert Aymar has a "strategy 
group" to study options for the future.  That group will meet near 
Berlin in spring 2006 and report to the July 2006 CERN Council 
meeting.  Possibilities, along with ILC and CLIC include a 
multi-MW proton driver for a neutrino superbeam, a neutrino 
factory or a beta beam.   No significant funding till 2010.

<p> <h1>
*** Fermilab plans for neutrinos
</h1>
Neutrinos make up two of the five parts of Fermilab's current and 
future program: 1.) Tevatron, 2.) MINOS/MiniBooNe, 3.) LHC, 4.) 
NOvA 1 & NOvA 2, 5.) Linear Collider.  The current experiments 
MiniBooNE and MINOS are taking data and should have results soon.  
Two scenarios for the future were considered.  If the Global 
Design effort proposes a linear collider which seems affordable, 
that will become Fermilab's priority, and there will be no proton 
driver.  There are VERY EARLY creative ideas on how to deliver 
1-2MW at 120 GeV without a driver.  If the linear collider seems 
likely considerably delayed (decision after 2012), then a proton 
driver would be proposed next year and ready by 2012.  NOvA II 
refers to a liquid argon detector at the second oscillation max.

*** KEK/Japan plans for neutrinos
</h1>
KEK stands for the Inter-University Research Institute Corporation 
High Energy Research Accelerator Organization (I always wondered 
about that.)  K2K long-baseline neutrino project from KEK to 
Kamioka was terminated in 12/04 with 9.2 10^19 protons on target 
(pot).  The 12 GeV PS will end 12/05.  Neutrinos from JPARC/Tokai 
(T2K) will start in April 2009 at .75 MW.  There are several 
options to increase the power of the beam

(see slide 20 of Totsuka). </a>

*** China plans for neutrinos
</h1>
IHEP-Beijing is working on the Daya Bay reactor neutrino proposal, 
With the combination of 4 reactors (to be 6 by 2010), and high 
nearby mountains to provide overburden, it is an ideal site for a 
sensitive theta-13 experiment.  The Nuclear Power Station is happy 
to cooperate with the project and a site study and tunnel design 
are underway.  Chinese funding agencies agreed to support.  Also a 
JPARC-Beijing long-baseline neutrino experiment is under study.

<p> <h1>
*** Other lab plans for neutrinos
</h1>
SLAC is working on the Xe neutrinoless double beta decay experiment 
EXO, which can tag both the two electrons and the remaining 
Barium.   DESY is working on Baikal and Ice-cube.  Brookhaven is 
studying scintillator for reactor experiments and also a 
long-baseline neutrino beam to DUSEL in Homestake or Henderson.

<p> <h1>
*** RENO to measure theta-13 in Korea
</h1>
In Korea, there are 17 MW reactor complexes at Uljin and at 
Younggwang.  The RENO collaboration (Reactor Experiment for 
Neutrino Oscillations) is planning 20 ton (fiducial volume) near 
and far detectors, sensitive to sin^2 2-theta13 > 0.03.  

<p> <h1>
*** New Reactor theta-13 Experiment comparison
</h1>
A temporarily up-to-date comparison of the six reactor experiments 
(ANGRA, Braidwood, Daya Bay, Double Chooz, KASKA and RENO) was 
prepared for ICFA with "optimistic start dates" for all 6.

*** Bahcall tribute October 29 in Princeton
</h1>
A celebration of John's distinguished life and work will be held 
on Saturday, 10/29 at the Institute for Advanced Study.  Coffee 
will be served in Fuld Hall starting at 9:00 a.m. Scientific 
lectures will take place 10-12:30 in Wolfensohn Hall. Personal
tributes will begin at 2:00, and a reception at 4.

*** Neutrino 2006
</h1>
Neutrino 2006 will be in Santa Fe New Mexico June 14-19 2006.
It will be a truly memorable meeting commemorating the 50th 
anniversary of the neutrino discovery.

*** Protons needed to make neutrinos at Fermilab
</h1>
Before MiniBooNe, an estimate of the total number of accelerated 
protons in the history of Fermilab is 5 10^20.  MiniBooNe has 
taken 6.3 10^20 pot to date and will continue with 2.0 10^20 
protons per year during NuMI running.  The NuMI/MINOS goal is 
7.4 10^20 in 3 years or 25 10^20 in 7 years.  The highest number 
that could be found on a NOvA slide is 150 10^20.

*** Low American Institute for Physics FYI neutrino cross section
</h1>
FYI#128 described the 09/05 DOE/NSF Nuclear Advisory Committee 
meeting.  It says the meeting was mostly a report from NuSAG, 
then it doesn't mention it.
