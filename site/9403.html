</p><h1>Fermilab Call for Long Baseline EOI's</h1>
As directed by the Fermilab PAC, Ken Stanfield has sent a letter
to Fermilab Users soliciting Expression's of Interest for a
long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment.  No longer than
10 pages, they are due May 16, 1994.  (This is the same timescale
as the EOI's for new collider experiments, for which LOI's are
due in January '95, and proposals in May 95.)  At the DOE user's
day (below), Ken Stanfield reminded people that an EOI is not a
proposal.  Realistic Main Injector parameters were given as 5
10^13 120GeV ppp every 1.9 sec.

</p><h1>Snowmass Long Baseline Workshop</h1>
We are scheduling atmospheric and long baseline working sessions
at Snowmass.  Subject to coordination with other working groups,
The Atmospheric Neutrino sessions will be July 1-July 5, and the
long baseline discussions will be July 8 to July 12.

</p><h1>CERN Long Baseline Working Group Set Up</h1>
The working group will look at beam design and detector capabilities
and should define physics goals.  We expect that the working group
will produce a document to be submitted to the HEP community (including
CERN, INFN, DOE. etc).  The ultimate goal(s) for this working group
should be up to the participants so we will not attempt to define
at this time what the work of the group may lead to for the future.
The inaugural meeting of the group will be 10:00 am on April 26th at
the Gran Sasso Lab.  Anyone interested may attend.  If you would like
to make a presentation at this  meeting on work that you have done or
ideas about future possibilities, please contact either Flavio Cavanna
or Doug Michael.  Doug Michael &amp; Flavio Cavanna

</p><h1>JPL/CALTECH Neutrino Astrophysics Technology Workshop</h1>
A workshop on possibilities of building a very large
(1kmx1km (x1km?)) detector for muons produced by high energy
neutrinos was held at JPL on 23-24 of March.   It is anticipated
that the scale of such a project would benefit from connection
with a large laboratory.  AMANDA, DUMAND and lake Baikal projects
and JPL people were represented.  Discussion focussed on current
understanding of the  necessary technology and what the best
technology and implementation plan might be for the future. It was
agreed that we need to see some results from these detectors
before a clear path can be defined towards a future very large
detector.  Technology developments that were identified are
cheaper large-area photo-detection, fast digitization of signals,
fast transfer of large amounts of data over fiber networks and
reliability of systems which are not easily recovered. Area vs.
volume detectors or a surface vs deep were rehashed... no clear
consensus. The JPL management concluded that they would be
interested in participating in this project. The future of this
possibility will go on at this summer's Snowmass meeting.

</p><h1>822 preparation for April PAC meeting</h1>
The April PAC meeting will consider P-822, as well as P-872 and
E-803 on Friday morning April 8th.  In March we submitted an
update to our proposal, focusing on systematic errors and energy
measurement.   Our document switched notation from R = nc/cc
to T = cc/(nc+cc) because it is more straightforward to study
acceptance and misidentification in a two station experiment
with the T variable.   The Statistical error on T, dT=.01, while
the largest systematic errors, from electron neutrinos and
reconstruction failures were under dT=.002.

</p><h1>Gallex paper submitted to Physics Letters B, February 1994</h1>
They report new GALLEX solar neutrino results from 15 runs covering
406  days (live time) within the exposure period 19 August 1992-13
October 1993  ("GALLEX II"). With counting data considered until
4 January 1994, the new  result is [78 +/- 13 (stat) +/- 5 (syst)] SNU
(1 sigma). It confirms their previous result for the 15 initial runs
("GALLEX I") of [81 +/- 17 (stat) +/-9 (syst)] SNU.  After two years
of recording the solar neutrino flux with the GALLEX detector,
the combined result from 30 solar runs (GALLEX I + GALLEX II) is
[79 +/- 10 (stat) +/- 6 (syst)] SNU (1 sigma). In addition, 19 "blank" runs
gave the expected null result.

</p><h1>Lakes, Roads and Fish</h1>
At the Annual DOE User's day, Gina Rameika gave a very nice
presentation on the possibility for 822 at Fermilab, and
concluded that when you are on a fishing expedition and want to
catch a big fish, the first step may be to build a road to the
lake.  John O'Fallon asked if she was sure this was the right
lake.  Since the Soudan proposal has a large number of tests of
neutrino oscillations, and consistency checks available, we can
correctly advertise Minnesota as the land of 10,000 lakes.
In discussions, the DOE was positive about the NUMI program.
<p>
</p><h1>Soudan meeting</h1>
At the Soudan Meeting in Oxford, there was considerable discussion
of using Soudan modules as the calorimeter for the 872 proposal.
<p>
</p><h1>KEK beam test running</h1>
The beam test of the Cerenkov counter in an electron beam has
taken some data with the Kamioka tubes which will be reported at
Neutrino '94.  Rumor has it that electron rings look like
electron ring Monte Carlo events.   There are also a proposal
for a neutrino beam to be built at the same site (see design
report below).  It would give 700 neutrino events per day in 200
tons.  In July, the KEK test beam will also test the IMB tubes.
