*** Shaking up the Neutrino World
</h1>
The APS Neutrino Study was presented to the funding agencies and 
was well received.  Nearly final drafts are available on the 
working group pages, and the final draft will soon be posted at
<a href="http://www.interactions.org/cms/?pid=1009695"> 
http://www.interactions.org/cms/?pid=1009695.  </a>
Recommendations:
1.  as a high priority, that a phased program of neutrinoless 
nuclear double beta decay be initiated as soon as possible.
2.  as a high priority, a comprehensive U.S. program to complete 
our understanding of neutrino mixing, to determine the character 
of the neutrino mass spectrum, and to search for CP violation 
among neutrinos.  This program should have the following 
components: a) an expeditiously deployed multi-detector reactor 
experiment with sensitivity down to sin^2 2q = 0.01.
b) a timely accelerator experiment with comparable sensitivity 
and sensitivity to the mass hierarchy through matter effects.
c) a proton driver in the megawatt class or above and neutrino 
superbeam with an appropriate very large detector capable of 
observing CP violation and measuring the neutrino mass-squared 
differences and mixing parameters with high precision.
3) the development of a spectroscopic solar neutrino experiment 
capable of measuring the energy spectrum of neutrinos from the 
primary pp fusion process in the sun.

*** Shaking up a few (reactor) neutrino physicists
</h1>
There was a recent magnitude 6.8 quake in Japan.  The epicenter of 
the quake was only 30 km from Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power 
station. The quake caused derailment of the 200 km/hr Shinkansen 
train which took 2km to completely stop after the safety system 
operated.  Very fortunately (it can be said it is a miracle) no 
one was injured.  Around the epicenter,  more than 100,000 people 
were evacuated.  The KASKA group was in charge of the boring study 
in the power station and had  just finished digging the 70m depth 
6.6 cm diameter hole 1 day before the quake. 3 KASKA collaborators 
stayed in the area to prepare the cosmic-ray and gamma ray 
detectors to put in the hole.  At the time of the first quake, 
they were in a hotel near the power station and felt the strong 
quake.  A power outage took place.  They were evacuated and stayed 
outside until midnight being afraid of the aftershocks. (many were 
magnitude 5-6).  KASKA was concerned that the boring hole might be 
collapsed by the quake.  But it survived!  They put in the 
detectors feeling some aftershocks, and measured background data.

*** Braidwood R&D Proposal for Reactor Neutrinos
</h1>
The Braidwood collaboration includes 68 people from 13 
institutions.  They have submitted a 1 year site-specific R&D 
proposal for $1M and plan to submit a full proposal in one year.  
The cost estimate is $66M.  It's led by E. Blucher & M. Shaevitz.

*** CHOOZ-US proposal for Double-CHOOZ Reactor Neutrinos
</h1>
A group of 20 physicists from 7 U.S. Institutions has proposed a 
$5M 3-year program to join Double-CHOOZ to measure theta-13.  If 
fully approved in 05, far detector would start 07.  It's led by 
R. Svoboda & M. Goodman.

*** Brookhaven Proton Driver Proposal
</h1>
Brookhaven has sent a letter to the DOE as a preliminary proposal 
to construct a Super Neutrino Beam at BNL,using the upgraded AGS 
as a 1 MW proton driver.  This follows the design for a Very 
Long-Baseline Neutrino Oscillations Experiment.  The Total 
Estimated Cost (TEC) is $407M.  A conceptual design is available:

*** Fermilab Proton Driver Workshop 
</h1>
The Proton Driver workshop was an initial workshop, and should 
be regarded as the start of a process. Though some of the 
discussions were around well-known issues (e.g. neutrino physics), 
it included how proton driver physics will fit into the global 
HEP program. Some new ideas included a low energy muon program
for both fundamental and applied research, and the problem of 
achieving the long spill beams needed for kaon physics. Currently, 
achieving regular slow spills from the Main Injector while 
controlling activation remains an issue.  One idea is to use the 
Tevatron instead. The present 9 month effort will result in a 
report in late 04 and workshops are expected to continue.
