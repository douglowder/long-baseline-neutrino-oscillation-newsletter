*** Neutrinoland
</h1>The dedication of the Soudan mine/physics lab was the occasion of 
much praise for the study of neutrinos.  e.g.

*** Neutrino Factory in UK?
</h1>There was great interest at NUFAC02 among British science 
officials in the neutrino factory concept.

The next step could be MICE, the muon cooling experiment at ISIS, 
a 10 million UK pound project.

<p> <h1>
*** Long-baseline neutrino parameter degeneracies
</h1>If you make a measurement of something like an event rate, and it 
maps into two possible values of a physics parameter, this is 
called a degeneracy.  In extracting neutrino mixing angles and CP 
phases it is increasingly apparent that such degeneracies are 
possible and must be kept in mind.  Mena's  discussion at NUFAC02 
<a href="http://www.hep.ph.ic.ac.uk/NuFact02/Scientific-programme/files/Wednesday/wg2/A05_mena.ps"> 
http://www.hep.ph.ic.ac.uk/NuFact02/Scientific-programme/files/Wednesday/wg2/A05_mena.ps
</a>
It focuses on Theta_13 and CP-delta degeneracies.  This 
emphasizes the need for experiments at many L/E's.  Also see
Burguet-Castell et al., 
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0207080"> (hep-ph/0207080) </a>
which states, 
"Superbeams and Neutrino Factories are not alternative 
facilities for exploring neutrino oscillation physics, but 
successive steps. 

<p> <h1>
*** MiniBooNE Full
</h1>On Friday May 3 saw the last of 250,000 gallons of pure mineral 
oil pumped into the MiniBooNE detector. This successfully
concludes a process which started on 7-Dec-2001 when the 
first two railcars of oil were delivered to the site.

*** 3M

and you'll learn "anything is possible with 
enough duct tape".  This proposal is for 10 100kt H20 detectors 
at NUSL for proton decay, supernova neutrinos, UHE neutrinos from 
astrophysical sources, and long-baseline neutrino oscillations.  
A SAGENAP presentation focused on the latter, though that is 
outside their charge (Scientific Assessment Group on Experimental 
Non-Accelerator Physics, a committee chaired by Eugene Loh (NSF) 
and James Stone (DOE).  SAGENAP didn't see anything to approve or 
disapprove, but urged cooperation among groups seeking to 
establish a large underground detector program for the US.

*** Super-Kamiokande Repair funded in US
</h1>Super-K is in the process of redistributing its unbroken PMT's 
for 50% of the original inner photocathode density, and replacing 
the broken out tubes.  The outer tubes were a traditional US 
responsibility.  SAGENAP strongly endorsed the Super-K repair 
proposal, noting "... the funding of $2.1M to the US groups must 
be one of the historic bargains in science funding."  For 2003, 
KEK will extend the run from 6 months to one year for K2K.

<p> <h1>
*** Where are all the nuclear powered submarines today?
</h1>Detwiler et al. 
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0207001"> (hep-ex/0207001) </a>
look at the effect of naval 
nuclear reactors  on the study of oscillations.  The presence of 
naval reactors at unknown locations and times may limit the 
accuracy of future very-long-baseline reactor-based neutrino 
oscillation experiments.  But use of a large Russian Icebreaker 
for precision experiments is also possible.  The possibility of 
running the reactors at full power with the ship stationary needs 
to be investigated.
