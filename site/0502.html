<p> </p><h1>
*** The President has a budget -- Neutrino Physics emerging
</h1>
A long-term goal is a construction start on an international
Linear Collider in the next decade.  "To provide a nearer-term
future program, and to preserve future research options, R&amp;D for
other new accelerator and detector technologies, particularly
in the emerging area of neutrino physics, will also increase."

<p> </p><h1>
*** NuMI beam has neutrinos in it
</h1>
As the NuMI beam is dedicated, running with intensities greater
than 2 10^13 ppp has been achieved.  The NuMI project has
achieved CD4, which means it goes out of existence as a project,
while operations commence.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Nuclear physics has a mission - without theta_13
</h1>
A few years ago, solar neutrinos, which led to the discovery of
theta_12, were funded only by nuclear physics at DOE.  The rumor
is that theta_13 projects, including reactor, will not be funded
by nuclear physics at DOE.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Staffin has a plan for the medium term medium size experiments.
</h1>
At HEPAP, new experiments under consideration were neutrinos,
neutrinos, neutrinos, neutrinos, dark matter and dark energy.
I'm paraphrasing of course.  Reactor &amp; Accelerator long-baseline
experiments for theta_13 were 1st &amp; 2nd in this unordered list.

<p> </p><h1>
*** DOE &amp; NSF to have a Neutrino Scientific Advisory Group (NUSAG)
</h1>
To help decide which experiments to do, the U.S. funding agencies
need advice.  The APS study prioritized the physics
opportunities.  Now a Scientific Advisory Group will be appointed
to study three areas of neutrino physics, new reactor
experiments, new accelerator experiments, and neutrinoless double
beta decay experiments, to recommend specific projects.  Then P5.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Double Chooz has a name
</h1>
The CHOOZ reactor neutrino experiment was usually capitalized,
not because it was an acronym, but because people thought it was
one.  The Double Chooz experiment, which met in the U.S. for the
first time in February, has chosen a convention for its name,
which is Double Chooz, without a dash and without all caps.  It
also has a logos, which is on the oscillation industry pages at

<p> </p><h1>
*** Brazil has a collaboration for ANGRA reactor experiment
</h1>
At the 4th Workshop on Future Low Energy Neutrino Experiments,
the Brazilian attendees formed a collaboration to fully
develop the proposal for a reactor theta_13 experiment at the
ANGRA nuclear power plant.  Three working groups were formed to
consider the physics case, the detector design, and site issues.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Korea has an idea for a reactor experiment
</h1>
The second largest source of neutrinos in the world is the
Younggwang site in southern South Korea.  There are six reactor
units in a line, and several hills nearby.  A Korean group is
investigating site issues, funding for civil construction, and
the physics reach of a theta_13 experiment there.

<p> </p><h1>
*** ICE-cube has a string
</h1>
Optical modules for four strings have been at the pole since
January.  One was successfully installed this summer.  They had
hoped for up to four strings, but drilling is not predictable,
in particular with a new gigantic drill.  Although significant
progress was made this year, there were setbacks, including an
accident that injured a driller. The driller was evacuated
to a hospital in New Zealand and has since recovered.

<p> </p><h1>
*** MiniBooNE has a new (off-axis) trigger
</h1>
MiniBooNE studies neutrinos from the 8 GeV booster, but NuMI
makes a 2 GeV narrow band beam from Kaon decays at MiniBooNE.
Also a good number of nu-e's will soon arrive.  They have added
a trigger with the NuMI beam gate.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Reactor Neutrino simulators have a Theta-13 workshop
</h1>
Kansas State will host a workshop on detector simulation for
reactor neutrino experiments 14-15 June.  Speakers from
Braidwood, Double Chooz, and Daya Bay, plus experts on SNO,
KAMLAND, Geant4, neutron transport, cosmic ray flux, and more.
