*** Lincoln Wolfenstein 1923-2015
</H1> <P>

The W in MSW, he was an early subscriber to this newsletter and a
strong advocate of the long-baseline neutrino program at Fermilab.
Here are some of his not-quite-quotes as I remember them:
<br>
1.  On quarks - For a long time I thought that quarks were a
mathematical model and weren't "real" but when I found that I
couldn't write a paper without mentioning quarks, they were real.
<br>
2.  On neutrinos - As a student at Chicago, I walked next to Stagg
Field where the test reactor CP1 in the squash court was pouring
out trillions of neutrinos.  Of course I didn't know, but if I
had known I would have walked on the other side of the street.
<br>
3.  On neutrino mass theories - We have thousands of theories,
which is like having no theory at all.
<br>
4.  To an experimenter at a talk on the CKM matrix - I invented
rho & eta and I don't care what their values are; why should you?

*** Second Global Neutrino Infrastructures Meeting

In the 2nd meeting, agency representatives were impressed by the
rapidity, quality of convergence and momentum of the efforts of
the community working on LAr TPCs to develop a credible program
based on: an ambitious large infrastructure effort, consisting of
a long-baseline beam and detector project (LBNF/DUNE) hosted at
FNAL and SURF, based on previous design studies, but largely
upgrading them, proposed by an international collaboration, very
rapidly setting up its governance structure and preparing answers
to an aggressive schedule of DOE critical design reviews; a medium
scale program of short-baseline oscillation experiments (SBND,
MicroBooNE and ICARUS) aiming to test the sterile neutrino
hypothesis with unprecedented accuracy; a rich R&D and prototyping
program in the CERN North Area, related to the above program along
with other long-baseline efforts in the world (e.g. Hyper-K).

<H1>
*** DUNE Technical Coordinator (TC) and Resource Coordinator (RC)
</H1> <P>
The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) now has a fully
functioning executive committee consisting of 10 members.  Two
important members are the TC (Eric James) and RC (Chang Kee Jung)
chosen by FNAL's director and DUNE co-spokespersons.  The TC
monitors and coordinates the activities of all subsystems and is
responsible for the overall technical performance, planning and
scheduling.  The RC is responsible for coordinating financial
planning and other resources issues of the collaboration.

NuFact15
is the seventeenth in a series that started in 1999 as an important
yearly workshop with emphasis on future neutrino projects. This will
be the first edition in Latin America, showing the scientific growth
of this field.  Topics cover nu oscillations, scattering, muon
physics and accelerator physics.

<H1>
*** New Book on Neutrino Oscillations
</H1> <P>
F. Suekane's book "Neutrino Oscillations: A Practical Guide to
Basics and Applications" is published from Springer Lecture Notes
in Physics 898. It was written for experimentalists.

*** NOvA wins U.S. DOE's Secretary's Award of Excellence
</H1> <P>
The NOvA project team successfully constructed the U.S.'s premier
neutrino experiment by upgrading the neutrino beam at FNAL and
constructing a 14-kt detector in MN, & a smaller 300-ton detector
at FNAL.  The $274M project will provide deep insight into the
fundamental processes involved in the formation of the universe &
understanding the differences between matter and antimatter.  The
project team effectively led a large number of partner
institutions to fabricate and assemble an immense number of
state-of-the-art technical components.  Ernest Moniz March 2015

*** ICARUS move to Fermilab described in press release
</H1> <P>
A Fermilab press release tells how this large liquid Argon Detector,
previously in Gran Sasso and now at CERN, will become part of the
Short-Baseline Neutrino Program at Fermilab.

*** NSAC meeting for nuclear physics planning in Kitty Hawk
</H1> <P>
A Long-range planning meeting in Kitty Hawk NC led to the drafting
of 4 recommendations, not yet available.  But for 0nu2beta, the
nuclear physics community is supportive of a ton scale program in
the next 10 years with a scale of $200M, and flexibility should be
there for more than one experiment; e.g. one U.S. led ton scale
experiment and participation in other experiments.  By Nov. the
NSAC Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay committee needs to evaluate
the R&D necessary and specific milestones needed to make a down
select.

*** Quenching and 0nu-2beta lifetimes
</H1> <P>
Matrix element calculations assume g_A=1.269.  But it's known from
single beta-decay and from 2nu-2beta that g_A is renormalized in
nuclei.  From measurements, it could be 0.5 to 0.8.  It appears to
2nd order in NME and 4th order in 0nu-2beta rates.  It is possible
the rate limits we have now should be multiplied by 6-34, making
ton scale experiments insensitive to the hierarchical inverted MH.
