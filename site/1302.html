*** NOvA Far Detector sees first light
</H1> <P>
Several blocks have been constructed; A kiloton of detector is
full of scintillator. Some has now been instrumented & read out.
Steve Magill is now shift coordinator and shifts will start soon.
A radio story on NOvA is available from Minnesota Public Radio.

*** Daya Bay II approved
</H1> <P>
In February 2013, Daya Bay II was approved by the Chinese government.
This is roughly equivalent to CD1 in the US.  It will be a large
detector requiring good energy resolution to measure the wiggles
in the oscillation spectrum and sensitive to the mass hierarchy.

<H1>
*** KEK roadmap includes Hyper-K
</H1> <P>
Hyper-K was recommended by Japan's HEP future projects committee
last year.  The Science Council of Japan will soon update the
Master Plan for large scale projects for all fields of science.
Hyper-K will be resubmitted March 2013.  The Master Plan is
expected to be an important input for the Japanese government.
The next Hyper-K working group meeting will be 21-22 Jun in Tokyo.

*** New CERN experiment, ICARUS & NESSiE at CENF.
</H1> <P>
A 6x6x6m^3 LAGUNA LAr prototype will be built at CERN in a 
new neutrino beam in the north area. Actually
several components are forseeen in the newly-named CENF 
(CErn Neutrino Facility).
While LAGUNA LAr prototype will be housed in the 
near site (460 m from the target), a two site experiment will
be setup in the near site and in a far site 
(1600 m away form the target) for neutrino sterile search.
The system is done by coupling LAr and Muon Spectrometer detectors. 
ICARUS moved from Gran Sasso will be used
in the far LAr detector and a cloned 150 ton 
Liquid Argon Detector in the near site.
Two Spectrometers a' la OPERA together with a new magnet 
conception for very low momentum muon measurement
 will be placed behind the LAr's.
p.s. Of course there have previously been many CERN Nu Facilities.

<H1>
*** Cosmology results on neutrinos, so far and next month
</H1> <P>
The number of (effective) neutrinos and the sum of the nu masses
are parameters with sensitivity from current and future cosmology
experiments.  See

A new better result is expected from Planck by the end of March.

<H1>
*** Neutrino Parking
</H1> <P>
SLAC is a small lab, so when the neutrino and cosmic groups
for Snowmass both met there at the same time, it created a
parking issue.  But as always, the neutrino physicists split
up.  Some parked in the near lot, some in the far lot.

<H1>
*** International Symposium on Underground Physics 24-27 May
</H1> <P>
This meeting's goal is to discuss the motivation for large
underground nu experiments in a global context.  A particular
goal will be to find a plan/money/way to build LBNE at Homestake
underground rather than on the surface.  Other additions to the
neutrino meetings page include: ANT13 conference on Advances in
Neutrino Technology at Davis in May, NNN13 in Tokyo in November,
a symposium in honor of the centennial of the birth of Bruno
Pontecorvo in  Pisa in September, and WIN2013 in Brazil in Sep.

*** Neutrino sessions at APS meeting
</H1> <P>
There will be a special symposium on neutrino interactions
that will be held at APS this April in Denver.

*** New York Times discusses the future of US particle physics
</H1> <P>
Several issues on the future of particle physics are described in
this 4 March article from the New York Times.  It mentions the
Higgs (featured on 5 March), LBNE, and has a provocative last
sentence with an opinion that the ILC would be a dinosaur.

*** More SNOWMASS white papers
</H1> <P>
The Snowmass 2013 Community Summer Study organizers are soliciting
white papers for the electronic proceedings.

If you previously submitted a Neutrino Oscillation whitepaper, the
Nu1 conveners have been circulating a set of metrics, posted at

*** Padma Bhushan for Jogesh Chandra Pati
</H1> <P>
India makes annual awards to scientists, artists and Bollywooders.
Stanford's Pati's interests include neutrino oscillation and
nucleon decay.  Padma Bhushan is the 2nd highest award in India.
