*** Search for an excess of electron neutrinos in MicroBooNE
</h1> <p>

They didn't find an excess.  A usual interpretation of the
MiniBooNE excess is the appearance in a nu-mu beam of nu-e due to
oscillations involving sterile neutrinos.  At a special 2-hour
Fermilab seminar, MicroBooNE presented three analyses, comparing
the predicted electron neutrino spectrum in the Booster Beam with
one that accounts for the MiniBooNE low Energy excess (LEE).  All
three strongly favored the no-LEE choice.

The prediction was 29.0 +- 5.2(stat) +- 1.9(syst) events.  There
were 25 events observed, and in the eLEE model another 11.6 events
would be expected.  See

The prediction was 86.8 +- 8.8 +- 11.5 nue events with protons and
no pions and 64 were seen.  Also 30 +- 5.6 +- 4.3 with no protons
or pions and 34 were seen.  See

There were
56 candidates compared to an expectation of  69.6 +-8.0(stat) +-
5.0(sys) without an excess and 103.8 +- 9.0 stat) +- 7.4(sys) if
the MiniBooNE low-energy excess was nue's.

This analysis uses Wire-Cell, which is a 3D event reconstruction
package which they have developed for liquid argon time projection
chambers.  It is described in

These analyses
will be stepping stones for DUNE, SBND and ICARUS.

*** IUPAP neutrino panel white paper released
</h1> <p>
The IUPAP report was perceived by some in the community as another
roadmap, but the mandate did not ask for a prioritization of
projects.  It was rather to consider the scientific opportunities
that international cooperation in neutrino physics may afford.
It aims primarily at demonstrating that neutrinos are very special
particles with unique features and many exciting opportunities.

FNAL physicist Regina Rameika is the 2022 W.K.H. Panofsky Prize in
experimental particle physics recipient.  She led the design of
the NuMI beam, helped discover the tau neutrino, served as project
manager of MicroBooNE, and is co-spokesman of DUNE.  T2K physicist
S. Bolognesi won the summer 2021 EPS Emmy Noether Distinction for
Women in Physics.

*** Are you smarter than a dark matter physicist?
</h1> <p>
I would think by most measures, nu and DM physicists should both
be smart.  I've told people one of my goals was to do a blind
analysis of the background for Dark Matter falling into a black
hole.  That must not be too smart.  Dark Matter questions high-
lighted the game-show like event sponsored by Sanford facility.
