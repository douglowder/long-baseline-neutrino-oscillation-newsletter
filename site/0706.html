*** Borexino Starts search for neutrinos
</H1> <P>
Borexino, a large tank of liquid scintillator at the Gran Sasso
Laboratory in Italy, finished replacing the water in its tank 
with scintillator on May 15th.  As of May 16, the first run
for solar neutrinos
with the full detector has begun.

*** SciBooNE starts search for anti-neutrinos
</H1> <P>
SciBooNE, a calorimeter upstream of MiniBooNE in the 8 GeV FNAL
neutrino beam, started taking data on May 30th.  This is ahead
of their original construction schedule.  The 8 GeV beam is
currently tuned for antineutrinos.  It may go back to 
neutrinos after the end of August.
Their goal is cross sections.

<H1>
*** ICARUS installed in tank at Gran Sasso in Italy
</H1> <P>
ICARUS T600 consists of two 300 ton cryostats which will be filled 
with liquid argon in the CNGS beam at the Gran Sasso.  The 2 tanks 
were recently put into a larger cooling vessel which holds both 
tanks in preparation for filling with liquid argon later in 2007.
One of the tanks operated previously at Pavia.  Filling should be 
complete for the CNGS beam which may start May 1, 2008.

*** For Fermilab, in Lieu of the ILC; neutrinos
</H1> <P>
What should Fermilab do if the ILC in its future is more "future" 
than anything else?  A steering committee is investigating
Fermilab's "intermediate" future, and neutrinos are a big part of 
the planning.  Six of 16 "one page proposals" involved neutrino
experiments, and two more involve large proton decay detectors
which also serve as neutrino detectors.  The two proton decay
ideas are UNO, a multi-cubical water Cerenkov detector
60x60x180 m^3, and an unnamed 500-1000 kton water Cerenkov
detector at Homestake DUSEL.

*** One melodic idea for Fermilab - NuSONG
</H1> <P>
NuSONG, one of the 1-page Fermilab ideas, stands for Neutrino 
Scattering On Glass.   Its main purpose is the study of 
neutrino-electron scattering.  The plan is to use a beam which 
is similar to NuTeV, but with higher rate, and a detector 
inspired by Charm II, but with more segmentation and tonnage.

*** Wes Smart's Blackboard
</H1> <P>
What happens to a neutrino physicists' blackboard when he/she 
retires?  In one case, it gets recorded on a digital camera
and put in the note repository.

*** Neutrino quote from the Fermilab User's Meeting
</H1> <P>
Robin Staffin "A neutrino from the NSF is the same as a 
neutrino from the DOE."

<H1>
*** Neutrino quote from the Gran Sasso
</H1> <P>
Carlo Rubbia "When we built the Gran Sasso, we saw the tunnel
was an asset.  Now we see the tunnel as a liability"

<H1>
*** New LNGS2 site for MODULaR Lab
</H1> <P>
Italy/INFN is looking at a new laboratory for housing a large
(20 kton) liquid argon detector.  The lab would be off-axis
of the CNGS beam, not in the National Park or water table,
or tunnel.
Sites on both sides of mountain are being considered, with
an excavation costing 50-60 M Euro.  


<H1>
*** MODULaR Detector Physics Goals
</H1> <P>
A new CNGS detector could compete with T2K and NOvA if built in
4 years.  The baseline is the same as NOvA and meson production
scales with the beam energy - 400 GeV.  Compared to NOvA and
T2K, neutral current backgrounds to nu-e appearance could be
significantly reduced, but intrinsic nu-e would be similar.

<H1>
*** Future CNGS beam possibilities
</H1> <P>
Key to future CNGS neutrino experiments is the possibility to
upgrade beam from the SPS for higher neutrino fluxes.  During
some of the time, the LHC will certainly have priority.  An
analysis of cycle time, beam sharing, power limitations and
possible new hardware can be found in CERN AB-2007-013(PAF) &

<H1>
*** Extrusion success for NOvA neutrino experiment
</H1> <P>
The planned off-axis long-baseline experiment in Minnesota using
the NuMI beam will use horizontal and vertical plastic extrusions
filled with liquid scintillator.  These 15.5 m long walls have to
be highly reflective.  The vertical walls will be thicker to 
provide structural support. Recent tests at Extrutech Plastics 
Inc. in Wisconsin successfully made thick-walled verticals and 
thin-walled horizontals using the same custom PVC formula.

*** $200M search for almost nothing
