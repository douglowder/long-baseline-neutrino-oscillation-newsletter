<p></p><h1>
*** NESTOR Institute Created
</h1>A Hellenic Republic Presidential Decree signed Aug.  6 has created
the "NESTOR Institute for Deep Sea Research, Technology and
Neutrino Astroparticle Physics". This is the first time that a
National Laboratory has been created with the specific goal for
High Energy Neutrino Astronomy.  Lab Director L. Resvanis invites
anyone who is interested to come to Pylos and try out their ideas
(which might very well be orthogonal to their preconceptions).


<p></p><h1>
*** Muon storage ring possibilities
</h1>People at CERN and elsewhere are considering muon storage rings
to produce neutrino beams for oscillation studies.  While the
rings have an attraction for studying electron neutrinos (half of
the neutrinos will be nu-e's and they will be tagged by sign, see
Cline's paper below), they are not better suited for studies of
numu to nutau oscillations than traditional horn-focused pion
beams with a decay pipe, despite some claims to the contrary.
Muon collider proponents would like to start with some
intermediate facility, and neutrino physics is a plausible
additional reason that can be used as an excuse, but be careful
because some overblown claims are being made.

<p></p><h1>
*** Neutrino Oscillation Length Resonance in Earth's Core?
</h1>Enhanced oscillations for particular parameters at small mixing
would affect the interpretation of the results of the
Super-Kamiokande experiment.  Not MSW. (See below-Petcov).

<p></p><h1>
*** NuMI review
</h1>This year's budget passed by Congress includes $14M in a line
item for the Fermilab neutrino program, but during this next week
there will be a "Lehman review" to determine if the project is
ready to spend the money.  This is standard now for all big US
projects.   One hint about Fermilab's future is that J. Dorfan
who was originally to be on the committee dropped off since he is
a rumored candidate for Fermilab Director.

<p></p><h1>
*** A review of the review for NuMI
</h1>At the request of congress, the National Research Council issued
a report in February 1998 on the need for independent project
reviews in the US DOE.  They chose NuMI and the Oak Ridge
Spallation Neutron source to get "external independent reviews to
focus on technical scope, proposed technologies, estimated
life-cycle costs, schedules, underlying assumptions and supporting
data, and the management, acquisition strategy, and reporting
system effectiveness."  After NuMI's Lehman review on election
day, this review, which will be done by EG&amp;G, will commence.

<p></p><h1>
*** Neutrino election
</h1>Neutrino issues are not on the ballot as the United States gets
ready to vote, but in a seminar by Barger at Fermilab last month
entitled "The Nu Revolution", the hundreds of people there were
asked, "Do you think neutrino mass is established?"  About two
people raised their hand.  "Do you think that neutrino mass is not
established?"  Another two people raised their hand.  Bob Dole
once spoke about a poll on whether ignorance or apathy was the
greater problem.  The answer was "I don't know and I don't care."

<p></p><h1>
*** Main Injector circulates beam;  Intensity for NuMI updated
</h1>The Main Injector has circulated, but not yet accelerated any
beam.  The MINOS experiment was approved based on 3.7 10^20
protons per year.  Some CERN comparisons have assumed that the
intensity will be (much) lower than this.  Fermilab management
has just updated its realistic estimate of how many protons will
be available for NuMI, and it's 3.7 10^20 per year.

<p></p><h1>
*** JHF moves from Tsukuba to  Tsuchiura
</h1>A new site has been proposed for the JHF, a 50 GeV hadron machine
in Japan to be coupled with a spallation neutron source.  This
means that if it is to be used for a long-baseline neutrino
experiment, a new beamline will have to be built.  But it also
helps the schedule for K2K.  Earlier, K2K was going to have to
pause while the PS was converted into an JHF injector.

<p></p><h1>
*** FNAL neutrino exhibit
</h1>There will be a Special FNAL Director's Coffee Break on Friday,
November 13, 1998 at 3:30 p.m. in the 1-East Gallery to mark
the opening of a Neutrino Exhibit.  Superman will be there.
