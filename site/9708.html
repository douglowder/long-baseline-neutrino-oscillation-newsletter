*** SuperK 306.3 days of solar neutrinos
</h1>They report a flux of 2.44 +-.06 +.05-.09 10^6/cm^2 s flux above
6.5 MeV.  BP95 Standard Solar model is 6.62.  Ratio = 0.37. An
E-plot shows an intriguing hint at a spectral distortion.  But a
nickel source sets the energy scale, and electrons from a LINAC
are used for systematic error.  They are moving towards using
the LINAC for calibration.  At present, the energy scale is not
completely understood.  No day/night effect is seen;  D-N/D+N =
0.017 +- 0.026+-0.017.

<p> </p><h1>
*** SuperK 300 days of atmospheric neutrinos
</h1>Contained - 718 e-data, 735 mu, 583.8 e-MC, 957.7 mu-MC for
R=0.635 +- 0.033(stat) +- 0.010(stat-MC) +- 0.052(syst).  For
Multi-Gev - 149 e, 139 mu, 120.4 emc, 184.2 mumc, 156 partially
contained mu, 210.6 partially contained mu-MC.  In mu-data/mu-MC
versus zenith angle there appears a clear distortion. e/e-MC
appears symmetric (up versus down) in zenith angle.  An
oscillation analysis gives the allowed region at high mixing from
delta m-squared from 10^-2 to 2 times 10^-4 eV^2.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Be careful about low delta msquared
</h1>The new SuperK best fit is at lower m than previous atmospheric
neutrino hints, but long-baseline experiments should think hard
before rushing to move their detectors an order of magnitude
further away.   When hypothesis testing, the case for an
atmospheric neutrino anomaly is quite strong.  When parameter
fitting, the errors are still large, and (my opinion)  more results
probably still favor 10^-2 over 10^-3.   That said,
it would be imprudent NOT to use the new Super-K best fit
(1.2 10^-3) as one planning point.  So expect to hear lots of talk
about low delta m^2 but don't take it TOO seriously.

*** Berezinksy wishes neutrinos physicists a long life
</h1>In a Durban highlight talk on neutrinos, V. Berezinsky said
"For 30 years we thought nus would give us information about deep
in the sun.  We now see helioseismology does it better."  He
pointed out that observational signatures for new neutrino
physics would be the energy spectrum in SuperK, the NC/CC ratio
in SNO and time variation in Borexino.  But he cautioned that the
experiments were hard and he didn't see a clear solution emerging
anytime soon. "Maybe the youngest in the audience will see the
solution, but they should be careful about their health."

*** MINOS to be built in two stages
</h1>The Fermilab PAC and Director have established a funding profile
for NuMI/MINOS with a total project cost of $120M over FY99,0,1,
and 02.  The MINOS detector will have a 40% contingency in its
first phase, a frozen detector design which will provide the
basis for a line item in the Congressional Budget, leaving open
the possibility that changes could be made to the design of the
second phase in response to new information.

<p> </p><h1>
*** OMNIS proposal for supernova detector
</h1>A new proposal for a supernova detector was described in a recent
article in Science Magazine.  OMNIS (Observatory for Multiflavor
NeutrInos from Supernovae) would look for neutrons from the 2000
muon and tau neutrino interactions of a galactic type II
supernova, in a salt deposit nuclear waste dump in Carlsbad New
Mexico and another at the Boulby Slat Mine in the UK.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Atmospheric mu+/mu- ratio
</h1>At Durban ICRC, two new results on the high altitude low energy
mu+/mu- ratio seem in conflict.  MASS gets 1.2 +- 0.05 XXX
HEAT measured 1.64 +- 0.08.  Atmospheric neutrino flux generators
prefer the lower value.  A 5% change in mu+/mu- would change
the denominator in the atmospheric neutrino flavor ratio by 1%,
(due to the lower antineutrino cross section).  The MASS data was
taken on the day of a Forbush decrease.  Stanev showed that the
Bartol Monte Carlo accounts for much but not all of the mu data.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Progress in Neutrino Telescopes, Amanda/Antares/Baikal/Nestor
</h1>AMANDA B, the 10 string detector at 1500-1900 meters has been
completed, and they have a neutrino candidate.  There is no
indication of bubbles.  21 string Amanda 2 is funded and will
start in 98-99 and finish 99-2000.  Antares is planning 300
optical modules on 3 strings 2400 m deep near Toulen France.
One string will be deployed in 1998.  Baikal has 144 of
192 PMT's in NT200 deployed.  They have 3 upward neutrino
candidates and 2 horizontal candidates.  In 4 10^6 downward
muon Monte Carlo, they reconstruct 21% with no fakes from
below, and 20% efficiency for neutrinos.  For Nestor, which
deployed two floors at 2500 meters, construction is going on and
they are evaluating the schedule for deployment.
