*** ProtoDUNE filling underway
</h1> <p>
Having installed the Anode and Cathode Plane Assemblies (APA/CPA)
and field cages, the protoDUNE Single-Phase detector at CERN has
been closed in July.  Then it was purged with gas.  Now the
filling with liquid Argon is underway and is expected to be
completed during the month of August.  Then beam.

Neytrino? They mixed alphabets.  But the pictures are great.

*** PIP II gets CD1 for go-ahead to MW power for LBNF
</h1> <p>
The DOE approved FNAL to design more powerful beams that will be
useful for LBNF and DUNE, replacing the LINAC for more proton power.

*** Interim DUNE TDR available
</h1> <p>
An interim Technical Design Report for the Deep Underground
Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) Far Detector has been completed. Vol. 1
(<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10334"> arXiv:1807.10334 </a>)
covers the physics, technology and strategies.
Vol. 2 (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10327"> arXiv:1807.10327 </a>)
describes the single-phase module's
subsystems, the technical coordination required for its design,
construction, installation, and integration, and its
organizational structure. Vol. 3 (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10340"> arXiv:1807.10340 </a>)
covers the
dual-phase module.  The full TDR is to be published in 2019.

*** IceCube neutrino apparently comes from Blazar
</h1> <p>
As reported in Science magazine, a high-energy neutrino event from
IceCube on 22 Sep 2017 called IceCube-170922A was coincident in
direction and time with a gamma-ray flare from TXS 0506+056 which
is a blazar seen by many astrophysical experiments.  The most
probable neutrino energy is 290 TeV and is &gt;183 TeV at 90% CL.
Earlier data also shows an excess of nus from that direction.

*** The History of neutrinos workshop 5-7 Sep in Paris
</h1> <p>
The Conference will cover the main steps of neutrino history since
the brilliant &amp; inspired idea of Pauli in Dec 1930. Though trying
to cover all the facets of this fascinating particle, it should be
considered as a contribution to the history since some chapters
are still to be written. The objective is to have a historical
approach and follow as close as possible the original papers in
correlation with the scientific and historical context.

*** NuSTEC Workshop 11-13 October at Gran Sasso
</h1> <p>
The NuSTEC Workshop on Shallow- and Deep-Inelastic Scattering
will take place 11-13 Oct at the Gran Sasso Science Institute, in
L.Aquila Italy right before NuInt18 nu-nucleus scattering workshop,
This NuSTEC workshop will concentrate on the theoretical treatment
and experimental results within the hadronic mass kinematic region
from just above the Delta resonance through the transition to DIS.

*** Walk the length of the proposed DUNE neutrino beam
</h1> <p>
From 1 Aug to 12 Sep, teams of people will use pedometers to count
their steps with a total goal of 1,600 miles, twice the distance
from Lead SD to Batavia, Ill. as the nu flies.  Most LBNF nus will
fly off into space, but some start at FNAL, &amp; end at Sanford Lab.
