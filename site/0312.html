*** APS Neutrino Study
</h1>
A hastily convened workshop attracted over 100 participants to 
kick off the study on the future of neutrino projects in 
December.  Six working groups were established to write reports, 
and input is solicited from the entire neutrino community.  The
Groups and Leaders are:
<br>
1. Solar and atmospheric nu experiments - J. Bahcall & J. Klein
<br>
2. Reactor neutrino experiments - G. Barenboim & E. Blucher
<br>
3. Superbeam experiments/development - W. Marciano & D. Michael
<br>
4. Neutrino factory and beta beam experiments and development -
   S. Geer & M. Zisman
<br>
5. Neutrinoless double beta decay and direct searches for neutrino 
   mass - S. Elliott & P. Vogel
<br>
6. What cosmology/astrophysics and neutrino physics can teach each 
   other - S. Barwick & J. Beacom

*** Monbusho Switzerland Washington Matter Effects
</h1>
The NSF's Michael Turner reminded the neutrino study that we are 
not operating in a vacuum, (real-world, matter effects).  There 
is a large federal investment in HEP and other projects are 
waiting to be funded.  Science is now viewed from a global 
perspective (duplication -; cooperation +).  Neutrinos are shared by 
nuclear and high-energy at DOE.  The DOE & NSF have never had 
better relations.  To quote Jack Marburger, "there are other 
fields with exciting opportunities too.  There's a deficit.

*** JPARCnu approved again
</h1>
Reversing an earlier setback, the Japanese cabinet agreed in 
December to approve the neutrino program (JPARCnu) starting next 
fiscal year.  The decision is based on the recommendation from 
the November review on J-PARC.  The input from the International 
Advisory committee, which labeled the neutrino program the #1 
priority, was very important.  The final official decision will 
be made at the end of March at the House level.  The total cost 
for the neutrino program is 16 billion Yen.  Thus, the total 
budget for J-PARC is now increased from 135 billion Yen to 
151 billion Yen.  The first-year budget (JFY04) for neutrino
is 0.6 billion Yen, and the total construction period is 5 years.

*** ANITA Launch
</h1>
ANITA (ANtarctic Impulse Transient Array) is a new Balloon-Borne HE 
Nu Detector.  A mission (TIGER) launched from Antarctica's McMurdo 
base 16-dec-03 was successfully brought down near Mawson base 
4-jan-04 after an 18 day flight.  On board, the ANITA team flew a 
small prototype instrument, ANITA-LITE, to understand more about 
the radio background in Antarctica and begin a search for the 
highest energy neutrinos known. The goal of the ANITA experiment 
is to listen for sharp bursts of radio waves emitted when a 
high-energy cosmic-ray neutrino interacts within the ice.

*** What Shape is Ice-Cube?
</h1>
Physicists from any of the eleven institutions in the big ten are 
not allowed to answer this question.  IceCube is a 1 km^3 high
-energy neutrino observatory being built and installed in the 
clear deep ice below the South Pole Station.  There will be 4980 
PMT's on 80 strings in a project more hexagonal than square.  The 
startup phase has been approved by the National Science Board and 
funds allocated to start in 04/05.  Full construction at 16 
strings per year will take 6 years.  Each hole in the ice is .5$M.

Origin (NOON2004) will be held at Tokyo, Japan, Feb 11-15, 2004.
This is the fifth workshop of this series.  Meeting links can be

*** Aspen Neutrino Workshop in summer, deadline 1 Feb.
</h1>
An Aspen workshop will be held June 28-July 18 on "Lepton number 
violation: Neutrinos, Leptogenesis, Grand Unified Theories and 
Beyond".  Application deadline is February 1st.

<p> <h1>
*** NuINT04 at Gran Sasso in March
</h1>
The third meeting of the NuInt series of international workshops 
on Neutrino-Nucleus Interactions in the Few-GeV Region (NuInt04) 
will take place Mar 17-21, 04 at the INFN Gran Sasso Laboratory.

*** Fermilab reacts to neutrino presentations
</h1>
The Dec. FNAL Physics Advisory Committee meeting was heavy on nus:

Program-Planning link </a>
The Off-Axis experiment and short-baseline Minerva projects were
given encouragement, while Finesse wasn't.

*** Its no small matter
</h1>
A reporter spends time at FNAL looking for sterile neutrinos.  See:

*** Was he looking for neutrinos?
</h1>
On December 24th, Fermilab security arrested an individual at the 
MINOS construction site, who was initially denied access to the 
lab site. He was found inside one of the Minos trailers.  
The individual was taken to Kane County lockup.  No neutrinos 
have been reported missing since neutrino mass was discovered.
