</p><h1>*** Gran Sasso Long Baseline Workshop</h1>
The workshop at Gran Sasso Italy on November 9th and 10th will
feature talks by Carlo Rubbia on ICARUS and Alan Ball on beam
design.  Descriptions of RICH, NOE, MACRO, LVD, Borexino, NESTOR
and MINOS are scheduled.  For information, contact 39575::GRILLO

</p><h1>*** Neutrino Beam Workshop December 4 and 5</h1>
A two day workshop on neutrino beams is being organized at Nevis
Laboratory to discuss conventional and novel beam designs.
For information, contact Yunsil Ho;  

<p>
</p><h1>*** TALLINN WORKSHOP</h1>
The CHORUS experiment reported progress at this neutrino workshop
in Estonia.  The beam efficiency has been 80% compared to an
estimated 50% in their 1993 proposal.  The vertex location is
about 180 micron resolution transversely and longitudinally.
Their current efficiency to match vertices between the emulsion
and electronic trackers is "80% and improving".  The Nagoya group
did not receive approval to scan the the second run, but new scan
stations in Italy and Turkey make it no problem.  CHORUS and
COSMOS have different estimates for backgrounds from direct nu_tau
production in the dump.  The last day of the workshop, the
Estonian government collapsed.

</p><h1>*** grammar of l-o-n-g-b-a-s-e-l-i-n-e</h1>
Both the world and this newsletter are often inconsistent about
the adjective for our field.  Should it be longbaseline,
long-baseline or long baseline?   Or long base-line,
longbase-line or long base line?  Anyone with
an opinion on this issue is urged to reply before November 24th.

</p><h1>*** What really matters?</h1>
Next weeks colloquium at the University of Minnesota was
originally listed in the calendar as a talk by Dr. David Caldwell
from the University of California at Santa Barbara on "Neutrino
Oscillations and the Fate of the University"
