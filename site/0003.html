*** Neutrino Factory Study looks at long-baseline
</h1>Draft reports from the Physics group and the Design study group
for a Neutrino Factory at Fermilab have been written, and can be
viewed from
<a href="http://www.fnal.gov/projects/muon_collider/index.html">
http://www.fnal.gov/projects/muon_collider/index.html </a>.

Sections of the physics document describe the beam properties,
oscillation physics, and non-oscillation physics.  It is the nue
component in the nu-factory that drives the oscillation physics
program.  A nue beam would a)enable basic tests of the
oscillation framework, b) search for nue to nutau, c) determine
the pattern of nu masses, d) check the MSW effect, e) measure or
limit all mixing angles and f) measure or limit CP violation.

<h1>
*** The sign of delta m^2
</h1>Delta m^2 = m1^2 - m2^2 could be positive or negative.  Most
oscillation experiments can't tell, but matter effects depend on
the sign.  Barger et al (below) explore the parameters and exper-
iments needed at a nu factory to sort out the mass hierarchy.

<h1>
*** The sine of delta m^2
</h1>Early results from K2K seem to show a big effect.  They would get
the biggest effect for delta m^2 near 8 10^-3 eV^2, but
statistical errors cannot presently pin down delta m^2 well.  On
the low side, the size of the effect falls off as (del m^2)^2.

<h1>
*** The sighing of delta m^2
</h1>The Kamiokande and Super-K "allowed" regions for neutrino
parameters do not seem to overlap much in delta m^2.  Many people
find this curious, but a large amount of physicist intuition is
based on the behavior of gaussian distributions.  If atmo del m^2
fits were Gaussian, it would be curious.  But
atmospheric fits come from L/E distributions which are quite
non-Gaussian.

<h1>
*** MINOS scintillator contract
</h1>This will go to Itasca, and is somewhat below the baseline cost.
Recent scintillator output looks good and light output exceeds
the "standard candle" which was early Quick Plastics samples.

<h1>
*** June 12 Meeting on Next Generation Underground Facility (WIPP)
</h1>The US Department of Energy (DOE) operates the Waste Isolation
Pilot Plant (WIPP) near Carlsbad, New Mexico as the nation's first
deep geologic repository for permanent disposal of defense-related
transuranic waste.   With an estimated 35-year operating lifetime
and with very low primordial background radiation, WIPP may be
used for experiments that require shielding from cosmic rays
greater than about 2000 m.w.e.   A Carlsbad workshop June 12-14
will consider possibilities. See

*** proceedings and slides

<a href="http://www.hep.anl.gov/mcg/ndk/hypertext/numeetings.html">
http://www.hep.anl.gov/mcg/ndk/hypertext/numeetings.html, </a>
the nu
meetings web page contains links to conferences.  After they are
over it includes links to transparencies and proceedings, when
available.  A new entry is the Workshop on Simulation and
Analysis Methods for Large Nu Telescopes, Zeuten '98.

<h1>
*** No confidence
</h1>Many transparencies from two workshops on confidence levels are
available.  D'Agostini
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-ex/0002055"> hep-ex/0002055 </a>.
proposes that we remove
"confidence levels" and "confidence intervals" from our parlance.

*** Long-Baseline News Links
</h1>This newsletter has a (self-imposed) 100 +-10 line limit for text
based mail, so I often shorten links.  To get full links with a
browser, click on the web page at the bottom.  Or you may want to
switch to the web version of the newsletter.  You get a short
message with the URL of the web index.  Preprints are linked to
xxx.  The mirror (Europe) shows up in under 24 hours.  To switch,

a mail message "switch2web".  Also "unsubscribe" anytime.
