This is the second of a planned series of approximately
monthly newsletters on the progress of P822 and the Fermilab
Long Baseline Neutrino Oscillation effort.  If you have
gotten this, you are on an initial distribution list and
will get one more unsolicited issue.  In order to remain on the

please tell me your preferred address.
Input and corrections for the newsletter are also welcome.

The Long Baseline Workshop Proceedings have been
distributed.  If you didn't get your copy, please contact

<h1>ASPEN PAC MEETING</h1>
Some preliminary rumors indicate they gave planning for
the neutrino program at Fermilab a high priority

<h1>Presentation to Main Injector Project Management Group</h1>
On June 11th, Steve Werkema presented the extraction
work that has been designed for Soudan to the Main Injector
Project Management Group.   Attendees included John Peoples,
Steve Holmes and Anthony Mravca.  The talk's main purpose
was a proof of principle that a viable solution existed for
getting the beam out of the Main Injector in the direction
of Minnesota.  The solution involved extraction at MI60 and
getting the beam out of the main injector tunnel near MI62.
No major conflicts were seen by anyone.
There was also some discussion of environmental
and aesthetic issues.  It was considered a major disadvantage
that the experimental hall will be visible from Pine Street.
The merits of the roller coaster beam versus pointing the
proton beam down from MI62 were briefly discussed, as was
the issue of where the Main Injector responsibility for the
beamline ends and where the research division begins.

<h1>Gallex result.</h1>
Here are the results Kirsten from GALLEX gave at
Neutrino 92:  83 +- 19 +- 8 SNU from 17 events.  SSM
prediction 132 SNU--- pp contribution 74 SNU. So the
result is compatible with SSM to 2 sigma. Two small regions
are still allowed for MSW. 10**-5 to 3 x 10**-6 for small
mixing angle and 10**-4 to 10**-6 for large.
Bahcall gave a talk. His number for Cl is now 8.0+-3.0.
He says that believers can still believe whatever they
believed in before. The biggest source of error is in the
8B calculation. Turck-Chieze gives 6.4+-1.4 and 124 SNU
for gallium, whereas Bahcall gives 132 SNU.

<h1>No 17 keV neutrino from Friedman(ANL,29 May)</h1>
Perkins(Oxford, 22 May) and Shirai(KEK, 12 June), as well as
overall indications at Neutrino 92 and the same impression from
Particle Astrophysics meeting at Blois France.

<h1>The Main Injector was funded by the house at only $15 Million</h1>
Same as last year, and certainly less than the 3 year funding
scenario.   If the Senate votes the President's budget of
$30 Million, a reasonable expectation is $23 Million for
Fiscal 93.  This, of course, has been overshadowed by the
House vote to cancel the SSC project, and appropriate
$34 Million to dismantle the project.
