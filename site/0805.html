*** CNGS long-baseline neutrino beam ready to start again.
</h1> <p>
The OPERA experiment in the Gran Sasso is 95% installed, and the
CNGS beam is scheduled to start on 11 Jun 08 &amp; run until 11 Nov 08
with 4e13 protons per cycle, and expecting 1.2 tau neutrinos
candidates in their emulsion.

*** P5 US panel Neutrino recommendations.
</h1> <p>
They recommend the 10-year content of the US HEP program under
several budget assumptions, and nus are central to future US HEP.
"The panel recommends a world-class neutrino program as a core
component of the US program, with the long-term vision of a large
detector in the proposed DUSEL laboratory and a high-intensity
neutrino source at Fermilab.  The panel further recommends that
in any funding scenario considered by the panel Fermilab proceed
with the upgrade of the present proton source by about a factor of
2-700 kilowatts to allow for an extended physics reach using the
current beamline and a timely start for the neutrino program in
the Homestake mine.  The panel recommends support for a vigorous
R&amp;D program on liquid argon detectors and water Cerenkov detectors
in any funding scenario considered by the panel. The panel
recommends designing the detector in a fashion that allows an
evolving capability to measure neutrino oscillations and to search
for proton decays and supernovae neutrinos.  In all but the lowest
funding scenario, the panel recommends a rapid NOvA construction
start. However, the lowest funding scenario would further delay
the experiment's construction start, and the costs of NOvA
construction and operation would displace other programs of higher
priority. The panel therefore recommends that Fermilab not proceed
with the NOvA experiment under the lowest funding scenario.  The
reactor experiments, Double Chooz and Daya Bay, are designed to
carry out measurements of the mixing angle theta13, an important
physics parameter. The panel recommends support for these
experiments under any of the funding scenarios considered by the
panel.  Non-accelerator experiments searching for neutrinoless
double beta decay have the potential to make discoveries of major
importance about the fundamental nature of neutrinos. The panel
recommends support for these experiments, in coordination with
other agencies, under any funding scenario considered..."

*** Jumping 192 meters or going underground
</h1> <p>
The tallest structure in the Southern hemisphere is the Auckland
Sky-Tower, where you can jump out (with a cable attached) and go
down the 192 meters at 83 km/hr.
<a href="http://www.skyjump.co.nz/">

Neutrino physicists are more likely to go underground, and
progress in new underground sites is continuing, such as DUSEL in
South Dakota, SNOlab in Canada, INO in India.

*** 192 days of Borexino - solar neutrinos
</h1> <p>
After cuts with a fit to the energy spectrum, Borexino measures a
counting rate of 49 +-3 +-4 counts per day (cpd) per 100 ton.
Major backgrounds determined by separate energy fits are:
210Bi 20+-2 cpd/100t, 85Kr 29+-4 cpd/100t, 11C 24+-1 cpd/100t.
For 7Be, they expect 75+-4 if no oscillations, &amp; 48+-4 if LMA-MSW.

*** Super-Kamiokande III has 192 days of "low radon" data
</h1> <p>
Super-K III, running with 11,129 phototubes since 2006.  The
threshold for solar neutrinos has been reduced to 5 MeV for 191.7
days of reduced radon.  They would still like to observe the
predicted upturn at low energy and a day-night asymmetry.
Installation of new DAQ electronics for "Super-K IV" will start in
Aug 08, then 6 months of commissioning before the T2K beam starts.

</p><h1>
*** Daya Bay making detectors with 192 phototubes
</h1> <p>
Eight identical cylindrical detectors will be built for measuring
reactor neutrinos from the 4 present and 2 future nuclear reactors
near Daya Bay China.  Each detector will have 192 tubes on the
sides.  Surprisingly to some at Nu2008, there will be no tubes at
the top and bottom, where there will be reflectors instead.
Simulations say the uniformity of such a design is good enough.

*** MINOS uses planes with 192 scintillator strips; has new Dm^2
</h1> <p>
The 5.6 kton detector uses strips that are 4 cm wide and up to 8 m
long in its far detector. It well-measures numu charged current
events 735 km away, and also some ability to measure nue's.  A new
analysis of 3.36e20 protons on target gives a best fit at maximal
mixing and Delta m^2 = 2.43 10^-3 eV^2 +- 0.13.  Compared to
oscillations, decay is disfavored @ 3.7 sigma &amp; decoherence @ 5.7.

*** Neutrinos and Pizza and Beer at Neutrino 2008 in New Zealand
</h1> <p>
New Zealand, one of 192 members of the United Nations, is pretty
far from the other members.  300 physicists showed up, but many
had to "give a talk" to justify the long trip.  So Neutrino 2008
scheduled short 3 minute talks to go along with the poster
sessions, and provided Pizza and Beer as an inducement to stay and
listen.  Despite worries about such a program, it worked well, and
helped to motivate the poster sessions.  With 109 posters/short
talks, 70 scheduled talks, and 13 breaks, there were 192
opportunities to learn about neutrinos at Neutrino 2008.

*** 192=200 phototubes at Baikal Nu telescope; Antares complete
</h1> <p>
For many years, the underwater detector at Baikal ran with
192 optical modules on 8 strings, but it was misnamed NT200.
They have run recently with 3 outriggers, changed the name to
NT200+ and increased the enclosed volume to 5 Mton.  The
Antares detector in the Mediterranean completed installation
and hookup in May 2008.  Ice-Cube at the South Pole has
incorporated AMANDA and is now 50% complete.

*** Would ET phone home with neutrinos or photons?
</h1> <p>
Neutrinos are the preferable carrier for galactic communication.
