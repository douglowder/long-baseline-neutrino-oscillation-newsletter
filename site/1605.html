*** ICFA neutrino panel report
</H1> <P>

http://icfa.fnal.gov/panels/neutrino_panel/  </A>
A Roadmap for the
international accelerator-based neutrino program has been prepared
by the neutrino panel of the International Committee on Future
Accelerators.  They provide 16 recommendations including that both
DUNE and Hyper-K be pursued through established approval and
funding processes.  They have identified two "decision-points",
at ~2020, to decide the future sterile and nu-scattering programs.

*** Neutrino 2016, Neutrino summer School and NuFACT16
</H1> <P>
Many experiments are polishing their new results for the London
Neutrino Conference 4-9 Jul.: 
<A href="http://neutrino2016.iopconfs.org/"> 
http://neutrino2016.iopconfs.org/.

The Neutrino Summer School 17-29 Jul seeks to train the next
generation of nu physicists:

At NuFACT, also in Vietnam, the implications of new results will
be considered for the worldwide neutrino program, including
implications for scattering, accelerator physics, oscillations,
mu physics and beyond PMNS:

*** Nishikawa and Nakamura get Totsuka prize, J. Friedman gets one
</H1> <P>
Koichiro Nishikawa and Kenzo Nakamura were awarded the 7th Yoji
Totsuka prize for the verification of accelerator neutrino
oscillation from the atmospheric neutrino oscillation in
Super-Kamiokande, and their leadership of the K2K experiment.

And Jerry Friedman who was on my first neutrino experiment, E594,
won the "Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun" Award.

*** New result - Double Chooz has a high value of theta13
</H1> <P>
At Moriond Double Chooz presented its first theta13 measurement
exploiting the combination of 2 years of single-detector data
(since 2011) and 9 months of double-detector data (since Jan 15).
The measured value for sin^2(2theta13) is (0.111+/-0.018), which
is about 35% larger (1.6 sigma) than the most precise Daya Bay
(0.082+/-0.004).

*** Lariat progress and prospects
</H1> <P>
LArIAT (Liquid Argon TPC In A Testbeam)doesn't observe nus, but
is useful for argon experiments. The collaboration has recently
reported preliminary results on the first total pion-Ar cross
section measurement. LArIAT is designed for calibrating detector
response in a charged particle beam in the energy range relevant
to both Short-(microBooNE, SBND, ICARUS) and Long-Baseline(DUNE).

<H1>
*** CAPTAIN MINERvA prospects at Fermilab.
</H1> <P>
CAPTAIN MINERvA plans to measure neutrino cross-sections
and event signatures on argon in the resonance production and
DIS cross-over regions with high statistics and good hadronic
containment.  After receiving stage one approval last summer,
the team was planning to seek stage two approval at this
month's FNAL PAC meeting.  The FNAL director recently indicated
he will not accept a proposal from CAPTAIN MINERvA due to a
lack of funding model.  The collaboration has petitioned to allow
them to seek funds and return for stage 2 approval.

<H1>
*** Three million Prospects for PROSPECT
</H1> <P>

The Precision Oscillation and Spectrum Experiment PROSPECT will
study the spectrum of reactor neutrinos 10 m from a core at the
Oak Ridge High Flux Isotope Reactor.  It was awarded $3M by DOE
to determine if the difference in reactor measured/predicted
rates has an energy dependence indicative of sterile nu models.

<H1>
*** ANNIE Phase I Running, Funded for Year 1
</H1> <P>
The Accelerator Neutrino Neutron Interaction Experiment (ANNIE)
has been awarded year 1 funding from the DOE through its
Intermediate Neutrino Program. ANNIE is a new effort underway in
the SciBooNE hall at Fermilab. It is designed to study the
production of final state neutrons from neutrino nucleus
interactions. ANNIE will also serve as the first implementation of
Large Area Picosecond Photodetectors (LAPPDs) in a neutrino beam.
Phase I of ANNIE, a measurement of beam induced background
neutrons, is now installed in the hall and taking data.

** NOvA returns to power with recycler; needs to replace target
</H1> <P>
NuMI was able to return at full intensity three weeks after the
transformer fire reported last month.  After exceeding its expected
lifetime, the NOvA target MET-01 has a probable helium leak.  The
graphite target core would oxidize in oxygen at high temperature
sometime during its lifetime, so the target is kept in a helium
atmosphere.  This target will be replaced during the summer
shutdown.  Before the shutdown, the goal is to demonstrate 700 kW
operation and then run three weeks with antineutrinos
(~0.4e20 pot) by switching the horn polarity.
