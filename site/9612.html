<p> </p><h1>
*** SuperKamiokande results
</h1>With 101.9 day exposure, they measure flux = 2.51 +.14 -.13 +-
.18 x 10^6, Evis &gt; 7 MeV.  (Their previous result was 2.80 +- .19
+- .33 for E&gt;7.5 MeV.)  They have a one sigma day/night effect.
They have 1000 atmospheric neutrinos,  but they're not ready to
announce a result.  They measure their water transparency at
79 +-4 m using a laser, and 56 +- 2 m with a Radon source.
Expect a paper on solar neutrinos in the spring.

*** Long-baseline plans in Italy
</h1>There was an INFN meeting (following the Frascati workshop) to
prepare the new five-year INFN research plan in which the
long-baseline project from CERN to Gran Sasso was viewed very
favorably.  Various groups in Italy are continuing to consider
detector designs.

*** CHORUS and NOMAD results due in January
</h1>Preliminary NOMAD and CHORUS results will be presented at the
SPSLC in January.   Meanwhile, NOMAD has done a search for
neutrino decay to check the KARMEN anomaly.  They have seven
events, consistent with background, and can rule out some, but
not all of the parameter space suggested by KARMEN.  See
the thesis of David Steele listed below.

*** Supernova Neutrinos don't oscillate
</h1>This isn't new, but its new to me.  Standard oscillation analyses
assume plane waves, but wavepackets are involved.  If the mass
eigenstates spread out further than the size of the wavepacket,
there is mixing but no oscillations.  (I had previously thought
of these synonymously, but of course they are not.)  For
accelerator, solar and reactor neutrinos, the plane wave
approximation is usually ok, but it isn't for supernova neutrinos.
This is covered in chapters 9 and 17 of Kim and Pevsner's book
"Neutrinos in Physics and Astrophysics".

*** How to make money on neutrinos
</h1>The Tuesday December 3 Issue of the New York Times had a summary
of neutrino experiments around the world in the Science Times
section.  It includes a quote from Don Perkins, "you can
generally make money by betting against the success of neutrino
experiments."  The  article covers the demise of DUMAND, the
progress of NESTOR, AMANDA, SuperK, and long-baseline projects at
KEK, Fermilab and CERN.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Caveat
</h1>Long-baseline news is a rumor sheet.  Statements and facts
presented here should not be quoted but are made available so
that interested persons can follow up information they might be
interested in.   Input, references and corrections are always
welcome.

<p> </p><h1>
*** If neutrinos have mass, what do I tell my father?
</h1>Neutrino enthusiast Peter Rosen is the new Associate Director
for Nuclear and High Energy Physics at the DOE.  Energy
Secretary Designate Federico Pena has no known feelings about
neutrinos, but he was named Father of the Year by the National
Father's Day committee in 1995.
