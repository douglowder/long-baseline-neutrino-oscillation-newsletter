*** Hyper-Kamiokande with a detector in Korea
</H1> <P>
It's been considered before, but the appeal of a second detector
at 1100-1300 km baseline from J-PARC is again being studied now
that theta13 is known.  The range of OA angle in Korea is 1 to 3
degree, in which there are many mountains over 1 km high.  A
detailed look at this configuration is available in "Physics
Potentials with the Second Hyper-Kamiokande Detector in Korea" by
the Hyper-Kamiokande proto collaboration.

*** NOvA overheats due to a snowstorm
</H1> <P>
Due to a heavy snow on 18 November, the lab at Ash River Minnesota
lost power.  After power was restored, the temperature in the
computer room got too high and triggered an overhead sprinkler.
There was water throughout the computer room, but the detector was
not affected.  Far detector data was interrupted for about a week,
but due to heroic efforts from the lab crew and others, data
acquisition at the far detector has now resumed.

*** Need a list of Neutrino Experiments?
</H1> <P>
INSPIRE has updated its "List of Experiments" and there are
55 neutrino experiments on that list.  In alphabetical order:

*** Neutrino pioneer MGK Menon, 1928-2016
</H1> <P>
The former director of TIFR (the Tata Institute of Fundamental
Research), Professor Menon set up the deep underground physics
laboratory at the Kolar Gold mine, the world's deepest.  Last
year was the 50th anniversary of the first reported atmospheric
neutrino from KGF.  The laboratory was also used to search for
nucleon decay, magnetic monopoles and for cosmic ray muon studies.

*** Ross Shaft at Homestake Mine
</H1> <P>
The rehabilitation of the Ross Shaft at the Sanford Underground
Research Facility is almost done.  Started in 2013, they have
removed the old steel and installed new, while cleaning out
decades of debris.  So far 4269 feet of shaft have been
fixed, with 900
to go; using 6 million pounds of steel and almost 50,000 rock
bolts.  Completion is scheduled September 2017.

*** Solar non-oscillations 2
</H1> <P>
Last month long-baseline news mentioned a reference that pointed out
that the adiabatic crossing in solar neutrinos wasn't oscillatory.
That paper was motivated by a couple of words in the Nobel prize
citation, and wasn't meant to be groundbreaking.  Previous works
on this subject include Nunokawa et al., "What fraction of boron-8
neutrinos arrive as a nu(2) mass eigenstate?"

*** Neutrino Marketing
</H1> <P>
On Cyber Monday, I offered subscriptions to this newsletter for 
free.  Of course it is always free, but I got no new subscribers
that day.  If you know anyone who should subscribe, tell them
to contact me or visit the web page below.  Of course, you may
also cancel a subscription at any time.
