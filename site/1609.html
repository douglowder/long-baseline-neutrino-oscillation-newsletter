*** LBNF/DUNE reaches CD3a milestone
</h1> <p>
The Department of Energy has formally approved CD3a, which
enables construction at Sanford Lab in South Dakota of the first
two large underground caverns.  One cavern would fit the first
DUNE detectors and the second would house the cryogenic systems
and other utilities.  Funding is included in the President's
budget, and is working its way through the house and senate.

*** Neutrinos from PIon Beam Line, nuPIL
</h1> <p>
A conventional neutrino beam consists of a proton beam hitting
a target followed by one or more magnetic horns.  An alternative
option for LBNF has been developed based on a sign-selected wide
acceptance (transverse and in momentum) pion beam line.  A design
was made using a 200 meter straight section with 27 quadrupole
magnets based on work from NuSTORM.  Possible advantages over the
LBNF baseline design is the much lower wrong sign components, most
of the Kaons would decay in the bend, the hill is not needed, and
beamline instrumentation could better constrain the flux.

*** LBNF/DUNE evaluates NuPIL

The NuPIL idea was
presented at the last DUNE collaboration meeting, and has been
evaluated by the Experiment-Facility Interface Group (EFIG).  In
order to concentrate efforts on preparing a TDR for the beam by
June 2019, it has been decided not to pursue NuPIL or other
alternative studies to the optimized LBNF wide-band beam design.

*** LBNF/DUNE supported by Illinois and South Dakota
</h1> <p>
Two Lieutenant Governors, Matt Michels from South Dakota and
Evelyn Sanguinetti from Illinois got together to issue a joint
declaration of support for the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility and
Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment.

*** Ice-Cube sees no evidence for sterile neutrinos
</h1> <p>
A global fit to explain the short-baseline anomalies gets
dmsq = 1 eV^2 and sin^2(2q_24) = 0.1.  These sterile nus would
produce distinctive energy-dependent distortions of the measured
zenith angle distributions in IceCube, cased by resonant matter-
enhanced oscillations during neutrino propagation in the Earth.
Using 20145 muons from 344 days, IceCube expects a large depletion
for the global 3+1 best fit point, dominated by the parametric
resonance.  The absence of this depletion allows them to exclude
that point at 99% CL.  See
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01990"> arXiv:1605.01990 </a>
(recently updated).

*** Ice-cube fails to resolve or explain short-baseline anomalies
</h1> <p>
Taking all data at face value, 3+1 sterile nus as an explanation
of the short-baseline anomalies has been ruled out for some time.
But what is the explanation?  It is probably not statistical
fluctuations.  It may be systematics or interesting new physics.
