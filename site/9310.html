</p><h1>822 Revised proposal and Progress Report</h1>
Extensive Monte Carlo work, made possible by Geoff
Pearce and undertaken by Hugh Gallagher has taken place
on the NC/CC ratio.  Using either scanning or an
algorithm on track length, the NC/CC confusion is under
10%, and correctable to under 2%.  Using the P803 Monte
Carlo, made possible by Steve Werkema, the electron
neutrino component (about 1%) has been studied.
A revised proposal and status report was submitted on
October 12th.

<h1>PAC</h1>
The PAC will hear from 822 on Friday 12 November from
10-10:30.  Other Friday morning presentations are on
P803 (Reay), Neutrino Beam options (Rameika) and E815
Status report (Shaevitz/Bernstein).

<h1>FES progress</h1>
A design of the NuMI beamline and conventional
facilities is near completion, and will be given to
Flour-Daniel, a consulting engineering firm, for a cost
estimate for digging as soon as the core samples from
the test bores are analyzed.  Part of the decay pipe
appears to be located in a 10 meter region of fractured
rock.  A rough cost estimate for the surface buildings,
enclosures and utilities is $7 Million.  It is still the
goal to have cost estimates and a draft Project
Definition Report by the PAC meeting.

<h1>803 thinking about proton west; pre-Main Injector.</h1>
The new 803 proposal, which was substantially redesigned
after dropping the bubble chamber magnet, will also be
presented.  Columbia and Michigan groups have
joined 803.  The proposal document considers two
locations for P803 in the Main Injector era; sharing the
P822 NuMI beam, and using a surface/near-surface beam
starting with protons from the Main Ring.  The PW8
experimental hall, located at the end of Proton West is
being investigated.   This would probably mean they give
up on NuMI.

<h1>Main Injector receives Key Decision 3</h1>
This important DOE decision allows the Main Injector
construction to proceed in earnest.  The current
(President's budget) schedule is something like
$25M 93-94;           $46M 94-95
$50M 95-96            $50M 96-97
$32M 97-98
which calls for completion the end of 98, but in reality
only $17M can be spent in the last year, so this may
mean completion is really in 99.  In light of the SSC's
defeat, a new funding schedule that completes the machine
in 97 will be sought.

<h1>Neutrino Workshop in Asilomar</h1>
A neutrino workshop was held in conjunction with the DNP
(Nuclear Physics) APS meeting.  It concentrated on solar
neutrinos, but also considered accelerator, atmospheric,
reactor and supernova neutrinos.  822 was given nice
coverage by L. Wolfenstein and Bill Louis.  All Solar
data still agrees with an MSW solution.
LSND has started taking data at LAMPF, and plans to run
for at least two years (no LAMPF shutdown is imminent).
In about one week of data, so far, they have 60 neutrino
charged current events off of Carbon.

<h1>822 collaboration meeting.</h1>
The collaboration meeting was held October 2nd in
Minneapolis.  It concentrated on preparing the document
for the PAC.  Use of the AP2 line was also considered.
