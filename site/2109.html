*** Single-photon production in MicroBooNE
</h1> <p>
MicroBooNE reported on their first test of the MiniBooNE Low-E
excess (LEE) with a search radiative decay of NC Deltas(1232), a
single photon with 1 or 0 protons and 0o charged leptons.   With
6e20 pot, they measure 27 1 gamma 1p events, consistent with the
expected signal of 5 and 21 background.  An enhanced signal by 3.2
could account for the MiniBooNE LEE.  With a 2-hypothesis test
(expected/enhanced rate), they reject enhancement at 94.8% CL.

Sabine Hossenfelder
discusses the short-baseline anomaly(ies) reported by LSND and
MiniBooNE.  It reminded me of my view of why physicists sometimes
disagree:  "If the data doesnâ€™t agree with the null hypothesis or
the alternative hypothesis, some say you need more data, while
some say you need more hypotheses."

*** Justin Evans elected MicroBooNE co-spokesperson
</h1> <p>
Professor Justin Evans from the University of Manchester was
elected to lead the FNAL MicroBooNE experiment with Yale's Bonnie
Fleming.  Stepping down is Fermilab's Sam Zeller, after 4 terms.

*** Chicago's 33rd Street becomes Leon Lederman Way
</h1> <p>
It joins Neutrino Drive in Murfreesboro TN, Enrico Fermi Court in
Warrenville IL, Enrico Fermi Drives in Newport MI and San Diego CA
and the town of Neytrino in Caucasus Mountains of Southern Russia
as locations of interest to the neutrino community.

*** Evidence the reactor antinu anomaly is from 235U flux
</h1> <p>
In
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01684"> arXiv:2103.01684, </a>
Kopeikin et al. measured e yields from 235U
which indicated the 30-y old data used to predict reactor nu
spectra are 5% high, in a way to almost eliminate the anomaly.
See sec. 2.5 of
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03934"> arXiv:2107.03934. </a>
The 5 MeV bump remains.

*** New results from BEST on Gallium anomaly in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11482"> arXiv:2109.11482 </a>
</h1> <p>
Another 51Cr test of the Gallium detectors at Baksan sees 20% fewer
events than predicted, but no difference between Ga volumes at two
average distances.  To fit sterile neutrinos, this requires large
mixing (sin^2(2q)~0.4) and high mass (Delta m^2 &gt; 1 eV^2).

As long as you don't have a live question (and most people don't),
it works almost as well.   But you'll also need the program:

*** NuTools Report available at

http://nutools.ornl.gov/
</a>
</h1> <p>
This report explores practical roles for nus in nuclear energy and
security.  It's the product of the Nu Tools study, commissioned in
2019 by the DOE's NNSA &amp; DNN R&amp;D.  Among a number of findings and
recommendations, it concluded that for most reactors under current
IAEA safeguards, the safeguards community is satisfied with the
existing toolset and does not see a specific role for neutrinos,
but that advanced reactors present novel safeguards challenges and
a case for possible use of neutrino monitoring.
