<h1>Long-Baseline news,  November 2004 </h1>

<p> <h1>
*** First 400 NuMI/MINOS pulses coming soon
</h1>More than half of NuMI's primary beam components are in the Main 
Injector/Recycler tunnel interlock system, where access 
opportunities will be very restrictive once intense beam starts.
Final efforts are still ongoing in the NuMI Target Hall, so beam 
tests will be limited.  NuMI will run in a target out mode 
starting 3-Dec, looking to transport the primary beam to the 
hadron absorber, with an intensity of a few E11 protons/pulse.
It will run for several shifts during the first two weekends of 
December using a repetition rate  < 1 pulse/3 minutes.

<p> <h1>
*** Delta M-squared 32 moving up again
</h1>The latest best fit for the square of the mass difference from 
K2K is 2.8 x 10**-3 eV**2 with an uncertainty +0.4, -0.7.
(see 
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0411038"> hep-ex/0411038).  </a>
This is good news for other long baseline 
experiments, such as MINOS, CNGS and Double-CHOOZ, compared to 
the previous best fit at 2.0.  

<p> <h1>
*** K2K horn fails; it might be the end of the run
</h1>K2K is the long-baseline experiment from KEK to Super-Kamiokande 
in Japan.  Their statement is "During the recent K2K data taking 
run, we experienced an apparent horn failure. At this moment, 
we do not know the cause and the extent of the damage due to 
high radiation near horn. We will soon make a decision on 
what we should do."  K2K Collaboration

*** APS Neutrino Study Context
</h1>The APS neutrino study report (
<a href="http://www.aps.org/neutrino"> http://www.aps.org/neutrino) </a>
made 
three recommendations in the context of certain assumptions about 
the groundwork for the new experimental program.  The assumptions 
include:  
<ul>
<li>
 Continuation and strong support of the existing program.
<li>
 Underground laboratory facilities.
<li>
 Determination of the neutrino reaction and production cross 
sections required for a precise understanding of 
neutrino-oscillation physics and the neutrino astronomy of 
astrophysical and cosmological sources.
<li>
 Research and development to assure the practical and timely 
realization of accelerator and detector technologies critical to 
the recommended program.
<li>
 International cooperation.
</ul>
Of particular interest are R&D efforts aimed toward development 
of a high-intensity proton driver, a neutrino factory, a very 
large neutrino detector, and techniques for detection of UHE nus.

*** Fermilab gets Potentially the Premier Peruvian Lab Director
</h1>Pier Oddone will be the new Director.  In a message to the FNAL
community, he says: "The laboratory is poised for a future that 
includes the premier experiment in flavor physics, potentially the 
premier program in neutrino physics, and strong participation in 
the LHC as it takes over the lead at the energy frontier."

*** How much does a pound of neutrinos weigh in California?
</h1>Physicists planning a theta_13 experiment at the Diablo Canyon 
Nuclear Power plant originally had good cooperation from the 
power plant operators, PG&E, but for whatever reason, the company 
changed its mind.  Articles critical of the company's decision 
recently appeared in 15-Nov LA Times and in San Francisco:

One quote to think about, "At one time, neutrinos were thought to 
be massless. It is now known they do have mass, but not in the 
sense that a kilogram of shrimp weighs 2.2 pounds."

<p> <h1>
*** R2D2
</h1>Its not Star Wars, and its not a robot.  Its the latest idea for 
measuring theta_13 at a nuclear reactor.  You need two or more 
reactors about a kilometer apart, so only Daya Bay and 
Kashiwazaki are the obvious candidates.

*** BENE workshop explores neutrinos in Europe
</h1>The Coordinated Accelerator Research in Europe meeting considered 
neutrino physics, among others.  www-mhf.desy.de/public/care04/
One view of the situation is that the LHC plus linear collider 
plans are eating up too much of the resources. The CERN 
management has recently made statements which do not exclude (as 
before) a neutrino future at CERN and some people consider this 
very encouraging. However skepticism is warranted since CERN will 
be busy with LHC for a number of years. DESY is pushing towards 
a LC and doesn't seem to some to have a plan B.

*** Totsuka wins award
</h1>Prof. Yoji Totsuka was awarded the Order of Culture, Japan's most 
prestigious honor in the fields of culture and science.

*** ARENA workshop on EEV neutrinos May 17-19 at DESY Zeuthen
</h1>The workshop will focus on high-E nus using radio or acoustic 
signals.  ARENA stands for "Acoustic and Radio EeV Neutrino 
detection Activities."

*** Is the neutrino the dark energy?
</h1>The fourth root of the cosmological constant is about the average 
neutrino mass.  Peccei considers a scenario proposed by Fardon, 
Nelson and Weiner where these facts are connected in "Neutrino 
Models of Dark Energy"
