<p> </p><h1>
*** First 400 NuMI/MINOS pulses coming soon
</h1>More than half of NuMI's primary beam components are in the Main
Injector/Recycler tunnel interlock system, where access
opportunities will be very restrictive once intense beam starts.
Final efforts are still ongoing in the NuMI Target Hall, so beam
tests will be limited.  NuMI will run in a target out mode
starting 3-Dec, looking to transport the primary beam to the
hadron absorber, with an intensity of a few E11 protons/pulse.
It will run for several shifts during the first two weekends of
December using a repetition rate  &lt; 1 pulse/3 minutes.

*** Delta M-squared 32 moving up again
</h1>The latest best fit for the square of the mass difference from
K2K is 2.8 x 10**-3 eV**2 with an uncertainty +0.4, -0.7.
(see
<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0411038"> hep-ex/0411038).  </a>
This is good news for other long baseline
experiments, such as MINOS, CNGS and Double-CHOOZ, compared to
the previous best fit at 2.0.

*** K2K horn fails; it might be the end of the run
</h1>K2K is the long-baseline experiment from KEK to Super-Kamiokande
in Japan.  Their statement is "During the recent K2K data taking
run, we experienced an apparent horn failure. At this moment,
we do not know the cause and the extent of the damage due to
high radiation near horn. We will soon make a decision on
what we should do."  K2K Collaboration

*** APS Neutrino Study Context
</h1>The APS neutrino study report (
<a href="http://www.aps.org/neutrino"> http://www.aps.org/neutrino) </a>
made
three recommendations in the context of certain assumptions about
the groundwork for the new experimental program.  The assumptions
include:
<ul>
<li>
Continuation and strong support of the existing program.
</li><li>
Underground laboratory facilities.
</li><li>
Determination of the neutrino reaction and production cross
sections required for a precise understanding of
neutrino-oscillation physics and the neutrino astronomy of
astrophysical and cosmological sources.
</li><li>
Research and development to assure the practical and timely
realization of accelerator and detector technologies critical to
the recommended program.
</li><li>
International cooperation.
</li></ul>
Of particular interest are R&amp;D efforts aimed toward development
of a high-intensity proton driver, a neutrino factory, a very
large neutrino detector, and techniques for detection of UHE nus.

*** Fermilab gets Potentially the Premier Peruvian Lab Director
</h1>Pier Oddone will be the new Director.  In a message to the FNAL
community, he says: "The laboratory is poised for a future that
includes the premier experiment in flavor physics, potentially the
premier program in neutrino physics, and strong participation in
the LHC as it takes over the lead at the energy frontier."

*** How much does a pound of neutrinos weigh in California?
</h1>Physicists planning a theta_13 experiment at the Diablo Canyon
Nuclear Power plant originally had good cooperation from the
power plant operators, PG&amp;E, but for whatever reason, the company
changed its mind.  Articles critical of the company's decision
recently appeared in 15-Nov LA Times and in San Francisco:

One quote to think about, "At one time, neutrinos were thought to
be massless. It is now known they do have mass, but not in the
sense that a kilogram of shrimp weighs 2.2 pounds."

*** R2D2
</h1>Its not Star Wars, and its not a robot.  Its the latest idea for
measuring theta_13 at a nuclear reactor.  You need two or more
reactors about a kilometer apart, so only Daya Bay and
Kashiwazaki are the obvious candidates.

*** BENE workshop explores neutrinos in Europe
</h1>The Coordinated Accelerator Research in Europe meeting considered
neutrino physics, among others.  www-mhf.desy.de/public/care04/
One view of the situation is that the LHC plus linear collider
plans are eating up too much of the resources. The CERN
management has recently made statements which do not exclude (as
before) a neutrino future at CERN and some people consider this
very encouraging. However skepticism is warranted since CERN will
be busy with LHC for a number of years. DESY is pushing towards
a LC and doesn't seem to some to have a plan B.

*** Totsuka wins award
</h1>Prof. Yoji Totsuka was awarded the Order of Culture, Japan's most
prestigious honor in the fields of culture and science.

*** ARENA workshop on EEV neutrinos May 17-19 at DESY Zeuthen
</h1>The workshop will focus on high-E nus using radio or acoustic
signals.  ARENA stands for "Acoustic and Radio EeV Neutrino
detection Activities."

*** Is the neutrino the dark energy?
</h1>The fourth root of the cosmological constant is about the average
neutrino mass.  Peccei considers a scenario proposed by Fardon,
Nelson and Weiner where these facts are connected in "Neutrino
Models of Dark Energy"
