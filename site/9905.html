<p> </p><h1>
*** K2K taking data
</h1>The first long-baseline neutrino experiment continues to take
data.   In a run ending in March they saw about 100k events in
the near detector. This allowed them to study the neutrino beam
relative to various beam monitors and horn current settings.
The direction of the neutrino beam has now been confirmed by the
front-detector profile.  Although they have seen 0 events in
Super-K, data from monitors and the front detector are being
analyzed to predict the expected number of events per proton.
They are taking more data in May-June before the summer shutdown.

<p> </p><h1>
*** CERN moving forward
</h1>While no formal action on long-baseline plans are expected at
CERN before December 99, NGS proponents in Europe (for a CERN to
Gran Sasso neutrino beam) expect strong encouragement from
meetings in June.   The US continues to urge collaboration.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Main Injector dedicated by big shots.
</h1>A governor (Ryan), energy secretary (Richardson), senator
(Fitzpatrick) and Speaker of the House (Hastert) all converged
at Fermilab June 1 to dedicate the Main Injector.  They each got
10^13 neutrinos to take home.

<p> </p><h1>
*** MINOS
</h1>NuMI/MINOS passed its second "Lehman" Review and received CD3B
approval, which allows authority to start constructing the beam at
Fermilab.  Meanwhile, the excavation contract for the new cavity
at Soudan was won by Lametti, a Minnesota firm.  Excavation will
start slowly during the tourist season.   The new NuMI project
manager at Fermilab is Dixon Bogert, replacing Tom Fields.

<p> </p><h1>
*** ICARUS
</h1>ICARUS is the only detector which is already "approved" to run in
the CERN to Gran Sasso beam.  They are building a 600 ton
detector and planning for the physics capabilities of a 30 kton
Super-Icarus.  A 10 m^3 prototype of the cryogenic and purity
systems was tested during February and March. All goals were
reached, in particular temperature uniformity (which affects the
tension on the wires), liquid Argon purity, and low noise.

<p> </p><h1>
*** DAEDALUS
</h1>The distances from CERN to Gran Sasso and Fermilab to Soudan are
both, coincidentally, 730 km. In their 730 km flight from Crete
to Sicily, Daedalus made it and Icarus did not.  Ikaria, where
Icarus reputedly tumbled into the sea, is only 250 km from Crete,
the same baseline as KEK to Super-Kamiokande.  Daedalus is a new
design for a 15 kt fine-grained liquid scintillator long-baseline
nu detector which relies on good identification of quasi-elastic
events.  See Doucet et al., below.

<p> </p><h1>
*** THESEUS
</h1>THE Second Experiment Underground at Soudan (THESEUS) is Soudan 2,
a fine-grained one kiloton tracking calorimeter which will be in
the NuMI-MINOS beam when it turns on.  It will be part of the
MINOS experiment, but is separate from the new MINOS magnetic
detector. Soudan 2 has operated as a nucleon decay and atmospheric
neutrino experiment for about ten years.   The designation THESEUS
distinguishes its MINOAN role as a long-baseline detector from
its non-accelerator function.

<p> </p><h1>
*** minoTAUr
</h1>Ok, people, we have the TAU staring us in the face.  Let's get
creative.  Meanwhile, see

<p> </p><h1>
*** New NOMAD Limit
</h1>NOMAD has improved its numu to nutau limit by a factor of 3.5
over previous published limits and almost a factor of two from
what was reported at Neutrino '98.  The data corresponds to
950,000 numu CC interactions, and they see no signal for nutaus,
setting a limit sin^2 2-theta&lt;1.2 10^-3 for delta-m^2&gt;1.0 eV^2.
