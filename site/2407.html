*** NuFACT 2024 in September at Argonne National Laboratory
</H1> <P>
Early Bird Registration ends on Friday 16 August.  Site access
permission can take time so prompt filling out of the form is
requested.  A limited number of registrants may sign up for a
tour of Fermilab.

*** Neutrino mass;  inverted mass ordering ruled out
</H1> <P>
Earlier I missed 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03002"> arXiv:2404.03002 </A>
in which DESI ruled out the inverted
order with Sum(m_nu) < 72 meV @95% CL.  
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18047"> arXiv:2407.18047 </A>
& 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06117"> arXiv:2407.06117
 </A>
discuss how adding CMB data the limit is Sum < 50 meV and is in
conflict with oscillations Sum > 60 meV.  
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13831"> arXiv:2407.13831
 </A>
considers
that the limit rules out IO and is at the edge of an NO conflict.
Negative masses are discussed in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07878"> arXiv:2407.07878, </A>
while 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02462"> arXiv:2407.02462 </A>,
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15640"> arXiv:2407.15640 
 </A>
& 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10965"> arXiv:2407.10965 </A>
show how dark matter and energy mimic it.

<H1>
*** ProtoDUNE Horizontal Drift cryostat filled and taking data
</H1> <P>
It was filled in Spring 2024 and has been taking cosmics in May &
beam in June.  The TPC and cold electronics are new. The HV system
has been redesigned, the Photon Detectors (X-Arapucas) and their
electronics are new, APAs are an evolution of the original design.
HV has ramped up to 180 kV (500 V/m) without problems and is very
stable.  Ar purity is excellent - e- life above 50 ms, exceeding
requirements.  The TPC trigger alerted DUNE to an upstream beam
halo tracks before the accelerator operators realized conditions
had changed.  First data with negative beam particles has been
taken and calibration systems have been commissioned.  NP02, the
vertical drift ProtoDUNE, will be filled for beam runs in 2025.

<H1>
*** Management advice from whistleblowers at Fermilab
</H1> <P>
A variety of disturbing incidents at Fermilab are related in this
document posted to 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13924"> arXiv:2407.13924. </A>
The common theme is the
management organization, FRA, which is currently out for bid.  My
observation is that management organizations, be it URA, FRA, or
an office of the University of Chicago are fairly irrelevant.  In
reading some of the stories, I concluded that too much emphasis is
put on privacy at the expense of effectiveness and accountability.
That thought involves society more than just physics entities. The
inappropriate focus on security is mentioned but not central.

<H1>
*** Long-Baseline infrastructure on The Infrastructure Show
</H1> <P>
A podcast focusing on Big Infrastructure for Big Science tells the
story of DUNE.  This podcast is sponsored by Northwestern
University.

<H1>
*** More Beam power at J-PARC
</H1> <P>
The neutrino facility achieved 800kW stable operation in June,
which exceed original design power of 750kW, and is a big step to 
realize 1.3 MW in beam power for the Hyper-Kamiokande project.
They also cooled and accelerated positive muons for the first time.

*** Naba Mondal to receive national science award "Vigyan Shri"
</H1> <P>
Awarded for his unwavering committment toward neutrino research in
India, he will receive the award on 23 August from the President
of India, Droupadi Murmu at her residence in New Delhi.

<H1>
*** DUNE spokesman Bishai named DOE distinguished Scientist Fellow
</H1> <P>
Mary Bishai, Brookhaven National Laboratory, honored for enduring
contributions at the intensity frontier of high energy physics in
unraveling fundamental properties of neutrinos; extraordinary
leadership and service to the particle physics community; and deep
commitment to broadening participation through mentoring next
generation scientists.

<H1>
*** Silver award for Sara Bolognesi
</H1> <P>
Dr. Sara Bolognesi at CEA/Universit√© Paris-Saclay was awarded the
2024 silver medal of the French National Centre for Scientific
Research (CNRS) in the field of nuclear and particle physics, for
contributions to T2K as analysis co-coordinator and in the
development and delivery of new near detectors.

<H1> *** Neutrino Jobs Updates - 12 new jobs listed for July </H1> <P>
