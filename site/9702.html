*** New DOE official pushes NuMI
</h1>Peter Rosen, the new Associate Director of High Energy and Nuclear
Physics at the DOE was interviewed for the January 24 issue of
Ferminews.  After mentioning that his own personal interest had
included work on neutrinos, he was quoted to say, "I'd like to see
the NuMI project proceed with 'all deliberate speed' as they say."

<p> </p><h1>
*** Palo Verde site complete</h1>
As of Feb 1, 1997, the low background laboratory at Palo Verde
has been completed.  The neutron shielding water tanks are in
place.  The detector is being installed during February and
March.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Chooz experiment waiting for neutrinos</h1>
The Chooz detector is together and has taken several background
runs, which look good.  They are now waiting for the reactor to
turn on.  This could be any day now, though past schedules for
reactor turn-on have not been reliable.

<p> </p><h1>
*** SNO progress</h1>
The upper half of SNO's vessel is completed and is now suspended
by ropes.  The lower half is now under construction.

<p> </p><h1>
*** APT chambers for MINOS in CDF test beam</h1>
Gas chambers for MINOS, now dubbed "Aluminum Proportional Tubes"
are being tested along with a Dubna electromagnetic calorimeter
with D0 plastic planes, at the CDF test beam.  Sharing the beam
with CDF, the Dubna tests are first.  In mid-March the 1 cubic
meter calorimeter, with up to 25 planes (1, 2 and 4 cm
segmentation) will be tested with positrons from 1 to 25 GeV.
Results on plastic versus aluminum, proportional mode versus
streamer mode and different gas mixtures will be obtained.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Why are pulsars moving?</h1>
The high peculiar velocities of pulsars (500 km/s) is a long
standing problem.  An anisotropic neutrino burst due to parity
violation in the direction of the magnetic field can explain the
velocities if m3 &gt; 100eV.  See the paper by Kusenko and Segre.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Intersections conference to include 4 neutrino sessions</h1>
The 6th Conference on the Intersections of Particle and Nuclear
Physics will be held May 27-June 2, 1997 in Big Sky, Montana.
There are four parallel sessions devoted to Neutrino and
Non-accelerator Physics;  organized around the topics
"Non-accelerator Physics," "Solar Neutrinos," "Atmospheric
and Cosmic Neutrinos," and "Neutrino Oscillation Experiments."
The conference website is http://phnxmu.lanl.gov/intersections/.

<p> </p><h1>
*** Neutrino's don't exist</h1>
According to Baurov (below) neutrinos don't exist.  But this
newsletter is about neutrinos.  This newsletter exists.
Therefore neutrinos do exist.

Neutrinos aren't neutrinos.  They're something else.  I hope
that's clear.
