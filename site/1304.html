*** Strategy for Neutrino theory meeting at Fermilab 20th of May
</h1> <p>
While the fraction of the US investment in experimental particle
physics allocated to the so-called Intensity Frontier - and
neutrino-related experiments in particular - continues to grow,
the US neutrino theory community remains at subcritical levels.
This imbalance will ultimately impact, perhaps severely, the
returns from the anticipated healthy investment in Intensity
Frontier research during this and the next decade.  These issues
will be discussed at a one-day FNAL no-talk no-fee meeting on
Monday 20 May.  Contact A. De Gouvea, A. Friedland, P. Huber.

*** MINOS global fit using beam and atmospheric neutrinos
</h1> <p>
With a combination of beam neutrinos and atmospheric neutrinos,
MINOS can measure a new and better value of Delta msquared_32,
for which it has the world's best measurement.  In
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1304.6335"> arXiv:1304.6335 </a>
the new best measurement is 2.41 x 10^-3 eV^2 + 0.09 - 0.10 with
sin^2(2 theta_23) = 0.950 + 0.035 - 0.036.

*** Ph.D. courses at Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI)
</h1> <p>
There is a new scientific center, run by the INFN in L'Aquila near
the Gran Sasso Lab. See
<a href="http://www.gssi.infn.it/index.php/en/"> http://www.gssi.infn.it/index.php/en/  </a>
It
has 4 courses, including Astroparticle Physics starting Oct 2013,
a rather specialized PhD, for experimentalists &amp; phenomenologists,
with courses in neutrino physics, gravitation and cosmology, dark
matter, nuclear physics and astrophysics, high energy astrophysics
etc.  See
<a href="http://www.gssi.infn.it/index.php/en/courses"> http://www.gssi.infn.it/index.php/en/courses.

*** CONNIE (COherent Neutrino Nucleus Interaction Experiment)
</h1> <p>
CONNIE is a multi-institution plan to use low noise CCDs to look
for coherent nu nucleus scattering.  Ten one-gram CCD targets were
built at Berkeley based on a design for the Dark Energy Survey,
assembled at Fermilab, and will be installed this June in a
trailer 30 m from the core of the Angra II reactor in Brazil.
They expect 1 event per 4 days with 0 background.  A large water
tank for monitoring the fuel in nuclear reactors will be installed
in the trailer ~November.  That project is known as Angra Nu.

</p><h1>
*** What LBNE is and isn't
</h1> <p>
The reconfiguration process left several different documents which
covered the physics reach of the Long-Baseline Neutrino Experiment
describing different programs.  The collaboration is clarifying that
LBNE is a plan for a 34 kiloton liquid Argon detector underground at
SURF with a fully capable near detector.  The first phase  which has
CD1, for a 10 kiloton detector without a near detector is to be
called LBNE10.  It is a high priority goal to be placed underground.

*** International Neutrino Summer School 20112(INSS13)
</h1> <p>
INSS13 will take place from 6-16 Aug at the Beijing Shunxin Green
Resort.  The school is co-hosted by IHEP and Fermilab and will
feature lectures &amp; student-led problem solving and presentations.
The school curriculum extends from "neutrinos in the Standard
Model" to Leptogenesis to detector and accelerator technologies.
The registration for the school is now open, and the deadline for
registering is May 15.

*** NOvA contingency
</h1> <p>
<a href="http://www.fnal.gov/pub/today/archive/archive_2013/today13-04-23.html">
http://www.fnal.gov/pub/today/archive/archive_2013/today13-04-23.html
</a>
In a director's corner, Pier Oddone reported that NOvA will be the
third project in a row that FNAL has completed on budget and on
schedule.  A previous concern that remaining contingency was
inadequate has been addressed.  More work has been completed,
nearly 14 percent contingency remains, and essentially all known
remaining construction risks are retired except the price of oil.

</p><h1>
*** ANU progress during Fermilab Shutdown
</h1> <p>
Work on the needed magnets, RF cavity and other equipment to
increase the power of the NuMI beam during the Fermilab shutdown
is progressing.  When the beam returns in June, they plan to
commission the Main Injector first at low power; 30 KW for 2 weeks
and 150 kW by June 15th, 300 kW by July 1 and 500 kW in 5 months,
using slip stacking in the Recycler.  NuMI can expect 5e20 protons
on target by July 2014, 1e21 by July 2015.

</p><h1>
*** T2K election
</h1> <p>
Takashi Kobayashi from KEK is the Spokesperson for the T2K (Tokai-
to-Kamiokande) long-baseline neutrino experiment.  Chang Kee Jung
was re-elected as the International Co-spokesperson for 2 years.

</p><h1>
*** ICFA neutrino panel
</h1> <p>
The International Committee for Future Accelerators has appointed
a panel to promote cooperation in the development of the
accelerator-based neutrino oscillation program.

*** Neutrino Symmetry Interest Group NuFunSym
</h1> <p>
An interest group on Neutrinos and Fundamental Symmetries is being
set up to promote a vibrant and sustained future for the study of
Neutrinos and Fundamental Symmetries as one of the core thrusts of
nuclear physics in the United States.  Register at
<a href="http://lansce.lanl.gov/adeps/NuFunSym.shtml"> http://lansce.anl.gov/adeps/NuFunSym.shtml

*** Why we went to the Intensity Frontier Workshop
</h1> <p>
Yuval Grossman started this Snowmass preparation workshop by
asking "Why are we here?" and answering it, "We are here to find
out why we are here."  He also made use of all the vowels in his
equation A + E + I = U .ne. O where A = Astrophysics, E = Energy,
I = Intensity, U = Unity and O = zero.
