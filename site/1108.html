*** MINOS antineutrinos now oscillate like neutrinos
</h1> <p>
In a previous now published analysis of 1.7e20 pot, MINOS saw an
antineutrino disappearance result which didn't overlap well in
parameter space with the neutrino result.  MINOS did the right
thing and pressed for more antineutrino running at NuMI.  With
1.2e20 additional pot, a careful new analysis shows that neutrinos
and antineutrinos are now consistent.  The previous result appears
to have been a fluctuation.  Currently, 273 antineutrino events
are expected with no oscillations, and 193 are seen, excluding
null-oscillations at 7.3 sigma.  The best fit is now to an
antineutrino delta msquared of 2.62 +0.31 -0.28 e-3 eV^2 and
square of twice the mixing angle &gt; 0.75 at 90% CL.  Neutrino
and antineutrino are consistent at 42% CL.  For details, see

*** Delta msquared goes down with new measurements?
</h1> <p>
It has been noticed (Kamioka-Super-K, Soudan 2, MINOS neutrino,
MINOS antineutrino) that early measurements of delta msquared are
often replaced by more accurate values that are lower.  Is this
just the fact that things are discovered with upward fluctuations?

*** Update on the Indian Neutrino Observatory (INO) project
</h1> <p>
INO involves the construction of an underground laboratory and
surface facilities near Pottipuram village in Tamil Nadu, and the
construction of a 50 kton magnetized Iron calorimeter (ICAL) to
study neutrinos, together with an INO center at Madurai and a
graduate training program.  ICAL uses Resistive Plate Chambers,
prototyped at TIFR in Mumbai.  It is scheduled for six years to
completion in 2017.  At the site, the environment and forest
clearances have been obtained, and formalities for transfer of 26
Hectares of land at Pottipuram and 12 Hectares at Madurai are
complete.  They are waiting for the transfer of land by the Tamil
Nadu Government.

*** DOE Intensity Frontier Workshop 30 Nov- 2 Dec in Rockville Md
</h1> <p>
A DOE sponsored workshop will take place at the Rockville Hilton
near DC on 30 November to 2 December.  It will examine the physics
program for High Energy Physics in the U.S. as facilities
transition from the energy frontier to the intensity frontier.
There will be at least five working groups; (nucleons, nuclei &amp;
atoms; heavy quarks; charged leptons; neutrinos; photons) and
organizers for neutrinos will include Kate Scholberg, Sam Zeller,
Andre De Gouvea and Kevin Pitts.  A goal is for the working groups
to get considerable work done before the workshop, so feel free
to contact these people to help.  A web page is imminent.

*** Where is the Higgs?
</h1> <p>
At the 2011 lepton photon meeting, the name of the local area
network for participants to check their email was "Higgs".  Other
than that, however, the Higgs was nowhere to be seen, with some
limits presented from ATLAS and CMS.  The CERN director argued
that the non-observation of the Higgs would be a discovery.  Hints
reported from earlier EPS meeting, didn't resolve themselves for
this non-collider physicist.  Would the lack of a Higgs mean that
the neutrino doesn't have a Dirac mass?  Of course not.  Whatever
is giving a Dirac mass to the other particles could do so for nus.

*** I believe a non-zero theta-13 has been seen by T2K and MINOS
</h1> <p>
As evidenced from the discussions at NuFACT, most experimental nu
physicists seem to believe that a value of theta_13 accessible to
the current and future round of experiments has been observed, and
are making their plans accordingly.  Some people, particularly
theorists, say this is "not good enough".  One example is Michael
Peskin, who gave the summary talk at Lepton-Photon, who argued
that the 3.2 sigma global fit did not meet his criterion of
"5 sigma discovery" often mentioned by collider physicists.
Fortunately, it doesn't affect experiment what Michael Peskin thinks and most
collider physicists don't believe their own rhetoric.  A 5.8 sigma
difference in CP parameters between neutral and charged B decays
wasn't called a "discovery", it was called a "puzzle".  A theorist
said "no-one should publish effects under 2 sigma".  My immediate
comeback was we should publish whatever we see, but I now wonder
about the following value of "x":  "No theorist should publish
anything unless there is an experimental effect of at least
x sigma."  My first observation is that x is zero, but I'm not
even sure that negative values are frowned upon.

*** Want to get in a debate about statistics?
</h1> <p>
Louis Lyons' book "Statistics for nuclear and particle physicists"
has the following quote after the title page, "The result of this
experiment was inconclusive, so we had to use statistics." Many
things that I've heard people say about statistics seems wrong to
me.  Upon reflection, this also applies to most things that I've
ever said about statistics.  Yet somehow as a discipline, we seem
to get things right, in the sense of taking seriously results that
turn out to be true, and being skeptical about results that are
not.  I've been involved in several discussions lately, and I've
summarized some of the points in a made-up discussion at lepton
photon 2011:

Involved in the Troitsk experiment, he was involved in setting
some limits on neutrino mass using Tritium decay.
