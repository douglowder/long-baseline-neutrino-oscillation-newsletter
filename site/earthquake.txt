Dear friends and colleagues,

As you already know, an earthquake has devastated the area 
around the town of L'Aquila, Italy, causing hundreds of 
deaths and making thousands of people homeless. The 
government is deploying all the possible resources for the 
rescue operations, but the situation is still extremely 
severe.  The epicenter of the shocks lays only a few km 
from the site of the Gran Sasso underground laboratory.
However, fortunately, the people and the equipment of the 
Laboratory did not suffer damage. All the running 
experiments are working smoothly, and the external 
buildings have been essentially untouched.  I thank you 
for the messages of solidarity and sympathy.  Anyone 
wishing the help the many homeless people of L'Aquila and 
surroundings can make a money transfer to the Bank 
CARISPAQ SPA, quoting as reason for the transfer: "Vittime 
terremoto L'Aquila"  
Iban code: IT 53 Z 06040 15400 000 000 155 762  
BIC/Swift code: BPMOIT22XXX.

With kind regards,


The Director of LNGS
Prof. Eugenio Coccia
