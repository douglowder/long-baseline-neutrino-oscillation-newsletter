Long-Baseline Neutrino News                   November 1997

***  CHOOZ result
</h1>
The Chooz neutrino oscillation reactor experiment sees no
evidence for a change in the neutrino energy spectrum.   The
measured nu rate 1.1 km from the reactors is 25.5 +- 1./day
The background is 1.1 +- 0.25 /day.  The ratio between measured
and expected flux is R = 0.98 +- 0.04 (stat) +- 0.04 (syst).
This pretty much rules out numu to nue as an explanation of the
atmospheric neutrino anomaly.  It also rules out the
Acker/Pakvasa solution and the maximal mixing solution with the
previous fit of delta m-squared.

***  LSND continues to have effect with Tungsten target
</h1>
Preliminary results from LSND with a Tungsten target continue
to show an excess of events consistent with numubar to nuebar
oscillation.  Previously they had used a segmented water target.
The excess from the 1996-97 data is 30.3 +- 14.8 and from all
data it is 82.8 +- 23.7 events, corresponding to P=.31%.

*** CHORUS takes last event
</h1>
After four years of operation the data acquisition for
CHORUS at CERN ended on Nov. 10, 1997.  The first event in
the emulsion was taken on May 5, 1994.

***  NESS:  Neutrinos at the European Spallation Source
</h1>
The European Spallation Source will exceed the neutrino intensity
of the ISIS facility by more than a factor of 60.  In conjunction
with a 1000 ton detector under the beam stop, the achievable
sensitivity for numbar to nuebar oscillation is 6 10^-5 in
mixing.  A link to NESS is now on the neutrino oscillation
industry page under short-baseline;

***  Long-baseline neutrino experiments at muon colliders
</h1>
Muon colliders with a straight section in the recirculating arm
are prodigious neutrino sources.  There will be measurable rates
from a hypothetical muon collider at any point on earth that one
could aim the beam.  For example, a 250 GeV muon beam could make
10^5 neutrino events per kiloton year at Gran Sasso.  Also, this
would be a good source of high energy electron neutrinos.

***  Neutrino Radiation at muon colliders
</h1>
Muon colliders will produce a high enough flux of neutrinos that
the muons that they create are a potential radiation concern.  A
muon collider put underground with 250 GeV muons which exits the
earth 10 km away leads to an annual dose at the surface which is
3% of the Fermilab limit, which itself is 1/10 the federal limit.
This is not a problem, but the dose increases as E^3, so muon
colliders much above 1 TeV would have to be prohibitively deep or
deal with this problem some other way.

*** NuMI project at Fermilab
</h1>
With a picture of the Soudan mine's Whitey on the cover,
Ferminews gave the NuMI project and neutrino physics some
prominence.  On October 13th, President Clinton signed the DOE
appropriations bill, which includes $5.5M for NuMI and makes it a
bona fide project.   Other proposals at Fermilab are now looking
towards the day when NuMI funding is over.  But the Main Injector
had a setback when they tested the cooling water lines and there
were major leaks.  Since the NuMI project near detector hall will
be the lowest point on the site, we will expect the leaks to be
fixed before neutrinos flow towards Soudan (or they'll be wet).
