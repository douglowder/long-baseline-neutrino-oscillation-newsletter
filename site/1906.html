*** new NOvA results
</H1> <P>
The NOvA experiment showed new results with a larger antineutrino
sample, based on 12.3e20 pot.  There is 4.4 sigma evidence for
nuebar appearance.  Combining with neutrinos, it measures dmsq_32
= 2.48 +0.11 -0.06 e-3 eV^2, sin^2(theta_23) = 0.56 +0.04 -0.03,
The data favors the normal mass order by 1.9 sigma and the upper
octant for theta_23 by 1.6 sigma.

*** Updated 2019 Particle Data Group values for neutrino mixing
</H1> <P>
Listings are updated annually.  In the 2019 version, there are new
values for theta_13, theta_23, delta & dmsq_32, while theta_12 and 
dmsq_21 are unchanged.  The new values are sin^2(q23)=0.536 +0.023 
-0.028; delta = 1.37 +0.18 -0.16 pi rad; sin^2(q13) = 0.0218
+- 0.0007 and dmsq_32 = 0.002444 +- 0.000034 eV^2.

*** Joint APPEC-ECFA-NuPPEC Seminar
</H1> <P>
This 1st Joint ECFA-NuPECC-APPEC Seminar (JENAS) jointly organized
by LAL, IPNO, IRFU and LPNHE will be held from 14-16 Oct in Orsay.
Profound explorations of both the smallest and largest structures
in the universe made possible breakthroughs in astroparticle,
nuclear and particle physics.

The
"Vietnam School on Neutrinos" will start soon 7-19 July.  The
school is organized by Japanese physicists, Neutrino Group, IFIRSE
& Rencontres du Vietnam, held at ICISE center, Quy Nhon. The
program contains lectures of particle physics, nu phenomenology,
detection methods & hardware (a prototype with scintillator and
MPPC) and software Super-K nu event id and generators.

*** NuFACT 2019 26-31 August in Daegu Korea
</H1> <P>
The 21st International Workshop on Neutrinos from Accelerators
will be held at the Grand Hotel in Daegu Korea in August. 
Registration is open 
<A href="http://nufact2019.knu.ac.kr/">
http://nufact2019.knu.ac.kr/  
</A>
There are five
working groups on 1. Oscillations, 2. Nu scattering, 3. Accelerator
Physics, 4.  Muon Physics and 5. Neutrinos beyond PMNS

*** Gaurang Bhaskar Yodh, 1928-2019
</H1> <P>
<A href="https://umdphysics.umd.edu/about-us/news/department-news/1470-gaurang-yodh-1928-2019.html">
https://umdphysics.umd.edu/about-us/news/department-news/1470-gaurang-yodh-1928-2019.html
</A>
Gaurang was a notable cosmic ray physicist, but among his many
accomplishments, he was a pioneer in using large neutrino detectors
for their ability, between beam spills, to measure characteristics
of ultra high energy cosmic ray air showers.

<H1>
*** URA graduate thesis award to Jacob Todd for MINOS+ analysis
</H1> <P>
<A href="https://news.fnal.gov/2019/06/jacob-todd-receives-ura-graduate-thesis-award-for-work-on-neutrino-data-analysis/">
https://news.fnal.gov/2019/06/jacob-todd-receives-ura-graduate-thesis-award-for-work-on-neutrino-data-analysis/
</A>
Todd details a method for analyzing data from neutrino experiments
in a way that removes bias present in traditional methods. It’s
the first time that the method has been applied for long-baseline
neutrino experiments — experiments in which two neutrino detectors
are separated by a great distance.

<H1>
*** Proposal to study tau neutrino production at CERN
</H1> <P>
In Aoki et al., 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03487"> arXiv:1906.03487 </A>,
 the DsTau collaboration aims to
use decays of D_s mesons produced in proton-nucleus interactions
and measure the cross section in emulsion.  A result would be a
more accurate tau neutrino flux from a nuclear target.

<H1>
*** Fewer Advisory Panels?
</H1> <P>
President Trump has ordered federal agencies to eliminate at least
one-third of their non-statutory advisory committees created under
the Federal Advisory Committee Act.   The High Energy Physics
Advisory Panel has been advising the government on the
construction of particle physics facilities since the 1960s and
oversees the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5)
process, which establishes a nationwide strategic direction for
the field.  P5 has scheduled an update.

<H1>
*** First CAPTAIN Scientific Publication
</H1> <P>
CAPTAIN's first scientific paper has been accepted for publication
by PRL.  It is the first measurement of the neutron cross section
on Ar from 100-800 MeV.  The results are from the neutron running
using the Mini-CAPTAIN detector at WNR.
