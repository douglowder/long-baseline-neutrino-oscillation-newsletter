*** Daya Bay gets its 1,000,000th neutrino interaction
</H1> <P>
The latest Daya Bay paper for the measurement of theta_13 is based
on 300,000 nu interactions.  Data taken now exceeds a million.
The paper gave sin^2(2 q13) = 0.090 + 0.008 - 0.009, Delta m^2 =
2.59 + .19 - .20 10^-3 eV^2, with chi^2/DOF = 167.7/153.  They are
preparing a paper on the nu flux to test the reactor anomaly, and
another one on the shape of the reactor neutrino E distribution.
They note that the measurement of Dm^2 using MeV nus at 1 km from
the reactor matches MINOS' value using GeV nus 730 km from the
source.  The 3 nu paradigm works pretty well.

*** NOvA installs module number 10,000
</H1> <P>
Just after completing block 25 (of 28), NOvA installed its
10,000th module at the (rather cold this week) facility in Ash
River Minnesota.

The final pieces for the near detector are at Fermilab, and the
module manufacturer has finished its last NOvA extrusion.

And Fermilab has slip-stacked its first beam into the recycler.

*** LBNE simulates 1000 cosmic ray events for 35 ton prototype
</H1> <P>
Simulating and reconstructing events in liquid argon is
challenging due to the huge information content.  LBNE, led by
Alan Hahn, is making a 35 ton liquid argon prototype detector.
They have cooled down the cryostat and achieved good purity
levels in the gas. They have transfered liquid to the cryostat,
Next is to test the pumps and start liquid purification.

*** 28 Events in Ice-cube
</H1> <P>
<A

http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2013/dec/13/cosmic-neutrinos-named-physics-world-2013-breakthrough-of-the-year
</A>
The 28 events seen in Ice-Cube with energies above that expected
for so many from atmospheric neutrinos (background 10.6 events)
was named Physics World breakthrough of the year, for making the
first observations of high-energy cosmic neutrinos.  This is a
vast improvement over last year's selection of nu communication.

<H1>
*** 28 Events in T2K
</H1> <P>
With 6.6e20 pot delivered, T2K has observed 28 events consistent
with numu to nue oscillations.  With reactor results, they
disfavor positive values of delta for the normal hierarchy.
They plan to double power to about 400 kW in 2014 and 750 kW by
2018 (depending on funding).  Full planned statistics is based
on 78e20 pot by 2020.  A possible anti-nu run is being discussed.

<H1>
*** Minerva Cross section experiment
</H1> <P>
A main goal of Minerva is to measure nu cross sections off a
variety of nuclei (C, Fe, Pb, H2O, Ar).  Knowledge of the flux
will limit the accuracy.  Uncertainties now range between 15-20%
for 1-20 GeV.  They have a multiprong approach to improve this in
the NuMI beam.  This includes adding a 4th muon monitor, special
runs that vary the beam parameters such as horn current & target
position, use of the nu-electron interactions, the low nu method
(PRD 81 072002, 2010), and the use of external hadron production
data, such as NA61.  The goal is to reduce the uncertainty < 10%.

<H1>
*** Fermilab proposes Proton Improvement Plan II (PIP-II)
</H1> <P>
At the BNL P5 meeting, Fermilab presented PIP-II for improvements
to the accelerator complex aimed at providing a beam power of at
least 1 MW on target at the start of LBNE.  This plan is embedded
within a longer-term concept for a sustained campaign of upgrades
& improvements to achieve multi-MW, continuous wave capabilities.

*** What is PIP-I?
</H1> <P>
PIP is a series of upgrades to FNAL's Linac & Booster to support
physics for the next decade, including NOvA.  It demands a rate of
p production more than twice that previously delivered, but the
machines cannot withstand any worsened radiological conditions.
Furthermore, much of the accelerator equipment is original or has
unavailable replacement parts.  PIP will modernize the complex by
updating many obsolete and unavailable systems, enhancing the beam
and loss control systems, and refurbishing many components to
withstand the higher repetition rate.  The key metrics for the p
source are to be able to deliver 4.3e12 p at 15 Hz (2.3e17 p/hr)
with > 85% availability and no greater radio-activation within or
near the accelerators. For comparison, NOvA alone at 700 kW would
consume 1.6e17 p/hr, and the best the Booster has ever provided is
1.1e17 p/hr - still 10x its historical rate.  The next major
limiting process is refurbishment of the Booster's 19 main RF
cavities during accelerator operation. The present plan is to have
beam available at 15 Hz in < 2y, full intensity beam ~1y later.
