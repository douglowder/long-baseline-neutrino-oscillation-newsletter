measurement system and from inside the detector during filling:

is a
video from Shoji Nagamiya, Director of J-PARC, describing the
effects of the Eastern Japan Earthquake.  They plan to finish the
recovery and resume operations by December 2011.  More details are

*** Recovery from the fire for MINOS
</h1> <p>
The fire at the Soudan mine did not directly affect MINOS, but a
power cable was damaged and the foam used to put out the fire did
enter the MINOS lab and bring dirt with it.  At the end of May,
the MINOS Far Detector magnet coil was returned to full current
and is operating normally.  Staff at the Soudan Lab together with
personnel from the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and
private contractors worked diligently in the last month to clean
the lab and get the detector working.  However, the NuMI target
NT06 failed before MINOS was back on, and only NT01, a restored
target which might not take full power is available now.  MINOS
was running antineutrinos before the fire, while Minerva wants
neutrinos, and Fermilab management has announced that MINOS is
requested to open the box on anti-neutrinos.  MINOS wanted 2e20
more pot after 1.7 shown previously, but now has less than before.

*** T2K oscillation rumor
</h1> <p>
The T2K experiment from Tokai to Super-Kamiokande will present
results on 4-5 times the protons on target (pot) of their previous
public result.  They have an "exciting new oscillation result" but
I don't know what it is.  When I hear what it is, I will cover
it again (re-cover?).

*** Recovery from the NSF decision on DUSEL
</h1> <p>
The Marx committee, appointed by the DOE to help determine if the
DOE should manage the Homestake mine for LBNE in view of the NSF's
decision not to proceed with DUSEL, finished their report and gave
it to the DOE's Bill Brinkman at a briefing on 1 June.  I don't
know what it says.  Glenn Crawford reported to the Fermilab Users
meeting that the briefing "went well" and the result will be made
public on 15 June.  The DOE has $15M in its FY12 budget for
pumping at the mine.  See

*** American Recovery Funds have helped fund NOvA get a touchdown
</h1> <p>
NOvA got a boost of ARRA funding, but will soon be over the peak in
its funding profile, going from $59M in FY10 to $41M in FY12.  And
Gavin Davies's Quantum Diaries entry about NOvA was the most read
article submitted from Fermilab last month.

*** DOE secretary Chu, "The recovery is underway."
</h1> <p>
Appearing at Fermilab and Argonne last week, Secretary of Energy
Stephen Chu quoted John Kennedy's message to Congress 25 May 1961.

</a>
Much of the speech could be given again today, but a bottom line
was to go to the moon.  Quotes include, "The first and basic task
confronting this nation this year was to turn recession into
recovery...The recession has been halted. Recovery is under way."
And "I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving
the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon
and returning him safely to the earth."  In Congress, Chu said
the NSF decision on DUSEL was "disappointing".

*** Mis-coverage of neutrinos at Fermilab
</h1> <p>
MINOS was covered by the Chicago TV station WTTW on its May 25
"Chicago Tonight" show, from 2:42 to 5:05 in Scientific Chicago:

http://www.wttw.com/main.taf?p=42,2,1,1&amp;date=05/25/2011
</a>
The video story is MINOS.  The "link" is to Minerva; close enough.

*** 2011 Neutrino Summer School in Switzerland
</h1> <p>
The International Neutrino Summer School 2011 (INSS11) will be
hosted 18-30 July 2011 by University of Geneva and CERN in the
Geneva countryside.  The school curriculum extends from "neutrinos
in the Standard Model." to introductions to the most advanced
detector and accelerator technologies.  The School is open to all
neutrino students, undergraduates, graduates or advanced
physicists who want to know more.  You can request support to
participate in the school by following instructions on the web
site.  See
<a href="http://dpnc.unige.ch/NeutrinoSummerSchool2011/"> http://dpnc.unige.ch/NeutrinoSummerSchool2011/.

*** MiniBooNE protons
</h1> <p>
The MiniBooNE experiment, which uses protons from the Fermilab
Booster, recently had their best week ever, with 0.13e20 pot in 1
week while running antineutrinos.  They have previously shown an
anomaly (excess events in the 2 neutrino LSND region with anti-nus
with 5.66e20 pot and will show the result from 8.5e20 pot later
this year.  They expect 10e20 by next year's shutdown.
