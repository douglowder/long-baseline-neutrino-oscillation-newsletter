*** Don't PANIC (KamLAND's result)
</h1>
Participants at the PANIC meeting Oct. 2 in Osaka should expect to 
hear the comparison of the expected and observed event rates at 
KamLAND.   [kaLMAnd?]

*** 42 (The solution to the solar neutrino problem)
</h1>
 S. P. Mikheyev and A. Yu. Smirnov, Yad. Fiz. 42, 1441 (1985) 
[Sov. J. Nucl. Phys. 42, 913 (1986)]; After the SNO results, the 
solar neutrino problem seems solved, (if KamLAND is LMA).  Do we 
need more computers and more experiments?

*** So Long and Thanks for all the Physics (Friedel Sellschrop)
</h1>
Namibian born physicist Friedel Sellschop died in August aged 72. 
After Fred Reines detected man made neutrinos at Savannah River, 
Sellschop contacted him about using deep gold mines in South 
Africa to detect cosmic neutrinos.  They placed a detector 3 km 
below the surface in Boksburg, where the first atmospheric 
neutrino was detected February 23, 1965.  Sellschop quoted Keats,
"Then felt I like some watcher of the skies
When a new planet swims into his ken."

*** Betelgeuse (OMNIS proposal)
</h1>
Ford Prefect is from a small moon in the vicinity of this nearby 
supernova candidate.  The OMNIS experiment plans to measure all 
flavors of neutrino from a supernova anywhere in the galaxy.  
A Phase I Sep. proposal will request funding to build two 0.5 kT 
lead slab modules and to do the R&D necessary to build one or two 
lead perchlorate modules.  Tom Lecompte is now project manager.

<p> <h1>
*** Douglas (New MINOS co-spokesman)
</h1>
Doug Michael is newly elected as co-spokesman of MINOS.  Doug has 
led the scintillator effort on MINOS and is now leading the 
effort to add a veto shield so that the now-operating MINOS 
detector can better measure atmospheric neutrinos as it waits for 
beam in 2005.  Still on the web: "How to talk like Doug"

*** Adam (Off-axis proposal)
</h1>
Adam Para is leading the effort to plan a new off-axis detector 
in the Fermilab NuMI beam.  An LOI was submitted in June  
<a href="http://www-numi.fnal.gov/fnal_minos/new_initiatives/loi_6.00.ps"> 
http://www-numi.fnal.gov/fnal_minos/new_initiatives/loi_6.00.ps </a>
The PAC had 8 questions, involving the optimum location and 
detector, the discovery reach, understanding the background, near 
detector issues, CP reach, cosmic ray backgrounds, and other 
physics capabilities.  Adam is also managing a mail list,

*** SEP field (How to pay for a Linear Collider)
</h1>
The best way to deal with any annoying problem or embarrassment is 
to paint it pink and put an SEP field around it (Somebody Else's 
Problem) and this will render it invisible for all practical 
purposes except out of the corner of someone's eye when pretending 
to look at something else.   Future neutrino projects will 
depend, in part, on where and when a linear collider is planned 
and built, and how much it costs.

*** Take a towel (MINOS caldet run at CERN)
</h1>
MINOS is testing a 60 plane calorimeter module using both its near 
and far detector electronics at CERN.  This test is called CALDET.  
Runs in 2001-2003 expose it to pi's, p's, e's and mu's from 1 to 
10 GeV in T7 and T11.  There ~3000 channels of electronics.  At an 
apartment near CERN which is rented for this run, there are sheets 
but no towels provided.  

<p> <h1>
*** Falling up (Upward Muons in MACRO)
</h1>
The trick to flying is to fall and miss the ground completely.  
Most neutrinos do that all the time, but once in a while will hit 
something.  MACRO has used its upward going muons to measure 
neutrino oscillations.  Most recently, they have used the 
multiple scattering as an energy estimate in order to make an L/E 
plot.  Their oscillation fits agree with Super-Kamiokande.

*** JHF workshop will continue planning JHF2K
</h1>
The 2nd International Workshop on Nuclear and Particle Physics at 
the 50-GeV PS will be at Kyoto University 27-29 Sep. 2002.
<a href="http://www-jhf.kek.jp/NP02/"> http://www-jhf.kek.jp/NP02/ </a>
  Meanwhile, the design of a nu beam
was completed and a budget request to the Government was 
submitted. It aims for the completion of the nu facility FY06
after 4 year construction.
