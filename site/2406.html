*** NuFACT 2024 in September at Argonne National Laboratory
</H1> <P>
Abstract submission and registration are open for NuFACT 2024, the
25th International Workshop on Neutrinos from Accelerators at
Argonne Lab 16-21 September.  A lively program of neutrino, muon
and accelerator physics is planned.  The registration fee is low
for a conference these days.

*** Satellite NuFact Workshop on multi-exp oscillation analyses
</H1> <P>
On Sunday 15 Sep. there will be a satellite workshop as part of
NuFact24 on multi-experiment oscillation measurements, with an eye
towards the DUNE and Hyper-K era.  Information will be put on the
NuFact website or contact Mark Scott at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="f994d78a9a968d8dc9c0b99094899c8b909895d7989ad78c92">[email&#160;protected]</a>.

<H1>
*** Inaugural muon collider meeting 7-9 August at FNAL.
</H1> <P>
The inaugural meeting for the US Muon Collider community will be
7-9 Aug. at Fermilab.  This meeting will be open to the community
with the goal to engage broader participation in the muon collider
effort, familiarize new groups with the current status of physics,
accelerator and detector developments, discuss ways they can
contribute to the effort, and take the next steps in forming a US
Muon Collider collaboration.

*** Neutrino 2024 highlights; 2026 and 2028 plans
</H1> <P>
A large number of exciting new results were presented in Milano at
Neutrino 2024.  See 
<A href="https://agenda.infn.it/event/37867/timetable/">
https://agenda.infn.it/event/37867/timetable/
</A>
There were 71 scientific talks and 460 posters chosen from 616
abstracts (66% of which were submitted in the last 3 days).  There
were 855 registered participants, but only 828 made it to Milano.
31% were students or within 4 years of their Ph.D.  Neutrino 2026
will be at UC Irvine, chaired by Mu-chun Chen and Michael Smy.
Neutrino 2028 will be in Beijing China, chairs Jun Cao & Wei Wang.  

<H1>
*** NNN 2024 in Rio Registration open
</H1> <P>
The 23rd International Workshop on Next Generation Nucleon Decay
and Neutrino Detectors will be 28 Oct - 1 Nov in Rio de Janeiro
Brazil.

*** SBND is successfully taking data now
</H1> <P>
The Short-Baseline Near Detector (SBND) Time Projection Chamber 
reached full voltage on 3 July in the Fermilab Booster Beam.  The
detector has been operating stably since then, seeing its first
neutrino events, and will collect neutrino data through the end of
this year’s accelerator run. 

<H1>
*** Daya Bay Hydrogen analysis
</H1> <P>
Reactor neutrino experiments use Gd to capture neutrons and tag
inverse beta decay.  But they have found that Hydrogen capture is
also effective.  In 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01007"> arXiv:2406.01007, </A>
Daya Bay showed their data
on H capture from 1958 days.  Combining H and 3158 days of Gd,
they got sin^2(2-q13) = 0.0833+-0.0022, 8% better than Gd alone.

<H1>
*** NOvA adds considerable statistics for neutrino oscillations
</H1> <P>
NOvA doubled their neutrino data since their previous release 4y
ago, including adding a new low-E sample of nu-e's. The new data
are consistent with previous NOvA results with improved precision.
NOvA favors the “normal” ordering of neutrino masses more strongly
than before.  NOvA will continue running through early 2027.

***  EuCAPT Astroneutrino Theory Workshop in Prague 2024
</H1> <P>
The European Consortium for Astroparticle Theory is holding
its second Astroneutrino Theory Workshop in Prague, Czech Republic
16-27 Sep. 2024.  The scientific agenda of the Workshop is focused
on the role of nus in astroparticle & cosmological phenomena. In
particular it will focus on the New Neutrino Interactions proposed
beyond the Standard Model.

*** NuMI Breaks 1 MW!
</H1> <P>
On 26 June, the Fermilab Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI)
beam set a new 1-hour power record of 1.011 MW due to a faster
cycle time. NuMI won't be operating at this power continuously
since the MI beam is shared with other experiments.  
 
<H1>
*** Jim Kerby is the new LBNF/DUNE-US Project Director
</H1> <P>
He'll be responsible for managing everything supporting execution
of the project, including program leadership, strategic planning
and general oversight. He will serve as primary point of contact
to external stakeholders and collaborators.  He has worked on the
LHC in Geneva and ANL's Advanced Photon Source Upgrade project.

<H1>
*** SIREN: An Open Source Neutrino Injection Toolkit
</H1> <P>
In 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01745"> arXiv:2406.01745, </A>
A. Schneider et al. present a new tool for nu
phenomenology and experimental searches (SIREN), which enables
accurate interaction and detector geometry modeling without the
overhead of detailed detector response simulations.

<H1>
*** Tau neutrinos seen in IceCube
</H1> <P>
In 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02516"> arXiv:2403.02516, </A>
using 9.7 years of data, IceCube observes 7
astrophysical tau neutrinos with a background of about 0.5 events.
The energies range from roughly 20 TeV to 1 PeV, mean of 200 TeV.
