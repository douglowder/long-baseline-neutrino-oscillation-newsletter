*** U.S. Senate wants neutrino report; 180 days from ?

"The Committee also recognizes the recommendation made in the 2008
report of the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel to
develop a world-leading program of neutrino science to understand
the role neutrinos play in the evolution of the universe. The
United States has unique capabilities and infrastructure at
Fermilab to advance this area of science. The Committee supports
design work for two new potential construction projects--the Long-
Baseline Neutrino Experiment and the Muon to Electron Conversion
Experiment. However, the Committee directs the Office of Science
to submit a report not later than 180 days after enactment of this
act that lays out (1) the expected benefits of intensity frontier
science, (2) a strategy for maintaining the U.S. lead, and (3) the
funding needs over the next 10 years, including construction
activities, of implementing the proposed strategy. The Committee
also is concerned about the status of the Deep Underground Science
and Engineering Laboratory [DUSEL] funded by the National Science
Foundation [NSF]. The neutrino program relies on the construction
of DUSEL and any delays in the DUSEL program would impact advances
in this area of science." If enacted, probably after November 2.

*** 90% for MINOS; 90% for MINERvA at Fermilab
</h1> <p>
Is that 180%?  MINOS has asked for more antineutrino running,
while Minerva prefers the higher rates from Neutrinos.  The
Fermilab PAC "recommends sharing the shortfall of POT such that
MINOS receives ~90% of the total requested POT for antineutrino
running and MINERvA receives ~90% of the total requested POT for
neutrino running - assuming the current operation capabilities
of the NuMI beamline".

</p><h1>
*** MiniBooNE to end early?
</h1> <p>
The PAC and FNAL management decided to allow MicroBooNE use the
MiniBooNE detector hall. This requires MiniBooNE to end the run in
May 11 instead of the start of the 2012 shutdown, to dismantle it
and to give the hall over to mircoBooNE.  MiniBooNE would only get
to 8E20 POT, which would fall short of doubling the current
analyzed data set.  They object to this new plan. Their recent
antineutrino results with 5.7E20 POT is consistent with LSND at
the 2.7 sigma level. However, it desperately needs more data to
make it statistically robust.  In fact, the fitted significance
improves up to 20E20 POT (where stat error no longer dominates).

*** Super-K Solar neutrinos; day/night effect at 90% CL.
</h1> <p>
New Solar results from Super-K III were presented at Neutrino 2010

A tight fiducial volume cut is applied for the lowest energy
events, E&lt;5.5 MeV.  The systematic error on the total flux has
been reduced by precise calibrations and software improvements
from 3.5% in SK-1 to 2.1% in SK-III.  The 8B flux is 2.32 +- 0.04
(stat) +- 0.05(syst) 1e6/cm^2/s.  The day night ratio 2(D-N)/(D+N)
is -0.056 +- 0.031(stat) +- 0.013(syst.) for SK-III.  All Super-K
day/night measurements have the same sign, and combined, it is
two sigma (stat only) from zero and consistent
with the best fit oscillation results.

*** NuFACT10 20-25 October in Mumbai, India
</h1> <p>
NuFACT2010 is the twelfth edition of a series of workshops
started in 1999, whose main goal is to understand the different
options for a future neutrino oscillation experiment able to
attack the problems of mass hierarchy and CP violation in the
leptonic sector. 20-25 Oct 2010 at Tata Institute for Fundamental
Research.  Registration at

*** Everyone gets 100% at Neutrino University
</h1> <p>
Neutrino University is a series of informal, informative
and interactive presentations for summer students and
ignorant collider physicists on the Fermilab Neutrino
Program, organized by Paul Nienaber.  Go to the docdb site

*** "The most accurate measurement of the mass of the neutrino"

A new limit, &lt; 0.28 eV.  If you don't find it, is that accurate?

*** Neutrino/Antineutrino differences

MINOS and MiniBooNE each recently presented data which could be
interpreted as different neutrino oscillation results for nus
and anti-nus.
