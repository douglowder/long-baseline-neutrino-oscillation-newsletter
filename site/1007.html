*** U.S. Senate wants neutrino report; 180 days from ?
</H1> <P>
<A href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/cpquery/?&dbname=cp111&sid=cp111fShsa&refer=&r_n=sr228.111&item=&&&sel=TOC_513239&">

"The Committee also recognizes the recommendation made in the 2008 
report of the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel to 
develop a world-leading program of neutrino science to understand 
the role neutrinos play in the evolution of the universe. The 
United States has unique capabilities and infrastructure at 
Fermilab to advance this area of science. The Committee supports 
design work for two new potential construction projects--the Long-
Baseline Neutrino Experiment and the Muon to Electron Conversion 
Experiment. However, the Committee directs the Office of Science 
to submit a report not later than 180 days after enactment of this 
act that lays out (1) the expected benefits of intensity frontier 
science, (2) a strategy for maintaining the U.S. lead, and (3) the 
funding needs over the next 10 years, including construction 
activities, of implementing the proposed strategy. The Committee 
also is concerned about the status of the Deep Underground Science 
and Engineering Laboratory [DUSEL] funded by the National Science 
Foundation [NSF]. The neutrino program relies on the construction 
of DUSEL and any delays in the DUSEL program would impact advances 
in this area of science." If enacted, probably after November 2.

*** 90% for MINOS; 90% for MINERvA at Fermilab
</H1> <P>
Is that 180%?  MINOS has asked for more antineutrino running, 
while Minerva prefers the higher rates from Neutrinos.  The
Fermilab PAC "recommends sharing the shortfall of POT such that
MINOS receives ~90% of the total requested POT for antineutrino
running and MINERvA receives ~90% of the total requested POT for
neutrino running - assuming the current operation capabilities 
of the NuMI beamline". 

<H1>
*** MiniBooNE to end early?
</H1> <P>
The PAC and FNAL management decided to allow MicroBooNE use the
MiniBooNE detector hall. This requires MiniBooNE to end the run in 
May 11 instead of the start of the 2012 shutdown, to dismantle it 
and to give the hall over to mircoBooNE.  MiniBooNE would only get 
to 8E20 POT, which would fall short of doubling the current 
analyzed data set.  They object to this new plan. Their recent 
antineutrino results with 5.7E20 POT is consistent with LSND at 
the 2.7 sigma level. However, it desperately needs more data to 
make it statistically robust.  In fact, the fitted significance 
improves up to 20E20 POT (where stat error no longer dominates). 

<H1>
*** Super-K Solar neutrinos; day/night effect at 90% CL.
</H1> <P>
New Solar results from Super-K III were presented at Neutrino 2010

A tight fiducial volume cut is applied for the lowest energy
events, E<5.5 MeV.  The systematic error on the total flux has
been reduced by precise calibrations and software improvements
from 3.5% in SK-1 to 2.1% in SK-III.  The 8B flux is 2.32 +- 0.04
(stat) +- 0.05(syst) 1e6/cm^2/s.  The day night ratio 2(D-N)/(D+N) 
is -0.056 +- 0.031(stat) +- 0.013(syst.) for SK-III.  All Super-K 
day/night measurements have the same sign, and combined, it is 
two sigma (stat only) from zero and consistent 
with the best fit oscillation results.

*** NuFACT10 20-25 October in Mumbai, India
</H1> <P>
NuFACT2010 is the twelfth edition of a series of workshops 
started in 1999, whose main goal is to understand the different 
options for a future neutrino oscillation experiment able to 
attack the problems of mass hierarchy and CP violation in the 
leptonic sector. 20-25 Oct 2010 at Tata Institute for Fundamental
Research.  Registration at

*** Everyone gets 100% at Neutrino University
</H1> <P>
Neutrino University is a series of informal, informative
and interactive presentations for summer students and
ignorant collider physicists on the Fermilab Neutrino 
Program, organized by Paul Nienaber.  Go to the docdb site

to see the presentations.  All homework gets an A+.

*** "The most accurate measurement of the mass of the neutrino"
</H1> <P>
A new limit, < 0.28 eV.  If you don't find it, is that accurate?

*** Neutrino/Antineutrino differences
</H1> <P>
MINOS and MiniBooNE each recently presented data which could be
interpreted as different neutrino oscillation results for nus
and anti-nus.

*** Why is there something rather than nothing?

President Sarkozy of France likes neutrino research, though he 
never mentioned it.  ICHEP talk; Transcript-
