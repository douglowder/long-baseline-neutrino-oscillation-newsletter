<P> 


<H1>
*** Gina Rameika new Office of Science Associate Director for HEP
</H1> <P>
DUNE spokesperson Regina Rameika is starting a new position in top
management at the Department of Energy.  They wrote, "Gina has
demonstrated tremendous leadership in the national laboratory
environment with DOE projects and with international science
collaborations.  An election for DUNE cospokesperson is underway.

<H1>
*** Neutrino platform week at CERN in March
</H1> <P>
In March 2023 there will be a neutrino theory/pheno workshop at
CERN. 
<A href="https://indico.cern.ch/e/neutrino-platform-week-2023">
https://indico.cern.ch/e/neutrino-platform-week-2023.
</A>
  The
focus will be primarily on nu phenomenology and theory and will
cover nus in terrestrial experiments, astrophysics, & cosmology.

<H1>
*** Sexual Harassment case on neutrino experiments
</H1> <P>
A shocking case of misconduct has led to an individual's removal
from the NOvA and DUNE neutrino experiments and author lists.

A Snowmass white paper, "Climate of the Field: Snowmass 2021" in
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03713"> arXiv:2204.03713 </A>
 discusses the current climate in HEP and astro,
and efforts toward providing the community a more diverse,
inclusive, and equitable environment.  A series of recommendations
for the community and the funding agencies includes, "(we) must
employ the use of robust strategic planning procedures, including
a full re-envisioning of science workplace norms and culture."

<H1>
*** MicroBooNE limits sterile neutrino oscillations
</H1> <P>
Previously MicroBooNE didn't see a low-energy excess of electron
neutrinos, which seemed to conflict with the sterile neutrino
interpretation of the MiniBooNE data.  Now in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10216"> arXiv:2210.10216 </A>
they present the first constraints on light sterile neutrino
oscillations from combined appearance and disappearance searches.
They observe no evidence of light sterile neutrinos, and present
exclusion limits.  They also point out that cancellation of nue
appearance and disappearance effects leads to degeneracy.

<H1>
*** NOvA Test Beam concludes run
</H1> <P>
A small scale version of the NOvA Detector in a tertiary FNAL beam
of charged particles, to measure + and - pi's, p's, K's & e's in
NOvA, is known as NOvA's Test Beam, momentum from 0.5 to 1.25 GeV.
The last spill was midnight 9 July. Decommissioning is continuing.
Analysis of NOvA's response to these single particles is ongoing.

<H1>
*** Solar Neutrinos and planet building
</H1> <P>
We know that the sun is a prolific neutrino source. A few hundred
meters from a nuclear reactor, the nu flux from the sun exceeds
the antinu flux from the reactor.  In 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06900"> arXiv:2210.06900, </A>
Kunitomo
et al. argue that planet formation processes have a significant
contribution to present-day solar nu fluxes.

<H1>
*** Neutrinos and Jupiter, Neptune, and Asteroid Bennu
</H1> <P>
In 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04761"> arXiv:2210.04761, </A>
French and Sher make a case that Jupiter
could be a source of monoenergetic neutrinos from 1-4 GeV WIMP
annihilation, whereas in the Sun, those WIMPS would evaporate
before annihilation.  In 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05913"> arXiv:2210.05913, </A>
English and Solomey
present a concept study for observing galactic neutrinos in the
atmosphere of Neptune.  And Tsai et al. use accurate tracking data
of the asteroid (101955) Bennu to constrain possible cosmic
neutrino overdensities and Dark Matter in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03749"> arXiv:2210.03749. </A>
(As always, the newsletter web version has direct links.)

<H1>
*** Neutrinos from MARS15 is good for DUNE
</H1> <P>
In this instance, MARS is not a planet but instead a detailed
model of the entire LBNF complex that has been developed using a
3D MAD-X based beamline builder and ROOT geometry.  See I. Rakhno
et al, "Optimization Studies for the Long-Baseline Neutrino
Facility at Fermilab", 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07752"> arXiv:2210.07752 </A>

<H1>
*** GRB-221009A is out of our solar system and galaxy

*** Neutrino Snow-White 
<A href="https://snowmass21.org/submissions/nf">
https://snowmass21.org/submissions/nf
</A>
</H1> <P>
As the Snowmass preparation phase is getting a diminishing number
of new white papers, this newsletter has previously highlighted 30
of the 88 white papers listed at the link above.  A few more non-
overlapping papers can be found on the neutrino theory working
group page  TF11.  
<A href="https://snowmass21.org/theory/neutrino">

</A>
Working
group summaries are on the arXiv. The approximately 500 page
Snowmass Book was scheduled for October/November 2022.  More than
1500 people participated in the Snowmass process this time!
