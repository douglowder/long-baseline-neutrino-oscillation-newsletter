*** NuEclipse 21 August 2017
</H1> <p>
A workshop on physics that can be done with neutrino experiments
at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory
will take place 20-22 August in Knoxville TN.  They have also
arranged for a nearby total eclipse of the sun on 21 August, and
will have an excursion to view it on that day.  No flash photos.

*** Neutrino Day 8 July 2017
</H1> <p>
South Dakota isn't on the path of the eclipse, but if you attend
the Neutrino Day activities at Sanford Underground Research
Facility on 7-8 July, you can then drive into the path of the
August eclipse.  See

*** Neutrino Shadow?
</H1> <p>
When the moon is in front of the sun, will that affect any solar
neutrino experiments?  Not hardly.  I was asked this month if the
shadow of the moon had ever been seen in a neutrino experiment.
I quickly answered no.  The earth is opaque to UHE neutrinos, but
the flux is small.

<H1>
*** NuFACT 25-30 September 2017 in Uppsala
</H1> <p>
If you've not won a Nobel prize, you want to book your ticket to
Stockholm anyway for the 2017 International Workshop on Neutrinos
from Accelerators (NuFACT2017).  Expect a full neutrino program.  
Registration is open at

*** KATRIN first light
Back in October, the KArlruhe TRItium Neutrino (KATRIN)
</H1> <p>
experiment guided its first electrons through the 70 m beamline.
It will be sensitive to a combination of neutrino mass and mixing
angles at 350 meV.

*** March for Neutrino Science on Earth Day
</H1> <p>
Some signs you might have seen at the science march:  "Neutrinos,
not afraid to make waves", "The Universe is made up of protons,
neutrons, electrons, neutrinos and morons".  "Neutrinos, walls are
no barrier", One member of a neutrino collaboration carried a sign
"Do you want last year's flu shot?" There was a possible allusion
to oscillations in the coupled "protest sine" & "protest cosine".

*** When does DUNE reach 1000 people?
</H1> <p>
A thousand is an arbitrary milestone for a physics collaboration,
but it an unprecedented one for a neutrino experiment.  There are
currently 966 DUNE collaborators.  But the number of names in the
DUNE database currently stands at 1001, including people involved
in the collaboration who are not collaborators.  Plus there are
another 143 former collaborators who have moved on since the 
beginning of the collaboration in early 2015.

<H1>
*** Neutrino Question of the week
</H1> <p>
The Fermilab Neutrino Physics Center is launching the "Neutrino
Question of the Week".  The first question is "Why does the sun
produce neutrinos while nuclear reactors produce antineutrinos?"

*** LArSoft Tools and Technology Workshop 20 June
</H1> <p>
LArSoft is a software framework for liquid Argon detectors that
current and future neutrino experiments will use.  A free one-day
workshop on Tue 20 June at Fermilab will include lectures,
demonstrations and tutorials as well as new tools in LArSoft.

*** U.S. budget for HEP for the rest of 2017; more for LBNF
</H1> <p>
There have been many numbers publicized recently for HEP and the
Office of Science in the US DOE's budget.  There was President
Obama's proposed budget, a house budget, a senate budget, a Trump
budget proposal, all for fiscal year 2017, as well as proposals
for 2018.  But in the final approved 17 budget, LBNF received "$5
million more than requested..." according to AIP's FYI:
