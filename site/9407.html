</p><h1>Collaboration-forming Meeting August 12th</h1>
A collaboration is forming to respond to the Long Baseline
opportunity from the Fermilab June PAC report.  If you are
interested in participating, contact Maury Goodman, Doug Michael
or Stan Wojcicki.

</p><h1>Kamiokande result on semicontained events; oscillation like.</h1>
In a preprint on new results from multi-GeV neutrino
interactions, Kamiokande has additional evidence that the
atmospheric neutrino deficit may be neutrino oscillations.
In addition to their previously reported contained events, they
measure 98 e-like and 135 mu-like events with E(vis)&gt;1.33 GeV,
while they expect 66.5 e-like and 162.2 mu-like events.  The
ratio of ratios for this data set is 0.57 +-0.08.  More
impressive is the angular dependence which rises from 0.5 for
upgoing neutrinos (L ~ 12000 km) to 1.0 for downgoing events
(L~20km).  If oscillations, this suggests near-maximal mixing
and delta m-squared near 10^-2 eV^2; consistent with previous
analyses of atmospheric neutrinos (other than Frejus) but
constraining the parameters more tightly.
<p>
</p><h1>LSND/Karmen</h1>
The hint from LSND was in Scientific American (below), though
it seems to be in conflict with a Karmen analysis.  To be
oscillations, LSND would require <p> ~ 1%.  Karmen rules out
down to 3 10^-3, though there is a hole at 6 eV^2 based on a
simple total signal/total background analysis.  However when
Karmen does an energy analysis, the 6eV^2 hole closes.  LSND
will take more data this summer.   It will be interesting to see
how many theorists now "predict" an inverted nu mass hierarchy.

</p><h1>Long Baseline strategy debated at Snowmass</h1>
A wide variety of opinions were expressed, from letting the
cosmic ray people study the question first to doing a low energy
experiment first.  No unanimous consensus emerged.  It seemed to
me that the majority opinion was to design a massive calorimeter
to take advantage of the proposed high energy beams at FNAL or
CERN.
<p>
</p><h1>Fermilab Beam options</h1>
In response to suggestions by S. Wojcicki, beam calculations at
Fermilab are being done on what the loss in flux from a
Dichromatic beam would be.  The default neutrino oscillation
running plan remains to be a double horn.  It is important in
the civil engineering designs, however, to plan for future
flexibility.
<p>
</p><h1>Snowmass transparencies available.</h1>
Transparencies are available for one opening talk on ICARUS, 9
atmospheric neutrinos talks, 26 Long baseline talks, and one
summary talk on neutrino oscillations.  For copies or a list,
send to anlhep::mcg or .
<p>
</p><h1>Baikal</h1>
Baikal has a 36 PMT array (3 strings) running. Background to
signal (atm. mu to atm nu) about 100, hope to get something
like 1-5 next year with a 96 PMT array.

</p><h1>Tom Kirk to replace Mel Schwartz at Brookhaven</h1>
He'll be a strong advocate of a neutrino program there.
<p>
</p><h1> ICARUS receives engineering approval</h1>
At a meeting at CERN July 5th, the INFN committee gave approval
for ICARUS to proceed with engineering of the 5 kton detector.
Some skepticism has greeted the 62M cost, with private estimates
as high as 150M Swiss Francs.  The safety concern can be put in
perspective by the fact that there is 500 tons of air in the
entire Gran Sasso Lab and tunnel.  A 10% Liquid Ar (5kTon) spill
would drive all of the air out of the tunnel.
ICARUS wants to be available for the "window" at CERN between
LEP200 and LHC.  If LHC has been delayed till past 2006(?) by
the CERN council decision postponement, this window may be
easier to reach.

</p><h1>CERN Longbaseline meeting August 4th</h1>
The meeting will focus on CERN beam issues.   It will start
around 10:00 am.  For further information contact Doug Michael
or Flavio Cavanna.
