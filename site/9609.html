*** CERN neutrino studies
</h1>The CERN neutrino community is working together on possible
future plans for neutrino experiments at CERN.  There are
working groups on three topics which will write reports;
1) Inclusive studies (aimed at numu--&gt;nutau with upgraded
Nomad/Chorus type detectors, 2) Special Topologies,
including quasi-elastic events for oscillations and tagged
neutrino beams, and 3) Beam studies.  At a meeting
September 3rd, further short-baseline and medium-baseline
(5-17km) experiments were discussed.  Lorenzo Foa, CERN's
director of research, encouraged consideration of Cern to
Gran Sasso experiments, and that will be studied as well.
There is some fear that the financial constraints of the LHC
will adversely affect neutrino running, but there is also some
feeling that CERN management nonetheless will react favorably
to a neutrino program between the end of LEP and the LHC.

*** Solar Neutrino Oscillations in Magnetic Fields
</h1>Last December, an apparent correlation of solar neutrinos with
mass flow in the solar wind was reported in Science Magazine.
R. McNutt compared 19 years of Homestake data with solar wind
mass flux as measured by the MIT plasma experiment on the
IMP-8 spacecraft.   Now Peter Sturrock and Guenther Walther
of Stanford have found a 21.3 day cycle in the Homestake,
Gallex and Kamiokande data.   If correct, one physics
interpretation would involve an inhomogeneous magnetic field in
a rotating solar core and a neutrino magnetic moment.

*** European Conference on future neutrinos
</h1>There will be a workshop in Frascati on "Present and Future of
the Neutrino Physics in Europe" on November 4 and 5. As part of
the program, there will be a panel discussion on long-baseline
projects, chaired by DiLella.   Information is available at
http://www.mi.infn.it/INFN-DIP/Nunuwork.html

*** Auger Project Selects Site
</h1>Th Auger experiment, which will have some very high energy
neutrino capability, has chosen a site in Millard County, Utah,
for its northern hemisphere site to go along with the southern
hemisphere site near Mendoza, Argentina.  The main goal of
Auger is to study cosmic rays with energies 10^(20) eV and
higher.   Detector property estimates are (each) 1600 tanks,
3000 gallons of water, 3000 km^2 area, $100M cost.

*** Oak Ridge Meeting considers Neutrino experiment
</h1>A workshop at Oak Ridge considered the possibility of doing
LSND/Karmen type experiments at the pulsed neutron spallation
source.   If built, that machine will have two rings, one
1-2 Megawatt, and one 5 Megawatt.  The protons will then
bombard a heavy target, which is good for making neutrons, and
it makes decay at rest neutrinos but no decay in flight
neutrinos.  The neutrino intensity would be 20-30 times
higher than LSND and the effective duty cycle would be
under .1% (60Hz times 1/2 microsecond, but you have to
wait 10 microseconds or more for things to happen.)
Early detector thoughts are 1-2 kilotons, arranged more
like an area detector (LSND) than a volume one (Karmen)
because costs scale up slower.

*** Nu Industry web page adds non-English language links
</h1>You can now read about neutrinos in Finnish, French, German,
Italian and Japanese from this new section of the neutrino
industry page at www.hep.anl.gov/ndk/hypertext/nu_industry.html
