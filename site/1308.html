</p><h1>*** New results on theta13 from Daya Bay
</h1><p>
At NUFACT, Daya Bay presented a spectral analysis with 217 days of
6 detector running.  The rate-only value is sin^2(2q13) = 0.089
+- 0.009.  Their spectral analysis gives 0.090 + 0.008 - 0.009.
The two-neutrino mass squared difference is measured to be
Delta msquared_ee = 2.59 +.19-.20 x 10^(-3) eV^2 which corresponds
to 2.54 for the normal hierarchy and -2.64 inverted.

</p><h1>*** Snowmass, P5
</h1> <p>
At Snowmass the community spoke loudly and clearly that Fermilab
should have a flagship program and that it should be LBNE, and
that it should be underground.  The deadline for submission of
Snowmass white papers is 30 September.  Find neutrino papers at

</a>
The next step is a "P5" panel which is charged to "develop an updated strategic plan for U.S. high energy physics that can be
executed over a 10-year timescale, in the context of a 20-year
global vision for the field.  The full charge can be found at

The report is due 1 May 2014.

</p><h1>*** Carlo Rubbia appointed Senator for Life in Italy
</h1> <p>
Eminent Italian citizens can be appointed members of the Italian
Senate.  ICARUS spokesperson Carlo Rubbia received this honor.

</p><h1>*** Super-Kamiokande ten year plan
</h1> <p>
The Japanese funding agency MEXT gave Super-K one day to come up
with a ten year plan.  They have lots of plans so this was easy.
They will improve the water system and load Gadolinium for
the supernova relic neutrino system (GadZOOKs).  The will upgrade
the DAQ for continuous observation of nearby Supernova neutrino
bursts, upgrade J-PARC for measurements of CP violation, study the
mass hierarchy with atmospheric neutrinos, and search for sterile
neutrinos, nucleon decay and dark matter.

</p><h1>*** NOvA beam starts up
</h1> <p>
After a long accelerator shutdown, the first bit of beam has
started in the NuMI beamline.  The first neutrinos have gone
through the continuously expanding NOvA far detector, and a few
have been detected in the Near Detector on the Surface (NDOS).

The near detector is under construction and the mu catcher is in.

</p><h1>*** Support for the theory community
</h1> <p>
My challenge to theorists to predict the meaning of the mass
hierarchy measurement last month elicited many responses, which
I'll summarize in a future issue.  There is a petition from
experimentalists on the DPF Theory panel to collect signatures
from the experimental community to seek support for theory
research at

</p><h1>*** Reactor neutrino anomaly update, CeLAND and SOX
</h1> <p>
The reactor neutrino anomaly now stands as an observed to
predicted average event ratio for 10-100 m distant detectors
of 0.936 +- 0.024 or 2.7 sigma.  It could be tested with a strong
source in a scintillator detector.  There are plans for CeLAND, a
Cerium 144 source to placed in KamLAND.  At Borexino, SOX-A would
use an external Chromium 51 source, SOX-B an external Ce source
and SOX-C an internal CE source.

</p><h1>*** Global fit to short-baseline oscillation experiments
</h1> <p>
Giunti et al. present the results of a global analysis of
7 short-baseline experiments, all the reactor experiments,
and constraints for muon neutrino disappearance, in
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.5288"> arXiv:1308.5288 </a>.
The case of no oscillations is disfavored at six sigma.

</p><h1>*** Why is this a hint and not a discovery of sterile nus?
</h1> <p>
Physicists confront their data with a-priori tests and
a-posteriori tests.  They do the former when they know what to
look for; the latter when they see something unexpected.  Both
need to be done.  The calculations are identical.  The meaning
is very different.   Failure to make this distinction has led
to the 5 sigma standard which I don't like.

</p><h1>*** Muon to e gamma update, The MEG Experiment
</h1> <p>
They reported a new limit B(mu-e gamma) &lt; 5.7 10^(-13).  An
upgrade has been approved by PSI and the funding agencies which
should reach a sensitivity of 5 10^(-14) with a larger Xenon volume,
higher intensity and better position resolution, starting 2016.

</p><h1>*** Pontecorvo turns 100
</h1> <p>
In August the neutrino world celebrated the 100th birthday
of Bruno Pontecorvo, who first suggested neutrino to antineutrino
oscillations.  It is followed by celebrations at meetings in
Moscow, Dubna, Rome and Pisa.  A 59' movie has been produced,
"The history of Bruno Pontecorvo" by G. Mussardo &amp; D. Cenetiempo.
