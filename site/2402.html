*** Joint Fit between T2K and NOvA

The resulting fit for Delta m^2_32 has the smallest uncertainty
compared to previous measurements; 2.429 +0.039-0.035 e^-3 eV^2 NO
(normal mass order).  Small preference for the IO, whereas each
experiment prefers NO, but it reverts to a weak preference for NO
adding constraints from Daya Bay.  For CP, delta=pi/2 lies outside
the 3-sigma interval for both NO and IO.  A wide range of delta is
allowed for NO, but for IO, CP conservation falls outside 3 sigma.

*** "Neutrinos from Home" 2024 23–24 April & 30 April–1 May
</H1> <P>
This is an online conference at the boundary between neutrinos and
cosmology with a novel format, aiming to bring a real-world
workshop experience online. There'll be pre-recorded talks, & both
asynchronous & scheduled live discussions. A discussion space also
facilitates ongoing and face-to-face discussions.  Abstract
submission will close on 27 March.  Decisions will be made on a
rolling basis and the  total number of talks will be limited.

*** NuSTEC Workshop:  NuInt primer 11-13 April in São Paulo
</H1> <P>
A NuSTEC workshop that will take place immediately before NuInt24
at the same location.  The workshop is mainly aimed at students
and junior postdocs and will provide an overview of the current
status of nu-nucleus scattering, highlighting both experimental
and theoretical aspects of the field.  The program will include
lectures on nuclear models and nuclear effects in scattering, the
connection between interaction studies and oscillation physics,
and cross section measurements. Special attention will be paid to
the use of generators, including sessions with hands-on exercises.

*** NuINT 2024 15-20 April in São Paulo, Brazil.
</H1> <P>
NUINT 24 is the 14th in a series of workshops concentrating on
neutrino-nucleus interactions. The goal of the whole series is to
bring theorists & experimentalists from the nuclear & high-energy
community together to address the many challenges of understanding
these complex interactions.

*** INSS 2024 3-14 Jun 2024 in Bologna
</H1> <P>
The 15th International Neutrino Summer School brings together grad
students and postdocs, along with some of the best teachers and
researchers in neutrino physics, to create a 2-week-long learning
experience in an open and interactive environment that covers the
full range of modern neutrino physics.  It will be right before
Neutrino 2024 in Milan.

*** Neutrino 2024 16-22 June in Milano
</H1> <P>
The XXXI International Conference on Neutrino Physics and
Astrophysics will serve as a platform for the exchange of the
latest results, innovative ideas and future perspectives in the
fields of neutrino physics, astrophysics and cosmology.

*** NPML 25-28 June in Zurich
</H1> <P>
The Neutrino Physics and Machine Learning (NPML 2024) Workshop,
where cutting-edge research at the intersection of AI/ML and
Neutrino Physics will take center stage.

*** NuFACT 2024 16-21 September at Argonne in Illinois
</H1> <P>
The 25th International Workshop on Neutrinos from Accelerators
aims to review the progress of current and future facilities able
to improve on measurements of the properties of neutral & charged
lepton flavor violation, and to search for new phenomena beyond
the capabilities of presently planned experiments.  Registration
should open in mid April.

*** SBND cryostat has been filled with liquid Argon
</H1> <P>
During February and through 5 March, the Short-Baseline Near
Detector has been filled with liquid Argon.  Tests of the
circulation system are taking place.  Note to those who leave out
the hyphen, if the detector was short, the argon would spill.

<H1>
*** DUNE will install Vertical Drift module first
</H1> <P>
(From FNAL Director highlights 26 Feb) The Far Detector/Cryogenics
subproject is implementing in its schedule the DUNE Collaboration
Executive Board decision to proceed with the installation of the
Vertical Drift far detector (FD2) first in South Dakota, following
handover of the underground detector cavern.  This comes after
an assessment by a task force from UK, France, Italy, US and CERN.
