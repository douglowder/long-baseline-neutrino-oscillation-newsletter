*** LBNE reconfiguration
</h1> <p>
After deciding that LBNE which was being developed and had a $1.4B
estimated price could not be supported, Office of Science Director
Bill Brinkman asked Fermilab for a report on a phased approach.
That cost included a new 700kW beam, a 34 kT liquid Argon Far
Detector underground at Homestake, a Near Detector,
and some costs for that lab.
Fermilab appointed a steering committee with a timeline determined
by the need to provide detailed information on plans to Congress
for its consideration of the President's FY2013 Budget Request and
for the planning of the Office of Science budget proposals for 14.
A draft report will be delivered to Oddone by 1 Jun and the final
report by 1 Jul.  20 members of the steering committee are led by
Y.K. Kim.  A 15 member Physics Working Group is led by M. Shochet.
A 10 member cost group is chaired by M. Reichanadter &amp; J. Strait.

*** LBNE reconfiguration recapitulation
</h1> <p>
178 physicists attended a two day meeting at Fermilab to consider
the physics and options for long-baseline neutrino oscillations
using the NuMI beam and new detectors at Soudan or Ash River, and
a new beam with smaller detectors at Homestake.  50 stayed with 50
others for an LBNE collaboration meeting.  Surface detectors cost
less, but have less physics, if any.  Budget guidance for phase 1
is $600M.  The committee will choose acceptable Phase 1 options,
have a dialog with DOE-OHEP, and prepare a report.

*** LBNE appropriation recalculation
</h1> <p>
A congressional subcommittee added back $16M for LBNE to the
$10M in the President's budget for FY2013, = $26M.

</p><h1>
*** MINOS running rescission (i.e. end)
</h1> <p>
I started working on calculating neutrino oscillations using a
beam from Fermilab to Soudan in 1987.  This newsletter, with a
focus on that experiment started in 1992.  The MINOS collaboration
submitted its proposal in 1995.  The first neutrino from Fermilab
interacted in MINOS in 2005.  The last neutrino arrived last week.
MINOS+ will continue after the shutdown, but MINOS as originally
proposed has now ended with 15.6e20 total protons on target.

*** NOvA rededication at Ash River
</h1> <p>
NOvA broke ground in 2009 and the ribbon cutting ceremony was 27
April 2012.  There was no repetition of "the Ash River Address"
<a href="http://www.neutrinooscillation.org/poetry/np19.html">
http://www.neutrinooscillation.org/poetry/np19.html </a>
but over 250
people attended (cf. Orr MN population of 267).  The people of Orr
are excited to have NOvA in their area - many toured the detector
facility and asked many questions about neutrino work there.  Big
science is alive and well in northern Minnesota!

*** Bill Miller's Minnesota reception
</h1> <p>
The longtime director of the Soudan underground lab, and current
director of the Ash River lab will be given an award 4 June 2012
for his dedicated service to the neutrino community.  He will
receive the President's award for outstanding service from the
President and Board of Regents of the University of Minnesota.

*** RENO neutrino disappearance revision
</h1> <p>
Shortly after releasing its result for theta_13 from 229 days of
running with 2 detectors and 6 reactors, the RENO collaboration
released a revised result.  The ratio of observed to expected
numbers of antineutrinos in the far detector is now 0.920 +-
0.009(stat) +- 0.014(syst).  From this deficit, they now find
sin^2(2-q13) = 0.113 +-0.013(stat) +-0.019(syst), 4.9 standard
deviations from zero.

*** Neutrino reflection

Overheard at a neutrino discussion, "...with this we can get
information on theta_13, but that's so 2011."

*** European Strategy for Neutrino CERN reconvocation 14-16 May
</h1> <p>
A second neutrino town meeting to prepare input for the European
Strategy for Particle Physics will take place 14-16 May at CERN.

*** Electron neutrino disappearance recognition
</h1> <p>
Two centuries ago, Frank Darwin said "In Science the credit goes
to the man who convinces the world, not to the man to whom the
idea first occurred."   Let me violate that and give credit to the
Russians who first proposed a two detector reactor neutrino
disappearance experiment specifically to measure theta_13, L.
Mikaelyan &amp; V. Sinev.
