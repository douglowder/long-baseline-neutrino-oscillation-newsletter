*** CNGS beam from CERN to Gran Sasso restarted
</h1> <p>
After fixing a water leak in the horn and reflector, the CNGS beam
was restarted.  Beam was extracted to the target 21 Sep.  The 1st
Opera event was recorded 2 Oct.  Bricks, made of lead &amp; emulsion,
containing ten events were immediately removed from the detector
and dispatched to the various laboratories of the OPERA
Collaboration, which are equipped with automatic microscopes
required to read these special pictures and to measure the
relevant quantities.

*** NOvA passes its cost review
</h1> <p>
NOvA had its "Lehman review" for CD2, and it concluded that the
project is ready for CD2.  The project was presented at 15kt for
$260M, including detector and accelerator improvement costs.  The
model for escalation (i.e. inflation) might be optimistic, and one
option is 13 kton.  Next is an External Independent Review (EIS).

</p><h1>
*** Oil costs going up and down
</h1> <p>
NOvA needs 3.1 Million gallons of oil and tons of energy intensive
PVC, so the cost of NOvA is closely tied to the cost of crude oil.
In particular Conoco/Phillips Gulf Coast 70N Group II as tracked
in the Lube Report
<a href="http://www.lubereport.com/"> http://www.lubereport.com/ </a>
"base oil.."  Oil
recently had a dramatic price spike.  NOvA's TDR calculates a
contingency based on a historical model that has accurately
covered future oil prices 2 years out, 8 times out of 8.

*** Groundbreaking of Daya Bay reactor neutrino civil construction
</h1> <p>
The Daya Bay reactor neutrino experiment broke ground for civil
construction, which is expected to be completed in 2009. Data 2010
"I believe the Daya Bay Reactor Neutrino Experiment will achieve
full success with the efforts and wisdom of the scientists",
remarked Jinpei Cheng, Vice Minister of Ministry of Science and
Technology.  Robin Staffin, (now former) Director of the Office of
High Energy Physics of U.S. DOE said, "At the ground where we now
stand, scientists will measure with the world's greatest precision
one of the most important parameters of nature".

*** Selecting Homestake for DUSEL
</h1> <p>
A Deep Underground Science and Engineering Lab is currently the
highest priority for a new start in NSF physics.  A 22 member site
selection panel had unanimously picked Homestake by secret ballot
from 4 choices.  A $15M 3 year development contract has been made
to UC Berkeley led by Kevin Lesko.  This is a commitment to site,
design team &amp; facility design work, not to facility construction.

</p><h1>
*** DUSEL not yet a done deal
</h1> <p>
As a possible future Major Research Equipment &amp; Facilities
(MREFC), DUSEL will require approval by the National Science
Board, the NSF director and an administration and congress.  A
rough planning target is $500M split evenly between facility and
experiments, with a 7-8 year construction, constantly interleaving
experiments as ready.  Water is coming into Homestake at
700 gal/min, and has filled the shaft from 8000 feet to 4996 as
of 2 Nov 07.  If pumps aren't restarted soon, it is expected to
reach 4850 level in February 2008.  Their goal is to beat the
water to the 4850 level as efficiently and safely as possible.

*** "I'll give you the money" where happiness is a smoking gun
</h1> <p>
According to South Dakota Governor Rounds, a great occasion to get
business done is at a pheasant hunt.

</a>
At such an event, he told
philanthropist T. Denny Sanford how much could be done with $50M
for facility work and $20M for education and outreach for
Homestake.  As a room full of scientists at the National Academy
of Sciences discovered 2 Nov, Rounds can be persuasive, and there
is a $70M pledge for the lab from Sanford, together with the
South Dakota legislature's plan for $19.9M, a substantial sum for
a state of 700,000 people.  The governor told the meeting, "One
of my favorite subjects is neutrino-less double beta decay".

*** Indian Neutrino Observatory (INO) Approved
</h1> <p>
INO has been approved by the Dept of Atomic Energy (DAE).  DAE is
the funding agency for large high energy/nuclear physics projects
in India.  Accordingly the Planning Commission of the Government
of India has allocated the necessary funds for INO in its current
Five year plan allocation. To use the construction money, the INO
collaboration is now required to submit a detailed project report
&amp; funding request. It needs the final approval of the central
ministry before using the funds.  INO is planning a center at
Mysore. It plans to start generic detector R &amp; D, online &amp; offline
software development and physics simulation &amp; data analysis.
With the major funding for the project is now assured INO welcomes
international collaboration.

*** Merit Makes progress
<a href="http://cern.ch/merit/"> (http://cern.ch/merit/)

</h1> <p>
On 26 October at CERN, the MERIT experimental team produced the
first proton beam/Hg Jet interaction in a magnetic field.  The
principal parameters were: Hg Jet 15m/s; Solenoid  Field 5T,
Proton Beam intensity 10TP.

*** MicroBooNE proposal for Fermilab
</h1> <p>
There is a new proposal for a large liquid Argon Time Projection
Chamber at Fermilab in the Booster beam and also off-axis in the
NuMI beam.  It will address the low energy excess observed by the
MiniBooNE experiment, measure low energy neutrino cross sections,
and serve as the next step in a phased program towards liquid Ar
detectors.
