*** US/UK technology agreement features DUNE
</H1> <P>
An umbrella agreement on science and technology was signed in
September between the UK & the US.  As the 1st major collaboration
supported under the agreement, the U.K. has pledged $88 million
for construction of the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility/Deep
Underground Neutrino Experiment (LBNF/DUNE) hosted at FNAL.

*** Both Chooz reactors are off
</H1> <P>
Since the neutrino cross section is low, most neutrino experiments
try to maximize both the number of neutrinos and the detector
size.  Reactor neutrino experiments want the most flux possible,
which is proportional to reactor power.  Daya Bay, for example,
sits near six powerful reactors.  But background uncertainty can
be a source of systematic error, so it is a good thing for
Double Chooz, which sits near two reactors, if both reactors are
off and the background can be experimentally measured.  In a six
reactor site, this is unlikely for economic reasons.  Double Chooz
previously recorded a week of "off-off" for its far detector and
will use the current data to study near detector backgrounds.

*** Another subscriber wins Nobel Prize
</H1> <P>
Barry Barish is the fifth recipient of this newsletter with a
Nobel Prize.  The subject was gravitational waves, but in addition
to that and his work on the linear collider, he has long been a
neutrino physicist.  He was spokesperson for 7 neutrino proposals
at FNAL, and later played a major role in helping to define the
NuMI beam, which is still running for NOvA and MINERvA.

*** Construction of the ProtoDUNE detectors at CERN continues

*** NNN 2017 26-28 October in Warwick, UK
</H1> <P>
The 18th International Workshop on Next generation Nucleon decay &
Neutrino detectors will be at the University of Warwick 26-28 Oct.
See

Other meetings recently added to the neutrino meetings web page
are a NuWro workshop to discuss the Wroclaw Nu Event Generator
in Wroclaw Poland in Dec, PANE18 on the Physics of Atmospheric
Neutrinos at ICTP in Trieste Italy in May/Jun 2018, & NDM 18, Nus
& Dark Matter in Nuclear Physics in Daejon Korea in Jun/Jul 2018.

*** Optimizing the neutrino/antineutrino split
</H1> <P>
CP violation implies a difference between antineutrino and
neutrino oscillations.  But the CP-violation parameter delta_CP
could be extracted from two experiments at different baselines
just running neutrinos (in the 3-nu paradigm).  Parameters from
reactor and accelerator nu experiments are studied by Lindner et
al. in 
<A href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10252"> arXiv:1709.10252 </A>
delta_CP seems to be near negative pi/2
for which the optimum nu:nubar running isn't 1:1 but rather 2:1.

<H1>
*** Neutrino/Antineutrino parameter differences
</H1> <P>
In the 3-nu paradigm, the oscillation probabilities might differ
for nu and nubar, but the parameters should be the same.  With
CPT violation they might not be.  The ability of DUNE and Hyper-
Kamiokande to discover or limit this is studied in de Gouvea
and Kelly,

*** What month is this?
</H1> <P>
This is the September 2017 newsletter, but is being mailed in
mid October.   Most commercial publications have a date in the
future, for which I'm sure there is a good reason, but I don't
know what it is.  I originally issued the newsletter the last
few days of each month.  When a colleague started compiling the
references for me, that became the first few days of the next
month.  Now I get my own list from the arXiv, all starting with
1709 for this issue, sometime after the first of the month, and
the newsletter doesn't get finished till I go through them all.
And this is just a reminder that the text version of the
newsletter doesn't have full links for arXiv papers, but the web
version does.

*** Neutrino 2016 online proceedings
</H1> <P>
The proceedings for the Neutrino 2016 conference in London in July
2016 have been published online 14 months later,
<A href="http://iopscience.iop.org/issue/1742-6596/888/1">  
http://iopscience.iop.org/issue/1742-6596/888/1, 
</A>
leading me to
again question the value of conference proceedings when the slides
are available in a timely way and the proceedings are not.  Maybe
more people will look at the pictures than read the articles.
